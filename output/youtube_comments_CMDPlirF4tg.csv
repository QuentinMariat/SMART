I hope no tariff increase for anyone who supply Vatican goods. Hahaha. Congratulation Pope

"MAGA was bitching because he didn't speak English in his address as the new Pope. This is not breaking news, but they are all lunatics!"
"Well if pope Francis believed in him , must be a nice man"
Pedophile pope
"He looks fishy, I don't trust this pope"
It's a disaster on the making.
"BBC is the worst broadcast in the western world, I'm sure they are totally ashamed that the new pope is not black or Trans gender."
I have a question and I hope I dont cause anyone offence and im not getting at anyone with this. I am new to the faith and i am thinking about going to a Catholic church. I noticed that the congregations call the preist father. But in the bible Jesus says not to call any man father that we only have one father who is God. I know it must be ok because they wouldnt do it otherwise. Can someone explain this to me please.
Why do they appoint old old men as pope He will be dead in two years
we have a new pope in the big 2025 before gta 6.
The pope is a nothing I go straight to Jesus and God.
"Shame all those people missed out by being preoccupied with filming, as if there would be no other coverage"

"Someone here in the comments has posted that Pope Leo XIV is young compared to the age that his predecessors became Pope, reminding me of a superpower of our times known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). In what way? The United States of America (USA) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), were the two superpowers in the world from 1946 to 1991. The USSR fell in 1991, leaving the USA as the sole superpower in the world. Leonid Brezhnev, leader of the USSR from 1964 to 1982, passed away on 10th November 1982 at the age of 75. Brezhnev's successor, Yuri Andropov, was leader of the USSR from 1982 to 1984. Andropov passed away on 9th February 1984 at the age of 69. Andropov's successor as leader of the USSR was Konstantin Chernenko. Chernenko was leader of the USSR from 1984 to 1985. Chernenko passed away on 10th March 1985 at the age of 73, after which it was decided that a more ""youthful"" leader of the USSR be chosen, which is what happened. In 1985, the 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev succeeded Konstantin Chernenko as leader of the USSR, remaining leader of the USSR until the fall of the USSR in 1991. Regards, Michael M. Kamau, Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa, 9th May 2025."

"Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone), Sola Fide (faith alone), Sola Gratia (grace alone), Solus Christus (Christ alone), and Soli Deo Gloria (glory to God alone) No church or religion will prevail against the spoken word no matter how many traditions, sacrament, works! Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.( Matthew 11:28-30) How wonderful and merciful Gods GRACE is! Jesus coming in the flesh was a finished work of the cross, (John 19:30) for all that put their FAITH and TRUST PLUS NOTHING IN GODS FINISHED WORK, THEN SALVATION IS SIMPLE AND FREE! Then he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household. ( Acts 16:30-31)"

"Well, congratulations to the Catholics around the world, and also congratulations to the Latino/Hispanic community in the U.S. The new Pope is a Hispanic-American who speaks fluent Spanish, the son of Louis Prevost and Mildred Martinez, daughter of Spanish immigrants to the Dominican Republic who later immigrated to the U.S. where she was born and married and had three sons, one of them Pope Leo XIV (Robert Francis Prevost Martinez)."
"Great! They've selected their next idol! This is what catholism is. It's all about idolatry! They pray to not one GOD but many gods! They have many saints that they pray to not to mention mary and baby jesus and the jesus still nailed on the cross. They even have the burnt jesus in some country! smh. John 14:6 in the Bible says clearly that Jesus is the only way to reach God the Father, the source of all truth, and the path to eternal life. This is what happen if do you not seek GOD on your own and just rely on religion and tradition. The outcome? There's no relationship! Prove me wrong!"
The late Dave Allen would've had a field day with this.
"As an American I am absolutely stunned. However, when you take his Americanness out, sounds like he was a good candidate who didn't spend much time in the US to begin with. FOX commentators are mad he didn't speak English, but it's like....when in Rome...you speak freaking Italian. Or Latin."

"We wish you all the best as you take on this difficult job,we pray to God to give you wisdom to guide the Catholic church ."
1:49 well thats gonna go down well
"Till now it was almost an unspoken rule that there will never be an American pope. America rules the world economically, politically, and culturally. They dont need to rule religiously as well. I wonder if this is a sign that Americas power is waining enough these days for an American pope to be okay"
May God Bless you POPE
I wouldn't be surprised if the cia played a role in him being the pope

"Sad, that the people of the earth are looking for a fallen man to lead them, rather than God Almighty.

"Yeah, yeah, big deal. The pope at this time is more of a media spectacle than a leader of anything at all. It's a bit like the monarchies, except they are thorougly window dressing by now. Hey, but i am sure the Mango Mussolini will celebrate this as a ""huge win"", maybe even claiming he had made the ""deal"". Maybe by threating to levy tariffs on the Vatican? One wonders."
Congratulations

Vance went to visit pope francesco and Francesco died right after his visit! And now newly elected pope is an American! We live in a strange world!
"I just want to ask Romans, is it secretly written in Roman books that it is not permissible to be ruled by black pope. Am asking it just by try to imagine that it is not possible for more than thousand years no any black man has been able to raise and became pope. Or is it just because they have no wisdom, and have no ability to lead other races, have just been created to be slaves for other races?"
No trafficking this time
"Ricordo a tutti che cattolico significa universale, il contrario dei nazionalismi oggi in voga. Leone XXIV ormai il Padre di tutti i cattolici e non ha pi una sua nazionalit."
No he wont bring peace!! No pope is above Jesus Christ!! Come on people wake up!! The Bible says many will come saying peace when there is no peace. The Bible Also says the Antichrist will be accompanied by a FALSE PROPHET figure. So just put two and two together who you see where we are at. Place your faith in Jesus Christ!! Thats all thats important right now.

"Any hope the new pope will be any more caring than any of his tiptoeing predecessors? Any hope he'll emphatically honour the 50,000 children of Jesus worldwide, cruelly sexually molested by priests and protected by the Vatican, that, shamefully, prefers to point fingers rather than clean up their own very messy backyard? I doubt it. I call them the PPRBC - Papal Pedophile Ring Boys Club. Shame. Shame on them all!!"

Looking forward to hear his first Homily. Congrats H.E. Pope Leo from a Muslim sister and may you serve your fellow Catholics well. All smiles from most of the Cardinals signals major support.
"Annuntio Vobis gaudium magnum: Habemus Papam! Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum Dominum Robertum Franciscum Sanct Roman Ecclesi, Cardinalem Prevost Qui sibi nomen imposuit Leonem Decimum-Quartum I just love Latin and the way it's used for all the announcements and just in any occasion regarding this nearly 2 Millenia old institution, it always gets me emotional. I hope Leo XIV will be a great Pontiff, one who will follow Francis' path. P.S. He's not the first American Pope, he's the 1st from the US and North America and the 2nd American."
King of the pedos
Boooooooo
Protests against this
The previous Pope was also from America. This is the first from the USA.
"The pope is coming from the usa where there is vast income inequality, the funders of most conflicts, the supporters of a genocide, a privatised prison regime.....the usa is spiritually bankrupt and impoverished. This will hopefully stem the collapse."
Hope the new pope gives attention to Christians first. The earlier one was more worried about the peacefuls

First North American pope.
Congratulations! new pope
A new pope! I'm sure there are no scandals to be uncovered! Praise the bible!
congratulations to new pope. It will not surprising for the pope if he reads Bible that Christ was born in the second year of or so in the reign of Dariush ( Darius) much earlier than what the common believe and Jesus was lifted alive to heaven bu God and Jesus was not crucified as it is a concocted story so many scholars have discovered it ( S H by A J T ) . As Jesus the Christ was born in the reign of Dariush centuries earlier how then in Roman times Jesus could be prosecuted when there was no empire as Rome at that time .
Kinda reminds me a bit of the plot from Godfather 3.
The world was really hyped for this moment
Censorship is alive and well on this hokey liberal channel.
Jesus Christ please don't make this political!!! Don't connect this moment to trump.

"Congratulations his holiness. New hope. Wish you good health, strength and spiritual guidance"
Whtas wrong with the Americans! Hey it is not about you!

The Pope and the US President will have some interesting times together
USA USA USA USA USA
He speaks bullsh.t too.
I think Trump knows that the Pope will be American... he just posted an AI Image of himself as a Pope foretelling that the next Pope will be American... I think there is some script that is being played out.... will this be the last Pope? Petrus Romanus & St. Malachy
Thank You Lord for the New Pope

"O Jesus Eternal Priest, keep our Holy Father Pope Leo XIV within the Shelter of your Sacred Heart where he is safe from all the world's contagion. Holy Mother Mary, keep our Holy Father in your loving care. May he be always guided by the Holy Spirit! May he become an instrument of establishing lasting peace in the world!"

"His only job is to tell the Irish how to pronounce my names. I got idiot Irish, jewish, muslim, and english in america that say they can't pronounce my name, and I tell them ""oh you have difficult with my name? Why don't you call the Pope and see if he can pronounce it. That's what created the woke crap. The damn Irish didn't learn their Latin. If them little boys in Ireland used their mouth for what it's supposed to be used for like articulation instead of taking ejaculation like the english we wouldn't be having so many problems."

"I have always recognized the Pope as a Citizen of the World. To see him as the Citizen of any particular Country is doing an injustice to the rest of the World and creates a separation thats like a Wall. It really sickened me when I saw the American Family running around with their Flag's chanting, ""U.S.A., U.S.A.!"" We are the definition of Evil to the rest of the World alongside Israel! To me, he is now and forever ""Pope Leo XIV, leader of Vatican City!"" #TrumpIsTrashy"

No!!! Just what the hell were they thinking!?
"What is it with this soviet style trend of appointing impossibly old men to high office? Bidens, Trumps, Popes, fortunately we are not doing it. At least not yet.... We just can't let go of seventies politics."

Bob the Pope. Can he fix it?
Very sad luis tagle is not the pope
Very sad luis tagle is not the pope
"Speaking as a Catholic, I found it strange that on this supremely historic occasion as the first American Pope - *this priest from Chicago chose to NOT speak a single word of English on the balcony! How about something like 'God Be With You!'* I am also troubled by his social media posts. He seems to be more bothered by Vice-president JD Vance than say, abortion, or the Communist Chinese Party that enslaves and even kills its people! He is said to have been close to Pope Francis who was considered very liberal, even Socialist. Is he Francis 2.0?"
May god bless the new Pope
Pretty sure the last pope was American too...
Very disappointing. White. American.
"The devil is a lair, he corrupts everything God created. God did not give us religion, God did not give us pope, He gave us His Son Jesus Christ that whosoever will repent and believe in Christ, shall be saved. What are you people doing?

My class watched it live hapen
The true Church is made up of individual believers (Living Stones) inhabited by GOD the HOLY SPIRIT who confess that JESUS is the CHRIST (just like Peter's confession) Who died for our sins (in our place) and raised from the dead on the 3rd day. See Peter's explanation of the true Church in 1 Peter 2. The Church is spiritual (the KINGDOM of GOD does not come with observation/it is within you Luke 17:20-21 KJV). It is not a palace in Rome.

5:05 Love the close ups of the Cardinals!
"You are an empty chalice... empty... A zero, no thought, no will... Awaiting only my Lord Choronzon"
What a beautiful day! I hope the new pope will spread love and kindness to all over the world using his great language skills too! Look at all priests smiles on their faces. Thiss a happy day
An American? Move aside bread and wine its now beer and burgers for everyone Just when you thought the Catholic Church couldnt have any LESS credibility
A Great Choice
People dressed in red people dressed in black with a bright smile on their faces.
NO not the first american Pope. The first US pope. They certainly need it. Pope Francis was the fist american pope.
"Pope Francis was American, stupid lady. Remember United States is NOT American, it is part of the American continent."
Don't be so glad for his citizenship....He is our Pope for the world for not America why to enjoy overly....
Congratulations to the Holy Catholic Church
May God flow through him and his ministry Amen
"Congratulations Pope Leo. Love from America A good correction from Pope Francis. Hes nothing like Francis , thank goodness. Hes more like Pope John Paul II, A centrist and moderate, not political. A win, win for Catholics."
Trump's wish came true!
"I was half expecting trump to appear on the balcony but I woke up, I was having a nightmare !"

May he help Donald and his gang.

"Pope Louis the XIV, the Sun Pope?"
"Donny couldn't take the throne of angland, so he settled for a pointed hat. And if he doesn't step on pakistan and india soon, he'll be as dumb as obama."
Is he child molester by any chance? Thats all I care about pretty much.
"Wow ! How stupid is society for a few to be rich many must stand in crowds, cheering to be poor. What a scam."
Congrats to a great American Pope 2025 of 21st century
Tariffs on faith?
Wonder how many kids this one have molested.
He's Young! God be with him
Second actually.also Bergoglio was american. Latin America is America As well.
Congratulations J.D. Vance !
Congratulations Your Holiness!
Che Dio lo benedica lAmerica e gli Americani. E il Papa sicuramente sar una voce e guida morale per confortare il popolo americano per superare un momento comunque cos complesso
"BORN IN THE USA (CHICAGO, ILLINOIS) BUT WORKED IN PERU FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES *** IN 2022 HE BECAME A CLOSE FRIEND OF POPE FRANCIS, BECOMING HIS RIGHT-HANDED ARM *** ON HIS DEATHBED, FRANCIS I EXPRESSED HIS WILL AND DESIRE THAT ROBERT PREVOST BE HIS SUCCESSOR, AND SO IT WAS THAT LEO XIV IS THE CONTINUATION OF FRANCIS I"
The people who voted against them; probably life changing.
"Blessed are you as the New Pope in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ CONGRATULATIONS"
Hold your judgement until he proves himself in action.
New king of the pedos

"An Augustine Pope. Caring for the poor, dispossessed, immigrants and the persecuted. Viva La Papa"
"My comment on this video, A new Deceiver The devil Catholic Church have just revealed, who's taking this world this wicked Heathen World to (Hell) in a hand basket, woe unto the Catholic Church and this Pope and they follow this day, Rise and Shine Israel (Yasharahla), my name is high priest (Hawdawyah Yasharahla) Son of Zion from The Tribe of Benjamin from the House of David only, I want to give all thanks and praise to The Most High (YAHAWAH Ba Ha Sham YAHAWAHSHI) Maschiah my King only, this day and every day for the rest of my life Ahman.

My comment woe unto all the Heathens and woe unto all the Catholic priest and all religious leaders woe unto all of them this day Ahman."
Second American Pope The first Was Francis (Francisco ) Second pope LEO XIV
An American pope. Trump has had something to do with this.
"American pope? Didn't they tell the Ukrainian because he lives in Australia, he will be an Australian pope. Doesn't this guy live in Peru? Why couldn't the Ukrainian guy represent his birth country and this guy gets automatically called American pope? I am so confused, stop changing the rules."
Now the question is... is he a liberal pope or a MAGA pope?
"Well, the church is going back to the conservative ways. This new pope worked in Peru were he was accused of covering several pedophile priest. He's friends of the Sionist. What a f***ing way to dishonor Pope Francis and what he fought for."
White Pope again!?
Viva il Papa. Dear God thank you for our new Pope.
An American pope? Cool we'll get to sew him on Jimmy Kimmel and stuff now.
dog of izreals?
I was hoping for an Asian Pope
Up yours too pope Leo
So now that the new Pope has been announced as an American will Trump now claim that the Vatican City will be the 51st State
CONGRATULATIONS POPE LEO! FROM PHILIPPINES
What a waste of time and money. Imagine the good the Catholic church could do with all of their wealth??? This is so antiquated and ridiculous.
No asians wud win that possesion.
Wonderful
"Noooo, not an American!! He has bribed his way in like Trump, the Heritage Foundation has their boy in the Vatican and the White House."
"Ppl who put their believe in human, they will doom . Especially we have a lot history about bad popes. Put your faith n trust on Jesus Christ not pope, specially pope choose by human for their who knows what kind motives behind it . Pope just like pastor nothing more"
I wonder if he's going to change his name to pete?
It has to do with Trump. Theres no way.
"""Good News from the Vatican"" -- Robert Silverberg Maybe next we'll have a robot/AI pope??"
Oh the Idol worshipping Catholic Church has a new pope. How wonderful
"so wait, it wasn't Donald Trump? Republicans are declaring sanctions against the vatican."
"All of this when the fairy in the sky doesn't even exist! Religion, the greatest fairy tale - ever told!!"
Pope Chicago pan pizza.
A catholic man... again
I need to sit down for a moment!
Jst try to read surah maryum in Quran as God has explained the birth of Jesus
Congratulations to the new Pope Robert Prevost! Love from Peru!
"God answers prayers. Maybe not in the package you envisioned, but he always comes through. A statement is being made about true Christianity, kindness and God's love for all mankind."
In ths world of 5 generation I wonder how stupid all u r to believe nd waste ur time to wait for black or white smoke to come out
"This conclave feels like it was rushed imo. I'm still devastated when Pope Francis died. As a Catholic and a Filipino, i'm just disappointed a little bit that Cardinal Tagle didn't get elected as Pope. He could be the successor of Pope Francis. But whoever wins the conclaves in the future, i will still support it. I support our new Pope Leo XIV, his holiness."
Yay anti-Trump pope! Very good news.
The words of Allah the creator of ths whole mankind has been delivered through prophet Muhammad (pbuh) through angel jebraeal nd their is no concept of any pope or else
"O meu corao est cheio de felicidade, uma felicidade imensa. Espero agora que o Santo Padre Leo XIV coloque a doutrina da nossa Igreja no seu devido lugar e rejeite todas as ideias sinistras criadas antes dele. Viva o Santo Padre Leo XIV. VIVA O PAPAI! My heart is filled with happiness, greatest happiness. Now I hope Holy Father Leo XIV puts our Church doctrine in its place and dismisses all the sinister ideas created before him. Long Live Holy Father Leo XIV. VIVA PAPA!"
With the passage of time its really sad tht we knew not
Its only one Allah and prophet Muhammad is the last messenger of Allah pbuh
"An American Pope, an American leading the world (DJT), the World Cup in the USA, and the Olympics in Los Angeles. . This WINNING HAS TO STOP. Its EXHAUSTING. Now all we need is Canada and Greenland, and everything will be just fine."
If he keeps speaking up for Palestine I will accept him.
Good choice to bring back morality and humanity!
A new Pope - brought to you by China
"SO NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO USE OUR SPIRIT AGAINST US, REMEMBER THE COMMONWEALTH"
"So the US bought the conclave, cool"

The first American Pope was Francisco. BBC gotting it wrong on live TV since it was invented
"6:30 The Catholic Church is so much bigger than Rome, and the world should be so much bigger than just America!"
"USA / Peru, Amen"
End of days
Thku my pope im getting ready to go
God bless his church and the new Pope Leo
"Technically , he is the second South American Pope since he is a Naturalized citizen thereof of Peru and as Cardinal he also represented his adopted country !!"
I think the Cardinals breathed in a little too much black smoke this time around.
did Donald trump knew anything about pope going to be elected?
5:00 Someone who could please both sides? There are more than two sides! This is not America where everything is divided into progressive and conservative. Lets stop living in this divided mindset. Not everything can and should be divided into two camps!! It is not helpful
Congratulations
We got new pope before GTA 6
What beautifully emotional yet probably overwhelming experience for him. From cardinal to pope. Congratulations
I hope he tames Trump with Vatican Voodoo.
So Britain ....how is your government gonna sell out to donny 'two dolls' and his extortion ?
I didnt realise the Vatican has money troubles. Money is never for free. Question always is what the pope had to promise in return for receiving money from American donors. Seems like America has managed to corrupt the papacy as well!
"..What?? Apparently, Leonard Leo did oppo research on some progressive cardinals, in an attempt to sway who the next pope is gonna be (based on the book Opus by Gareth Gore). Is this the result of that? (And yes, I wish I was kidding with this, but sadly this is the world we live in today. And no, I am not a conspiracy theorist. But I believe American billionaires have the fingers in everything they can get away with!)"
Well done Trump for getting Robert the job now tou own the Catholic church.
What we need is less American influence in the world. Not more!!
"As a modern orthodox Jewish doctor from Tel Aviv , Israel I salute you Papa Leo XIV , may you bring holy traditional values back to the holy Roman Catholic Church swiftly . May G-d bless the new Pope , The entire Roman Catholic community, and the entire world please pray for me as Ive just been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and thymus gland cancer . I love you all . Doctor Kastien , Tel Aviv, Israel I love the new Pope Leo XIV already. Hes a good holy man . The world will be blessed by this new Pope . Hes very different from Francis. The Windy city has spoken out with the old , in with the Pope Leo XIV is going to be awesome MAKE TGE VATICAN GREAT AGAIN ! . MAKE THE HOLY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HOLY AND CATHOLIC AGAIN"
2027 Babylon down
I'm suspicious whether the Trump effect had anything to do with this. Maybe the vatican wanted some influence over Trump!
American Pope??Oh no.Hope he does not bring tariff on the Prostitutes
Allahu Akbar
La ilahe ilallah Muhamedu Resulullah
When will Catholics elect a Pope who accepts that women are equally able to lead?
Who cares anyway
"A life of service denying one half of Perus population agency of their own bodies, contraception and divorce. Medieval."
"This is SUS!!! First Vance visits the Pope, then the Pope dies, then an American is elected as Pope!!!! If this new Pope likes Trump, then we know there was a cue! Don't let Trump get his hands on the Vatican!!"
Congratulations dear Papa Leo May the good Lord guide and Bless you
Holy Spirit. Thank You.
*The world doesn't need a pope - we only need Jesus Christ the Son of God. John 14:6.*
"I closed my eyes and saw the new pope coming with three swords, world communism, homosexuality acceptance in the church, and the one world religion. Enjoy"
"Dear very old, surviving WW2 veteran that was expecting at 18:00 to see VE Day coverage in the last decade that you and almost all your compatriots are likely to be alive and instead see this coverage for a country that isnt even Catholic - I feel bad for you. I am really mad with you BBC - disgraceful."
YESSS! I'm not Christian or Catholic but I really loved and appreciated Pope Francis and I was hoping for this man to be chosen as the new Pope! I just didn't realize he was American originally. I thought he was Peruvian! How awesome! Long live Pope Leo XIV!
GOD bless POPE LEO And all my good brothers & sisters Of this world
First US pope
"Well, the first American pub would be pope Francis, even though hes Puerto Rican, Puerto Rico is part of the United States. Technically, this new pope is the second American pope even though he was born in Chicago hes the second American pope. Hes not the first you can Google it. It says Pope Francis is the first American pope."
He is the first Pope from the United States of America and the first from North America and sure not the first from Americas.
Glorious Day. The Lion.
You know you're getting old when the police are younger than you. You know you're nearly dead when the Pope is younger than you.
Americas Golden Age is beginning! Now bow before us!
)) )) )) )) )). )) )) )) )) )). . )) )) )). )). )). : (( )) . )). . )) . . )).
So no one voted for Trump to be next pope!
He is the second beast.
"First North American pope. We already had a pope from the Americas, Pope Francis. First pope hailing from the United States of America."
?
maybe chicago won't have as many murders now
Biden is dedicated practicing Catholic. Trump sells his own Bibles when never reading one.
"Why, BBC, is it ""important"" to note how much time he DIDN'T spend in the US? Anti-American drivel."
The Western liberals have a meltdown to know the US passport is NOT disadvantage in the Trump era.
"Congratulations to His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV!"
"As an anglian charismatic Christian, I was so happy and delighted for the new pope and for the roman Catholic Church. As well of course, the first pope from the United States. To all the catholics around the world, i am with you, god is bressing upon you. congratulations, Pope leo the 14th. Greetings from the UK ."
"Congratulations and Love to His Holiness, from Pennsylvania."
"WoW God is Loyal, and Perfect!"
Trump: i did that
Sounds like another lefty Pope
"That was quick, I thought the conclave would take ages"
"WOW, first American pope? Trump really does want America first."
How ridiculous another OLD man who will not last long besides the US does not even have a majority of Catholics.
"Just what the world needs, a Pope born in the Unholy Land, elected in Rome, the city where those who murdered Jesus came from."
First American pope? Disinformation fake news!
Im sure this pic was because of Trump and the rise of the religious right here in America. Way to pick it love you guys. Im finally starting to come back to the Faith.
Donald Trump's influence knows no bounds.
MAGA pope
"As provincial of the Augustinians, Prevost allowed Father James Ray, a priest then accused of abusing minors whose ministry had been restricted since 1991, to reside at the Augustinians' St. John Stone Friary in Chicago in 2000, despite its proximity to a Catholic elementary school. When Prevost was Bishop of Chiclayo, three victims reported to civil authorities in 2022 after there was no movement on their canonical case filed through the diocese. Victims have since claimed Prevost failed to open an investigation, sent inadequate information to Rome, and that the diocese allowed the priest to continue saying mass."
"Pope Francis was American, South American. Pope Leo is North American ."
"Just as when Pope Francis was chosen, I've got a bad feeling about Pope Leo XIV. He'll probably be worse than his predecessor. This may be a punishment from God for our sins. All we can do is repent and pray."
MAKE VATICAN GREAT AGAIN
"He probably works for the bbc, nonse"
Ot another American!!! We have had enough...
"pray the lord takes him by the hand, and guides his way earnestly and decisively to lead his people thru these troubling times"
"NO TARIFFS, NO POPE!"
Well if he has worked in perou he is very well educated in poverty and hardship
This will annoy a lot of people.
Its rigged.
5:10 Most situations that he would have to say something are NOT both sides.
he's Peruvian watch out trumpy loves deporting South Americans
Soooo disappointed . Will be a field day for Tramp.
Love you pope we hope under ur guide we will have pice and prosperity
MARA!!!!! MAKE AMERICA RELIGIOUS AGAIN!!!

Les Amricains qui crent des guerres qui vendent des Arme pour tuer des enfants et des femmes innocents dans les 4 coins de la terre et aprs a vient parler de religion
"I'm not a practicing Catholic, but I believe that there is hope for the world when religious leaders are celebrated & embraced. Spirituality is needed to remember that we are ALL God's children! I hope he's as principled as his predecessor!"
Maybe Pope Leon can lessen all the hate we get here in America May God be with him
Encore un complot des Amricains

Another bergolio
"This will build bridge between vaticano & w.h... so, U.S. getting ""Stronger"" and best allies... Great!!! Because of his Position and Power to ""Appoint New Bishop"" make him ""Familiar"" to most of the electors & incluent the... but what has been informed by medias, the 108 cardinals was ""Pope Francis Ideas"", but in fact, this man was the one who pope Francis Trust as an advisor on the appointing the clergy men.. So, here we Got!!! Hoy Spirit HELP??!!!.. What a joke. Make sure he ""CLEAN-UP"" all his college at Rom. Curia, who involved in Financial, Vatica Bank,Sex Abused casses and Vatican Properties Scandals alright.. make sure dont become theirs popyy ya... So, lets go PARTY!!!! Yeahhhh.... Gbu lol"
"Congratulations to Cardinal Prevost on becoming pope. I wish him and the Catholic Church the best, and that they honor Francis's legacy."
Der schnste Moment
From Chicago to Chiclayo
"God Bless Pope Leo XIV!! He's not the first American Pope, however. Pope Francis was the first one. The correct thing to say is Pope Leo XIV is the first Pope from North America."
It's important to note that the new Pope spent many years outside of America so this can't possibly be a win for Trump It's not a win for Trump No no no we hate Trump we hate Trump it can't possibly be a win for Trump even though it is American...TDS
How many altar boys to qualify?
I think President Trump has a premonition or whoever made the video of him wearing the Popes clothes that the next pope will be from America
Is the new pope supporting the genocide in Gaza too??????
Yo I would love to see sone Asian Pope like Chinese!!! But McDonald's will work too.
Does Trump know there will be an American pope in advance when he post his pope image?
The United States of Fascist
Pope Lion not Leo
I thought it was gonna be Joe Rogan
"Vatican as the 51st USA state, new goal for Trump."
"All that adulation for people who covered up the abuse of children,what sick and twisted people ."
Celebrate with the altar boys
Long Live the Catholic Church!
How many has this one molested?
God Indeed Blessed America with its First American Pope! God Bless America Once More!
"Papam habemus! Spirit Holy, Lead him, keep him"
"It goes without saying that, the new pope is totally nervousness."

Wait for those Chicago style thick communion wafers.
Thank you Jesus
Born in America? Another reason to leave catholicism
Congratulations Pope Leo XIV. Love from India
"Re Bolokelwe Mopapa, Leqhosa La Jesu Kriste..."
"The new Pope improves the situation of animals in the world, in Africa and in Arab countries, an animal is not a thing, animals are sentient beings"
"Snide remark saying he's ""spent many years OUTSIDE America"". We didn't all vote for the idiot in the White House."
"Good luck, but what amazed me is the short time between one pope passing and a new pope being appointed. Yet it has taking decades for the catholic church to investigate its wrongs .... Hypocrisy and a mirror image of all religions and politics across the world today ... And exactly why ppl born catholic are totally disinterested"
The Church is not truly ready to spread the faith globally.
He Better not be a woke lefty we are sick and tired of that bs already. Catholicism can never bend to WOKE ideology
"New Pope, improve the situation of homosexuals in the world in Africa and in Arab countries"
Pope Francis was the first American pope. Already forgotten?
Long life papa Leo god bless you in Jesus name
Praying for his safe and loving rule. <3
"Brotherhood, Justice, Prosperity, equality ,"
Its to fill the coffiers with American money.
The couter-balance to Trump. What a chess move.
"I hope this Pope isn't too liberal. You can have compassion/love and not be for illegals as it hurts others who are not illegal in one form or another. You can have compassion/love while still not supporting criminals and supporting their punishments. You can have compassion/love for supporting homeless while not being a doormat either and having processes that are required for them to follow. You can have compassion/love for wanting fair trade deals. You can have compassion/love for not supporting lots of abortion reasons, let alone fully."
The clasp of America across the protestant divide has just gotten stronger.
Trump idiot felon are you going to make fun of this Holy Father.
"new Pope, from all over the world"
Probably rigged. A guy that wasn't reallly mentioned. Haha
Ah the new puppet master of an invisible fantasy sky wizard!
Pope Bob is a traditional Catholic and charity worker. Basically John Paul 2.0
cringe
"Wow, that election was Fast! Is it possible that Mr. Trump may have United the Vatican, in the same way he ""inspired"" the Canadian and Australian elections"
"Congratulations to his Holiness, wish him a good luck!"
God bless Pope Leo XIV. Viva il Papa.
This is so stupid and primitive. When will humanity grow out of this stuff?
An American Pope! History was made
May Pope Leo XIV bring us all together. May he bring peace and love in the world. God bless us ALL!
May our new Pope help in bringing the USA back to God
"the world,has the new Pope !!"
Carpe diem! Saluto
So a rapist voted pope who knew lmao
So he's the next one to kick the bucket from 'death by pudding' eh?..
BBC in mourning
A new pope for the Roman Catholic Cult.
God bless Pope Leo XlV
Just make sure this American Pope takes instructions from the American President or he won't be Pope for very long.
Pope Leo Peace
Don't pronounce the ST at the end of Prvost....
Viva il Papa
Well done YANK
"In the end the truth always wins out and LOVE WINS THE WAR OF WILLS. All evil spirits are officially destroyed forever. To the righteous, we won. It's almost time to fly, under two months. To the wicked, your time is over. Always TRUST THE DIVINE PLAN."
Really weird how the last pope died after meeting jd vance and than american pope gets voted in..... Clearly people behind the scenes making things happen
first American Pope
Congratulations!
Hope he act as the pope not American or isrl puppet.
Maybe Trump will put ptessute on the Vatican to become the 51 state and leave Canada alone!
"Hello Muslims, do you see how Christians celebrate the religion, moved to tears for the leadership? I am not a Catholic and not quite religious, but just look at the joy and celebrations, the messages of hope and peace. If that were the case for many Muslims, the world may be a better place in the Middle East and for everyone. Love peace, not war! Love even your ENEMIES is the message of Christianity as commanded by Jesus."
"If he's similar to Bergoglio, how can you say he can please both sides? Bergoglio provoked a lot of scandal and division within the Church. I'd rather say that, being appointed by Bergoglio, we cannot hope the new pope to be better than the previous one. The fact that he lived for many years in South America also seem an ugly coincidence to me. The big trial of the Catholic Church goes on and probably will get ever worse. But everything is permitted by Christ Himself because the war between Heaven and hell is at its peak and Jesus wants to test everyone's faith."
Somehow Trump's going to take credit for this.
The first pope who is younger than I am.
"Will they ever elect an actual Christian, another one who covered up abuse in S America, disgusting"
am from the 80's and I remember when Catholics were quiet at mass
God bless Amrica
"Beware of all religions. Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 7: 15) For God is our true Father. So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions. But when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. This is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, your name be hallowed, Your kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven, Give us today our daily bread, Forgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us. And do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father. (Jesus the Messiah at Matthew 6: 6-15) Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you. (at Matthew 7: 1-2) In truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die. (at John 8: 51) Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets. Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it. (Matthew 7: 12-14) I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage. The thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness. (John 10: 9-10) Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. (Matthew 7: 15) Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 7: 21) I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die. (John 11: 25-26) I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world (John 12: 47) Whoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. (Matthew 10: 32-34) I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too. (John 14: 6-7) An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? He answered, Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments. (Matthew 22: 35-40) There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends. (John 15: 13) Do not call any man on earth father ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called teacher ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah. (Matthew 23: 9-10) Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name (Matthew 24: 4) Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, mens love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. (Matthew 24: 11-13) Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time. (Matthew 28: 20) Yours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Thursday the 8th of May 2025: (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us. Let it always be you. Pray to God often, as prescribed above, before it is too late."
"What's worse, celebrities becoming astronauts or people screaming over an old man in a dress"
The corruption of the Catholic Church is mind-blowing. Comrade Trump went to the funeral to buy the new pope. I am leaving the Catholic Nazi Church today! 1:33
"Correctly speaking Pope Leo the 14th is the first pope of the United States because America is both North and South, and we had had our first American Pope with our just deceased Pope Francis who was from Argentina"
God bless you all
For once give us a Pope who can speak from his heart and not from a prepared speech probably written by others.
The Prayers of President Trump & his family for God to save His Christian Church on earth has emerged! And the whole world saw the efforts of Barron in proclaiming Jesus and Mary the only Way. America will continue to be great!
Please pray for the new Pope so that he can lead the Church to the best of his abilities.
Trump got his man in then. The Vatican will make a beautiful hotel and possibly a casino attached?
Congratulations
Bunch of clowns at the idiot bbc cut it off as it gets important. Idiots!
"THESE PEOPLE LOVE THE POPE BUT HATE GOD'S WAY! WHILE THE COLONIALIST ENSLAVED PEOPLE, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON THE SIDE TELLS THEM TO FORGIVE THEIR ENEMIES. END TIMES HERE! THEY LOOK LIKE A LAMB BUT DEVOUR LIKE A LION."
Paying the bills
Vatican will tekeover by Islam and popes name will be changed to Muhammad soon
As human beings how is this benefitting us
I dont like American pope. America already has too much influence
"All peoples throughout the world, peace be with you. This is the peace of the Resurrective Christ, a humble and perseverant peace which comes from GodGod who loves us all unconditionally. Let us keep in our ears the weak voice of Pope Francis that blesses Rome. The Pope who blessed Rome gave his blessing to the world, to the entire world that morning of Easter. Allow me to follow up on that blessing. God loves us. God loves everyone. Evil will not prevail. We are all in the hands of God. Therefore, without fear, united hand in hand with God and amongst ourselves, let us go forward. We are the disciples of Christ. Christ goes before us. The world needs his light. Nobody needs him like the bridge to God and his love. Help us and all others to build bridges with dialogue, with meeting, to be one common people living always in peace. Thank you to Pope Francis. I should also like to thank all my Cardinal brethren who have chosen me to be the successor of Peter and to walk with you as a united church, always seeking peace and justice, seeking to work with men and women who are faithful to Jesus Christ without fear to proclaim the gospel, to be missionaries. I am a son of St. AugustineAugustinianAugustine who said, ""With you, I am a Christian and for you a bishop."" And I think in that sense we can all walk together to that homeland, that home which God has prepared for us. To the Church of Rome, a very special greeting. We have to seek together to be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges and dialogue, always ready to accept like this great piazza with its arms. We have to show our charity, presence, and be in dialogue with love. And I'd also like to say a greeting in Spanish to all those who are particularly dear to memy beloved diocese in Peruwhere a faithful people accompanied their bishop to share their faith with him and who has done so much to be a faithful church. To all you, brothers and sisters of Rome, of Italy, of the entire world, we must be a synodal church, one which goes forward and which always seeks peace, charity, and to be close to those who suffer. Today is the day of supplication to the Madonna of Pompeii. Our mother Mary always wanted to accompany us and be near us to help us with her love. And I should like therefore to pray together with you. Let us pray for this new mission, for the entire Church, and for peace in the world. And let us ask for this special grace from Mary, our God: Hail Mary, full of grace. You are blessed amongst all women, and blessed be the fruit of your womb. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners and be present at the hour of our death. Amen."
"He should be the all the religions pope, and you should agree with you To the pope Congratulation."
Every cardinal will be asked this question upon returning to their countries: what were you thinking ? . Having said that may God strengthen and guide him and us in our continued journey as the pilgrim church on earth
Congratulations God bless you leading off the world
"They got their own man in Vatican now, thanks for successful operation on Easter by the mysterious ""Eyeliner"""
Funny how the media is trying to diminish his American connection. The man was born in the United States for God sakes. Hes an American. 100%.
"Oh shiit Trump has put his Yankee antichrist pawn in the Vatican, the Muslims are going to see their prophecy come true."
And yes he's a Republican lol get in yay
In english is pope Lion not leo
Congratulations POPE LEO XIV Our new POPE!
May the world find peace with this New Pope!
"Greetings to the new Pope, American and Peruvian citizen"
All I see is a giant flock of sheep and a wolf in sheeps clothing
Thats why trump posted that picture on his X right???? Now i get it..he wasnt mocking..he gave us a clue..shyeeet is this planned?
Im Christian but I dont believe this type of religion
Real News for once
Pretty sure Argentina is in America...
Welcome the new cardinal..
God bless him
The Catholic Church is declining in the USA. May God use him to bring America back home to Rome.
"He was born on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. September 14. Anyone who knows me, knows why I know this Feast"
I am so excited for the Catholic Church and Pope Leo XIV. Congratulations to him. I pray longevity and health to him.
Do you mean JD Vance visits the Pope 36 hours later he's dead and an American Trump's friend is elected Pope? Makes sense
"USA = American, no one cares about the continent stop being intellectually dishonest you weird commenters"
Please may he stand up to the Orange Menace.
Another pedophile protector
USA USA USA
Jesus Jesus Christ
Will need triple security have a feeling some will be planning a suprise
Ew another celebrated ball of slime
"Long live pope Leo , may the almighty God bless your days' in Jesus name Amen"
Greatest Pope ever
Guys just accept that hes been a resident in peru but is American yall just cant accept it
"He better not come to USA because he holds a PERUVIAN nationality, he'll be deported to EL SALVADOR by the loser CONVICTED R*PIST TRUMP"
"Popes have always supported fascism, maybe if he gies to America they will deport him"
God bless you
You will never ever have a black pope even though jesus was black himself
The human worship resumes.
Heaven await you holy father.
A pope is useless these days since the catholic religion has been perverted.
USA!!...USA!!.....USA!!!
Bless the new Pope Leo XIV !
Long live the pope
The abomination of distillation will soon be standing in the holy place
Congrats to Cardinal Robert Prevost and America from Ukraine !
"As long as the US is the global hegemon, it was a virtual certainty there would never be a US Pope. Make of that what you will."
Strange it wasn't orange smoke .. Donnie very upset
I guess Trump got his wish!
FINALLY God Bless you Pope Leo XIV
"Aaaan back to the daily routine cardinals.....""bent over altar boi""...."
Cheering for the same tripe
3:45 He's in favour of missionary position then
BBC's has an issue with the pope being American
"Dicen el primer pap americano. Nada ms lejos de la verdad. El primer Papa americano fue Francisco. Amrica va desde Canad hasta Argentina pasando por Norteamrica, Amrica del centro y Amrica del Sur. En todo caso es el primer papa estadounidense"
Yeah cause we all speak Italian where's the subtitles
Make Vatican Great Again!
"Why is the BBC saying ""the first American pope""? The last Pope was also from America. Leo XIV is the first Pope from the USA. America and ""The USA"" are very different, although I suspect many citizens of the USA might think they're the only Americans. Surely in the context of the Pope it is important to get the geography right!"
I sense the hand of God here
Proud of America
Le roi est mort vive le roi.
An American? Have Musk n Trump paid to have this happen? Too much of a coincidence
"If Trump was not the president, Robert Prevost so called leo wouldn't be the pope"
"The first Pope Leo talked down Attila the Hun to spare the civilized world. Now if Leo tried, I'm sure the modern day barbarian attila would spit on his shoes, ask if he even wore a suit and if he's ever said thank you once."
Donald Trump is going to hate this - it was rigged
I'm not a Christian. If something I'm a Zen Buddhist and an atheist. I send my love and best wishes to all the humanity and today especially to my Christian brothers and sisters. I hope the new Pope will be a force for good and love in the World. Congratulations!
Whahaha such a political move....an american pope.....ffs...
Did he do a song and dance to win?
"""Its called soccer"" -the new american pope probably"
I don't know what to think...It does not seem right somehow..sorry..
Brasil
Hallelujah
Brasil
One may think it was going to be a black pope the way we fight like hell for a white Jesus
Biggest example of mass brainwashing you will ever see
where is Enrico Pucci?
We Africa wee are going to elected ours Why American not infom us this election Buytheway
Chicago .... wasn't that centre of the kiddy mo lester investigations?????
Trump will certainly take credit
Now Vatican could be the 51st state.
"""We have a Pope, a tremendous Pope, an American Pope, best Pope in the history of the Church"" - Trump"
"God help the church,we didn't need another serpent,like Francis. Cardinals you have disappointed us"
NOOO IT WAS SUPOSSED TO BE PUCCI!!!!!
"We just had an ""American"" Pope from Argentina. This is the first Pope from the United States. Honestly the BBC must have a map kicking around somewhere?"
Well done Trumo
Noice last name
"In 2000, Prevost allowed Father James Ray, an Augustinian priest, to reside at St. John Stone Friary in Chicago. Ray had been suspended from public ministry since 1991 due to credible accusations of sexual abuse of minors. The Augustinians noted that Ray was assigned a monitor while at St. John Stone. Ray was moved to a different residence in 2002 when the US Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted stricter rules for handling priests accused of abusing minors.[15][16][b]"
"Lets see what he says about trump,whats he mubberling about ,speak English."
"Pope Francis was from South America! Pope Leo is from the United States of America, so not the first."
"IS THIS A SAD MO FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH? ANOTHER LIB POPE. TRUMP WILL BE HAPPY BECAUSE THE NEW POPE IS AN AMERICAN. USA, USA! OR JERRY, JERRY!."
Guessing there will be no Tariff's on Church Wine then from the USA
"He s actually more a peruvian pope, he has lived decades here and he acquired peruvian nationality an ID years ago. His main Focus has been latin american issues. If you listen to his speech, he didnt mention US at all, he mentioned Per and gave special thanks to his people there (he is bishop in a main peruvian city)."
Hope he's not racist like the X pope
Denies covering up child abuse in Peru. Surprised that the BBC didn't offer him a senior management job
Congratulations @catholic for our new pope Leo. God might bless you as you take the mantle to lead the Church to greater heights.
Trump didnt win? That election was rigged!
Imagine this imagine without the stupid enormous red banner. Ffs bbc.
Wow! I hope he is a kind and loving man.
Just to make clear who rules Italy
He has a history of protecting priests who have committed child ab'se
Good choice. USA needs more faith right now.
He should immediately condemn israeli zionism.
Habemus Papam Pope Leo XIV World Peace
This man allowed priests to get away and reside in the church with sexual abuse. Shameful. God will punish the wicked
Paddington Pope?
Congratulations to all our American friends and Colleagues ! Stunning result !
I keep imagining I'm hearing the Blues Brothers singing Sweet Home Chicago....
I've come to the conclusion religion is a form of brainwashing.....I was dragged up a a catholic and none of it made sense
Rumor has it that Trump and Vance threatened the last pope and church taxes exempt status unless they elected an American to control. It is the end of times
A new senior Catholic paedophile
Cardinal Prevost of the Augustine Order becomes Pope Leo. I would expect an Augustine to be nothing other than a Leo!!!!
Praise the Lord
I TOLD YOU ALL IT WOULD BE PINK SMOKE!
Cardinal RFP as Pope Leo 14
"GOD bless the Pope Leo XIV. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen."
Ah new king of the pedos!
You'd think he'd be taller...
The Pope can never be black . But why ??
As I said yester day cathilics do not repond to the insultsvthat were showered yesterday....we are mature than that congratulations fellow catholics...and congrats to the Holy father and all flkry to the Holy Triune God
"The woke Angelican BBC is unable to digest this , the chatterbox commentator is purposely undermining his nationality"
"American pope, goodbye morality!!"
Trump will find a way to take credit for this American Pope.
Go Pope Bob.
at least the children will be safe today....
"""Pater et filius et spiritus sanctus"" translates to ""Father and Son and Holy Spirit, PATER =FATHER ,JULIUS CAESAR ET FILIUS = SON ,PRINCEPS = PRINCE, PAC ROMANUS ,PRINCE OF PEACE AUGUSTUS,VENUS THE MOTHER OF GOD"
Whats the score? is this half time? Where's peter the Roman?
The Church was challenged by divisive politics.
FINALLY WE'RE BACK HOME
well come pop
Is this one pedophile too???
How long before trumps takes credit for this?
Im glad that he didnt speak English. It goes to show that hes a pope for all.
Y quien gano el concurso por fin???
Congratulation Catholics for a new pope
A pope that can be blackmailed by Trump with funding and tax.
"I love how she keeps going back to him not spending time in the US, even though he is from here. I get it though. It could taint his legacy just by the bad reputation we now have as a nation. Thanks for being painfully clear about who he really is and doing what you can to help avoid the stink of being American right now."
Pls let the catholic go back to the traditional way no more liberal movement
"The crowd sounded shocked - and perhaps a bit hesitant as to this choice. However, I believe this was a remarkably savvy political choice - as well as an effective way to renew American Catholics' interest in the Church."
The pope is a Yank.
folks he was born in america but he is a Peruvian and thank goodness :) maga already doing thier nut because he spoke in spanish and latin
No black pope. Surprised
"TRUMP has nothing in common with Vatican City, hes an evangelical."
Trump will ask him for a replacement
My God an American.Whats the world coming to.
Can't expect from any of them other than bending the truth just like the bent cross
"No ""religion "" controls me"
Is that trumps friend ?
We got an American pope before GTA VI
As they fail to elect Cardinal Tumi then i knew that there will never be a black Pope.
He'll make the Vatican Great Again!
Good. Maybe hell excommunicate trump and Biden
Doe's he sport a MAGA hat
"He was created by his parents, Francis had very little to do with it, for obvious reasons..."
"respectfully, that name looks cool"
I felt an Astronomer like Brother Guy Cosomagno (the Pope's Astronomer) should be elected Pope. He would have a good idea about just how microscopically tiny the Earth is within the Universe.
O gee I wish he was black.
69 years old nice
"How did president Trump get to know the next pope? No place in the world is free from rigging and influence peddling, iam afraid i must say!"
Christ is calling Americans back to him.
Habemus Papam
Good luck to Pope Leon XIV
"New Pope Robert Prevost is considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine."
Is it trump
Another priest who pushed the child abusing priests to another parish in peru . Robert prevost just another guy nothing special am so thankful I left the Catholic church in 2022
"Yay, one of Trumps besties as popewhat can possibly go wrong?"
"Hundreds of thousands of children are being abused and raped by Catholic priests and nuns. The Murphy report investigated widespread child abuse by priests in the Dublin archdiocese between 1975 and 2004. Thousands of infants died in Irish homes for unmarried mothersand babies run by the Catholic Church. 330,000 children abused and raped by nuns and 3000 priests in French churches. 20,000 children abused in Dutch churches. Nearly 5000 children abused in Portuguese churches. German churches are paying millions to 1800 abuse victims in Germany. More than 1000 children abused by more than 300 priests in Pennsylvania. Church of England has thousands of abuse cases. 7% of priests in Australia abused children. And the list goes on and on...."
"So Christianity is about to loose a lot of people over the next few years, becoz trust trumps policies are gonna make it up there"
American pope? The Catholic Church is finished. RIP.
"Dieu vous bnisse Saint Pre Lon 14,Amen"
congress
"Pope Jordan II , lets goooo !!"
Leo the Lion of God.
Niech yje papie! God bless you!
Congratulations from Bangladesh
Any bets on how long it will be before Trump claims credit for this?
First American Pope! History in the making
"No, Francis was first American Pope, Leo is the first North American Pope..."
Sod off. Ofc a trump supporter become the pope
Why are they cheering? The pope just died
I think Pope Bob is more appropriate.
Trump for Pope! this election is rigged! You have steal it!
Thank you Jesus for giving new Pope..
Behold the new clown..
Lets see how long it will take for the Orange Felon Dictator to take full credit on first American pope ...
"O my word , .... Lord come back quick and save us from the lunatics"
He was converted to Christianity !!
Another woke pope
'Merica!
Oh Happy days! I wonder how many little boys he has taken advantage of tho? It is a Catholic Church tradition from what Ive heard.
Humans rather pacify themselves with irrational beliefs rather than taking a hard journey to seek the truth.
"Only reason US Catholic priests are sent to South America is to hide a paedophile past, allowing further molestation of defenseless brown boys."
"American Pope!?! Did Trump threaten Tariffs on the Vatican? On the other hand, big grats Pope Prevost, Pope Leo XIV"
Politics is playing here why not African or Asian?
Im not Catholic.
BREAKING NEWS AN AMERICAN POPE LEO XIV
Viva il Papa
Trump: can we exchange for maybe a day?
Wonder how much money got placed into Cardinals offshore accounts.
Has Africa Catholics leaders ever got any pope before
The world is cooked
All hail the Supreme Pontiff!
New pope supposed be African man Arinze
Hopefully this American can take some airtime away from an another American.
": . . . . . . He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord. I kiss your hand, but I beg you to publish my comment so that people can see it. By God, our days and nights pass and we have nothing. Where are the merciful hearts? Our situation is difficult. Our situation is difficult. By God, I wrote these words only out of distress and cruelty. Circumstances, people, your hearts have become devoid of mercy, compassion and humanity. How much I have complained and cried, how much I have called and how much I have pleaded, but there is no life for those you call upon. Is it pleasing to you that my brothers are crying and dying of hunger while you are here? God knows that we do not have a kilo of flour. My father died and my brothers are young. We have no one. By God, they slept hungry yesterday, crying from pain and suffering. Oh good people, are you satisfied that we have been without food since yesterday? Oh brothers in Christ, oh benefactors, I swear on the Holy Book that I will not lie to you, I will not cheat, I will not cheat. I am a displaced Yemeni girl. My family and I have a monthly rent of 20,000 Yemeni riyals, and now we owe 60,000 for three months. The landlord is one of those people who have no mercy. By God, my brother, every day he comes to humiliate us and talk about us and wants to throw us out of the house into the street because we cannot pay him the rent. He does not leave until we cry and go back and tell the neighbors and give them a deadline until the end of the week. If we do not pay, he throws us out into the street without mercy. We are displaced from our country because of this war. We do not find our daily sustenance and we live with my mother and my young brothers and my father passed away, may God have mercy on him, and we have no one in the world to stand with us in these harsh circumstances and I do not have older brothers to stand with us in this and stand with us in these circumstances. My brothers are young and I am a girl and I do not know how to work. Some of my brothers went out to the street and saw and saw the neighbors eating, so they stopped and stood at their door to give them even a loaf of bread to satisfy their hunger. Some of us do not have anything and our situation is very difficult. They looked at us with an eye of mercy and threw them away and came back crying and dying of hunger. By God, we do not find a morsel of food and now if one of us does not help us with a kilo of flour, by God we will die of hunger. My brother, I rely on the Lord Jesus and then on you and I want your help so that he may hurry up and I ask you by Jesus Christ Jesus, who taught us mercy and cooperation between us. You love goodness and help me. If I ask for my card name and send it and do not delay, God will give you many times what you gave us. My brother, you are a man. If you see your family hungry, it is impossible to provide for them more, but my eyes are full and my hands are short. I do not have a father like you and my brothers are young. Look. Their condition and help us and save us before they throw us out into the street and humiliate us or we die of hunger. Let the Lord be a true and honest witness between us. I am not lying to you with a word in this message and I did not ask you except out of extreme distress and harsh circumstances and the situation that I and my family are in. We ask you in Christ Jesus if you have the ability, O good people, whoever has the ability to help us, do not delay for a moment. This is my number on WhatsApp 00967772168484. Whoever can help us, message me on WhatsApp and we will send him the name. May God reward you ith good.<<<<<<<<!.!.!<.<............{............<.......!!!!!,!......<.<.<.<<..<[[[[[..<.<..<.<..[.<.....%.^.^...>.>>.>.>..4...==.=.=...!.!.!......"
Trump got his wish!

USA is winning everywhere this year.
"Congratulations to His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV! May God grant him strength, wisdom, and divine grace in this sacred mission. May he be a true shepherd to the Churchguiding with love, leading with humility, and inspiring the world through faith and compassion."
He should help Trump implement his tariffs

Thank you for being transparent Mei. Her link is https://youtube.com/@bfxmauto
It is sad that we are in 2025 and people still value the services of the oligarchy.
Hahahaha they elected him because American Catholics have left the church for decades. They want American money
"What a load of lies. We are not to be praising ANY man. We are to ONLY praise Jesus the Christ, our Lord and Savior. HE is the truth, the way, and the life. No man goes to the Father but by Him! ALL praise to JESUS!!!"

"In 2000, Prevost allowed Father James Ray, an Augustinian priest, to reside at St. John Stone Friary in Chicago. Ray had been suspended from public ministry since 1991 due to credible accusations of abuse of minors. Although the priory was close to a Catholic elementary school, Prevost did not notify the school administration about Ray."
