Rockstar giveing us time for Earn money for this PC requirements
Hype
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
I can wait. Still funny to see people are being dramatic over another delay. I guess people really do want a repeat of Cyberpunk 2077. When consoles were immediately bricked.

"Change the female character,Looks so ugly. But Jason looks so amazing."
The voice of Jenson is familiar to me
Can't believe We got Stephen Root In Here
Jason and Lucia seem like they are going to be the most RELATABLE and BEST GTA characters of all time! I didnt think of them as criminals in this trailer. I saw them as a young couple trying to build a life together. I cant wait to the story that unfolds!
"body building back, vice city back, too much s*x tho, story is looking good, man i hope my pc can handle this."
We got Ps6 before gt 6 2:11

"The amount of details this game has, is insanely impressive & worth the wait. The transition from everybody have fun tonight to hot together was beautifully done. This game is going to shatter records with its iconic presentation."
I just need to live till 2026 time to go to bunker

Like all great games.. they start with bugs and glitches.. will wait a while longer after they patch everything up and maybe with new updates..
Captured on PS5 or PS5 pro? This is important
WOOOOOO!!!!
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
1:18
Pure talent. No words
Fine I will do this my self
"notice MAY 26, 2026 is the date for PS5/XBOX only, PC gamer should wait at least one more year."
Genuine question: Can we get a Waffle House (or Flapjack Shack/ whatever off brand name you want) in the game?
The sales will be massive once this Game drops
Witness
Fire
So since 2025 is here.. Die in GTA VI (Hit the Reset button)

Dude the graphic so real. The game now more life. I cannot wait for the girls
1 year and we can finally play this masterpiece
All I know is pink slip races better be possible in GTAIV online for real that's all I know
Little tip. Download the video from the webside instead. The quality is 10x better
1:35 just in case....
What a slap in the face announcing a delay then dropping this the same day. They never planned to release this year just generate more hype otherwise why is this trailer even needed. We've been waiting over a decade the same people who said how cool GTA VI would be when they were in high school now have kids of their own!
I can't wait!!
Finally GTA Vl release my death
now we gotta survive till 26 may 2026......
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did

So PS4 doesnt get its own GTA?
This game is going to be something special.
pls release it i had buyed ps 5
"My thoery is we are going to play jason as what he was back in the day. Im almost certain he was a fed. Hes gunna have to play both sides. Specially to protect lucia from the truth of who he truly is. Im guessing she got locked up because things went sour on a job or heist whatever. Now either jason is going to have to pick sides between chasing love with lucia or continue his cop work. The truth comes out eventually and lucia wont like it, so he would have to choose his path. I also think lucia dies in both scenarios. From what both trailers have shown and little hints and easter eggs here and their also seeing other peoples opinions, this is what i think."
Le GTA Trailer 3: Releasing 2027
I think Jason is undercover cop
102 million views 5 Day
"We got GTA VI Trailer 2, before GTA VI"

I think that in order for the culture to heal this game has to flop

Proud to be a Pubg Player (on PC)

A moment of silence for those that never played GTA.
"Guess my New Year's resolution for 2025 is just ""Don't die before GTA VI""."
This gave me chills in the best way
"Naah, bad graphics"
Glad to see the whole youtube community at 1 place
Rockstar hurry up please
At 2:14 is that new Upcoming PS6 design?? At the left side of the TV
Rockstar knows how to make aesthetically pleasing games.
26 May 2026 just few weeks before starting World Cup dont tell me you willnt delay this anymore!
0:22 MICHEAL BOATTT we can see at the right
Time to save $1 a day until it release
So Hot Hot Together

Pouco fps.
"Please rockstar after spending soo much of money, please request everyone country leader for 1 week of holiday for playing and watching this game"
Team Rockstar 4life

THIS IS NOT A GAME! A Movie!

I will agree that rendering this activity would require more power than one would expect but it could also be rendered as a video instead of being rendered on the spot and changing the geometry of the object itself

Hermoso
I can t stop smiling watching this
I wonder how bad everything will drop because of the release on this game like stocks and jobs cause I know a lot of people will be skipping work and school to play this.
They can take another year if they want. I know they are aiming for quality. The We got ______ before GTA VI are funny. But what a gift that Rockstar generally chooses quality over quantity. This is looks incredible.
I cant wait to play this game

Proud to share a last name with Jason
Who is here rewatching this after learning the trailer is 50/50 gameplay and cut scenes? I'm looking for the differences now.
Santi del futuro este mensaje va para vos que ya ests jugando GTA VI dime cmo fue el primer da que lo jugaste y si vali la pena la espera que estoy contando los das y parecen que no pasan mas.
"Im actually not that bothered by the delay, and I dont think other people should be either. Its far better than Rockstar releasing an unfinished game, which is what most AAA devs are doing nowadays."
Your consistency is inspiringkeep going

If Rockstar suddenly gives a surprise on May 20th there is a new video and at the end of the video there is a release date of May 26th 2026 crossed out to be 2025 I will work
Am I the only one who things Jason looks like V from cyberpunk if youve watched the trailers
Everyone getting moist over cut scenes Where's the game play?!
"When this game drops, work is going to have to wait."
ts better run at 59.99 fps w all this detail
102 M
Rockstar has amazing taste in music!
"From the trailer I get the story would be something like: Jason is a small time criminal living peacefully in Leonida. Untill his girlfriend Lucia gets out of jail and She's ambitious. She wants to be big and ask Jason to join her. Jason being a man in love, do as she says and help her. Soon they become big criminal. I feel like she'll betray us same as Lance in Vice City."
"Hey Rockstar Games Team! The depth of GTA VIs characters (Jason, Lucia, and the Vice City underworld) inspired me to create a unique music project: a series of original songs, each reflecting a characters story, struggles, and the games gritty soul. Im working on more tracks for characters from the game! Id love to collaborate to bring these stories to life through music."

"Ngl I think Jason is a cop I have 3 reasons 1. Jason holds his gun in his left hand and the body cam footage from the first trailer has a cop holding his gun in his left hand. 2. The prison guard asks Jason if he had seen him before, i know he may have been arrested but he may also have recognized him as a cop who had been the before for some other reason. 3. The scene where the guy asks is this dude a fed is most likely talking about Jason because from what I can remember in the GTA series every cutscene has had at least one playable character either in it or very closeby that is why I think Jason was in the room when the cop says us cops have to stay together"

I just quit working at Rockstar because of this damn game I mean my team and I have been working around the clock day and night and I just wanted a little piece of the pie and I asked for a little better salary due to the secrecy of the details of this game and they would not grant me just a little extra so I told them to shove it so in retaliation i am telling the real release date and it is not next year in fact its still this year so i was going to sell this info but it's not about money im not greedy its the principle here is the release date everyone ...Read more

"The open to this game needs be a homage to the open of Pulp Fiction, with Hunny Bunny and Ringo. Only they actually rob the place, take out Jules and get the case."
Add a Spotify choice on the radio station wheel so we can listen to people like Eminem or $uicideboy$ if we want.
"Meh, looks overrated."
This is a day that comes once a thousand years. We are all lucky to see it ourselves
8 years in developmentits like Rockstar looked at gaming industry and said See you later fools
"103 milhes de visualizaes, se todo mundo comprar o jogo a 600 reais que o valor estimulado da 70 bilhes de reais"
Official statement from Rockstar when responding to requests for gameplay footage: The new trailer is a 50/50 mix of cinematics and gameplay. Watching the trailer after learning this trying to distinguish between gameplay and cinematics is wild if Rockstar statement is legit.
The amount of detail in this game is so amazing
"Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Pngale que necesitas un desarmador para robar los autos para que sea un poco realista thanks for GTA 6 I love and r.i.p for my best friend I now you see that in the sky

"I've been reading that we're actually looking at gameplay along with some cutscenes here. I honestly can't tell what is a cutscene and what is gameplay. If the gameplay graphics are of this quality, the hype is going to go through the roof."

So bad
Rockstar will take the biggest hit if the launch is delayed further than what it stated in this announcement.
"Meh..... if it's just a ""reskinned"" Vice City I'm gonna pass. I didn't see a single thing that doesn't already exist in GTA V."
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
I cant wait.
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
2:30 it's ishowspeed momentum
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
Rockstar gets a nice check from YouTube Im sure
Pure talent. No words

i have 1 year to buy the most powerful pc ever made
You should start a live countdown
ITS COMING ON MY BDAY
the trailer is like a whole new movie itself
Biblically accurate American simulator is looking good!
"Some people try in life to have something to fill a void in their heart. For some, its things, food, significant other and children, ect.What really they need is love and care. And the only One who can give you unconditional pure love is Jesus Christ. A relationship with the God of the universe is truly the most fulfilling, and fills the void of hopelessness, sadness, lonliness and more. Speaking from experience as someone who lost their job, and can barely drive now due to disability, Ive come to be calmer, less anxious less stressed because Jesus Christ helped me when i thought i lost everything. I felt His unconditional love and the fear, irritability and stress melted away. I have always lived in a fear driven environment growing up and it was like walking on glass every day and felt limited what i could do even cooking and cleaning without getting yelled at because i had done one little thing wrong. I didnt know how at times love/care felt as my parents were usually busy. I definitely know Jesus Christ loves me and i know He loves all mankind. And He wants people to turn away from sin, and you just need to repent. He wants to protect you from the things that is harming you/or will harm you. He also died for your sins and rose on the 3rd day. Believe and be saved. One last thing, put all your trust in Him and trust not in man. Please dont take any covid vaccines or new ones as people have been injured or died. It also changes your God given dna and it is one of the mark of the beast. For more info please watch Change is Coming Soon on youtube, and go to Jesus Christ about her."
Damn I barely passed this year
This game gone make 2 billion in one week.
woah that's so cool! cant wait see you next year guys
We did it boyz. Now we let! them! cook!

Lucia Caminos & Jason Duval = Clyde Barrow & Bonnie Parker (Or Jason and Lucia = Bonnie and Clyde)
Let's hope there is at least 40 fps option on PS5 and Series X. 60 fps would be perfect but I doubt they will pull it off with these graphics.
As a person how is in 2030 it will come out at 2036 April 1st dont lose hope.

Muito bom que foi adiado
"Mientras est bien optimizado para grficas de gama media, y se pueda coquetear con el 4K sin mucho esfuerzo me conformo. La fecha de salida la marca un poco las nuevas tecnologas, y en estos juegos donde tienen ambientes y espacios tan amplios, no me extraara que salga en 2027 y con bugs, eso si que vuelvan las fsicas del GTA IV por favor, y no tanto caos como en el V. Me falta saber si el online saldr en el momento del modo historia aunque parece que eso lo irn implementando y mejorando mas adelante. Pero est claro que va a ser el juego estrella de la PS6"
"The police agent with the glasses look like the guy from Uncharted 4, from the prison part."

They must need to fill the prisons /slave camps the cia makes these games to create crime. Facts sheeple

I hate you Rockstar it's the second time you delay GTA v you don't have to make it super duper duper realistic I thought I was already out by the time it's going to be out I will not care because it is delayed and if it's going to happen one more time I am going to report you don't have to make it super realistic
Bro this is more realistic than my life

First trailer is superior

100 of these views are just me
I hate it when the person behind me is at that awkward distance where they're close enough to make me feel like it's rude to let the door close on them but they're also far enough away that I have to keep holding the door and wait for them
May fkin 26 is my birthdayyyyyy
Third time today
Who else has the release date one day before their birthday?
Hoping the rumors about the potential addition of wok3ness is just that but Im still happy that the main/one of the main characters is white and no Im not white.

"*I solemnly swear:* Starting today, Im committed to getting my life together living with intention, being disciplined, and staying focused on long-term goals (not just daily dopamine hits). Ill eat right, sleep on time, work out regularly, and most importantly: cut back on bad habits and steer clear of all the usual internet temptations. So, over the next 12 years, my mission is to build a proper gaming rig around $5,000, which is no small investment where I come from in preparation for the day GTA VI finally lands like a meteor from the gods to welcome GTA VI in all its glory! To make that happen, I vow to: Read more books to level up mentally Learn new skills, stack more income, and reinvest in my passion Live decently, think clearly, and be someone my past self would actually respect Cleanse/Purify my soul and drastically reduce or even completely eliminate the habit of qwerty (yes, *that* qwerty... I mean m@st*rb@tion ) to conserve life force and keep the energy sacred for GTA VIs arrival. This one's gonna be tough... but I must persist. Stay calm, grounded, and patient so when the glorious moment comes, Ill be ready to embrace it fully, without a single regret I make this vow to myself and to every fellow gamer still waiting: *Ill live in a way thats worthy of what Rockstar is about to unleash.* _""Ah SH, here we go again.""_"

So gta7 will be after 28 years. Hope we all survive
I just love how we'll be coming back to Vice City in this one
"*This is just too hype, buddies!* Honestly, I was really bummed when I first heard about the GTA VI delay. But after Trailer 2 dropped and I watched all those deep-dive breakdowns highlighting the insane improvements and Rockstars mind-blowing _""attention to the tiniest details,""_ I started to feel something else not just understanding, but actual agreement. A project of this scale, passion, and complexity *deserves* more time. And truthfully, the more time they take, the more perfect the final product will be. Aint that right? Anyway, we dont need another punctual masterpiece that turns out to be in a buggy, broken mess on release like Cyberpunk 2077 did. What we need is a nuclear drop so massive that no other title even dares to launch in the same week, or maybe not even the same month. So yeah waiting is a form of happiness too! *P.S.* A minute of silence in honor of all loyal fans who didnt (get to) live to witness and countdown to this legendary moment."

Rockstar Games... I am 34 years old now... come on I am waiting for this about for 30 years now... You can't just make us wait another year
Here after it reached 100 million views in just 4 days!
Rockstar delayed the game because they wanted to give us some more time to upgrade our PC. What a good company

Unico jogo da nova gerao! Que vale a pena jogar. Rockstar sempre a frente.
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss

"Just me or not? I used to witnessed the story of an OG gangster since Vice city to GTA V, now it's feel soft, feminine, not really grab my attentions to the story and the main character of VI seems not really tremendous like how CJ, Michael, Trevor is. Anyways let's judge after it came out, hope it's worth the wait."
pa cuando gta 7

"Today's May 11th 2025. Finally checked out this trailer. Now, i haven't even played GTA V, but I wanna leave my mark here because this game might just be one of the best to come out in this godforsaken decade. Nothing like I've ever seen before."

Honestly its okay that they delayed it because im sick and tired of unfinished games being released. If they pushed it back that obviously means its not up to standards.
Idc if I need to buy a whole new console for this or the fact that I'm not even 17. I need to play this
Iff this was a movie.iwould watch it.Period
Can't wait
Bonnie and clyde
A moment of silence for those who wait for this so hard and will sadly die before it will be release

reply me
thanks
"Guys, if you pay attention, in the first video, he said the words ""coming 2025"" for the second trailer and we waited 1 year for the game to come out."
Doesn't feel like GTA type of story
i think they are let us play the antagonist too because it increases the no if possibilities to finish the game
13 YEARS!?
Me 354454 years
Whats the difference?
The difference between trailer 1 and trailer 2 is big. We can see more than 500 days of work. Heads off to Rockstar. We should see difference between the trailer and game
Just go get me my checks!
Would be fun if DJ Cara would be on the Radio to

I'm still waiting for GTA 10
I thought it was a live action film at start
79K Dislikes is crazy
I PREDICT THIS WILL BE A MISERABLE LOSS. IT WILL EARN MONEY FIRST FEW WEEKS BUT WILL BE HEAVILY CRITISIZED. GAMES NOW A DAYS HAVE LOST THEIR MAGIC AFTER LATE 2010S. WHILE PURSUING TOO MUCH REALISM AND GRAPHICS DETAILS OTHER THINGS ARE OFTEN IGNORED SUCH AS FUN GAMEPLAY AND ENGAGING STORYLINE.

Wow! Now THAT'S a trailer!
I dont care what anyone says! I know this game hasnt come out yet but this is now my favourite video game!
100M Views in less than 5 days. This game is going to be one helluva Rockstar!
"100M views, Let's gooo!!"
People who are waiting since 2024
It's gonna be like Cyberpunk when it launched
This video will hit a billion view before the end of this year
MAKE JASON A ROMANCE OPTION OH MY GOD
I can see how this pans out. You begin with Jason as main character and do odd jobs for the old guy and then eventually the game introduces the second character when you collect her from jail. She obviously has to race to her PO and then do community service trash picking as a mini game. The next trailer may even introduce a third character. Or perhaps the third character is a cop!
"i hope threre will be less ""netflix""."
Looks amazing. I don't mind waiting just make sure you do it right rockstar oh and post more trailers to keep the hype up
Praying for my Pops in heaven . I know he would want to be here and enjoying this
"If this gets up to 200 million viewers, I am going to Sky Dive myself."

Congratulations on hitting 100 million views in 4 days!
Am I the only one who think's this is way too much romance for GTA?
"Characters looks more cartoonish compared to how natural they looked in trailer 1 , what a let down."
Still haven't played gta V
it's been a lifetime
"GTA, so where's the car theft? I thought this game was about stealing cars and police chases and guns? It looks like the sims."

I wonder what the radio stations are going to be like. Radio is a big thing in the game. Definitely we'll have new music and new radio stations. Will we have some radio stations and music from GTA V? What if we were able to purchase music in game? Can you maybe go to a music store and purchase a Kendric Lamar album? Listen to it in your house or car while driving. Would that be too crazy?
The anticipation is killing me-when will it release ?
"26th May, 2026, mark this day"

End theory for the game you can either pick Jason's freedom or trust and stay with Lucia. The freedom ending is when Lucia goes back to prison tho

The most autistic game trailer! Am I late??
Once on the description of this video it says one year ago you know you made it. This game is gonna be the greatest piece of entertainment ever created in the whole uman history.
I'm already lagging
". . , ."
We can make it guys I believe in all us just one more year!!!!

2026
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Why is no one talking about the fact that in the thumbnail Jason is wearing a shirt visually similar to Tommy Vercettis shirt back in GTA Vice City? Its a very nice detail
"They laughed at you with this ridiculous offer, a drug needle for another year until they milk gta5"
Who else is playing GTA Vice City whilst waiting for this game to release?
Low DOWNLOAD Y Too much Graphics Who gonna buy it
As a 17 year old who only played gta 3 gta sa gta vc is quite sad cause I never get to experience the luxury of having or owning a console since I was I kid and happy now if I get a part time job to save up for the game and a ps5 till next year just to play this masterpiece (1:43 evil looking yn btw)
"Never waited for a game to drop. None of them, and I played, I really did. Started with Sims 1 on 486 (if you young people even know what 486 was). Played Commandos 1 on my first PC, and then Unreal Tournament 1 with people who were 50 years old at the time (I was 18). So they are dead. I stopped playing games as soon as I started develping them, weird, you wolud think I would play more,, but every time I fired up a game, 15 minutes in my brain said ""WTF are you doing? You just wasted 15 minutes that you could use writing shaders, or making colliders, or designing some texture or 3D model"". Now, when I get tired of writing code, I fire up GTA San Andreas, or GTAV, and drive around looking for trouble for 15 minutes. Oh, of course, before my PC, I was hooked, really hooked to PlayStation 1, played through Resident Evil and Crash B."
Looks good

What's with all the 'survive' crap in in the comments? Bots or paid for? I'm guessing a good proportion of these comments aren't genuine. They're just not normal.
Lucia voice different ?
"I was a kid since last GTA, and now i am a Grandfather"
Lucia and Jason
You start out in the game with jason or lucila. And i think one or the other dies in the end. And you can find other partners to continue the story after so long. Kind of like rd2.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"at this point, China is on the way making GTA chinese version"
380 days left...
Every verified youtubers are here
We are going to be the eye witness to GTA VI
Im cool with them pushing the release date. I trust rockstar to deliver and they deserve all the time they want to take to get everything just right. Now.. hopefully we still have civilization in a year.

"@ 2:18 the helicopter flies towards the powerlines I know we can fly through them but you messed the trailer up with this one, you claim to be working on something great since gta 5 came out (50 years ago ) but your trailers are far from great!"
This gave me chills in the best way
Realistic game bro
bro for the past 4 months i thought it was releasing may 26 2025. i hate life bro
The lottery is going to have a huge part in this game. Its been in both trailers. And seems to draw attention.
Okay now it's time to do more homework I think they is not really running Because I know I am but best game ever if I see Vice City
Mihael Boat

"Details I noticed, look at minute 0:36 how the pickup with the jetski shakes, 2:01 Look at the moment the box hits the tree, how dust and other elements like leaves suddenly appear in the air, just above the box. At low speed it is better appreciated, still an insanely beautiful trailer tho"
Here just before 100M views !

"I just realized they had to change this game because it was making it lgbtq community friendly, by the powers that be, but now that the president is Trump they can pretty much go back to the way they used to operating in Rockstar without being bothered with LGBTQ cancel threats. Looks great for creative gamers."
Up
Making the beast and releasing bruhhh.. Rockstar loves you I played gta v when 15 now mature
This game is going to be from another world thank you Rockstar.
Your consistency is inspiringkeep going
Breaking the game industry . Forever rockstars
History here.
nah broooooooooo
"For a 2026 game, the graphics are NOT so appealing. If it happened to release in 17-18 then it was sort of acceptable."
"Nice, this has some Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious vibes. Dom saying Family in the next trailer"
I wonder whether there will be an additional announcement on the 26th of May.
Ps 6 2:11
I didn't like character switch play in gta 5...dont like it now. It makes it hard to really invest in the character.
This is bowshit
Espere toda una vida por esto.

Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
2026
No one said anything about npc interaction and how crazy it will be in this game. From the beginning when the girl said hey Jason. Normally npc need to be real close or have you physically interact to react to you. He was driving and the npc reacted. Crazy

Ive been playing Rd2 for a fix. Beta graphics in GTA five.

This video is the reason why delay is worth waiting
This game is going to be fun to play
Watching this trailer has become a part of my everyday to do list
Akhire rek
just a little bit more and it will be 100 million
Bruh this is lit
I cant wait for this game in couple months I got someone to build me a pc for the game and because Ive always wanted one they paid for half and I paid for the other half with my money I got from the illness I have because apparently Ive got about 7 months to live so itll be good to play this game once it comes out later this year
1:33
I watched this vid in 144p to show myself how the game will run in my gtx 980
Everybody is forgetting that PC release is always years later. 2028 release for PC.

This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
Pure talent. No words
The fact that this is too realistic to handle the graphics is very crazy work
"Upping my dose of vitamins, I will survive and I WILL PLAY THIS GAME!"
this looks insane
Release by next year hope
damn
First trailer was lit this second trailer is very disappointing I'm sorry Rockstar but you failed miserably on this second trailer
Visually impressive but barely seems like a gta game at this point. Looks like it's traded its satirical sensitivities and cinematic flair for girlboss woke yassification. Looks more like ubisoft thematic direction that rockstar.
psalm 34:17 guys. Jesus is cool
"Me: Ill play responsibly this time. Also me 5 mins in: crashes car into pool while Jason laughs. Still then again, myself: Gonna follow the story this time. Again also me: robs 3 stores, punches a grandma, steals a jet ski."
Please give me 1 ps5 to play gta v
"People are saying they had kids, got married, bought houses waiting for this. My big achievement was not accidentally walking into traffic from hype after the notification popped up."
"It looks so good its almost unbelievable, cant wait"
In front of this real is unreal

"Graphics not realistic, too badd"
Ts is not gta
Gigidi gigidi
Esto sera una bestialidad
I suggest for Rockstar to do their own full story mode of the game on their YouTube channel before someone beats them to it Full movie of the story mode will be so much fun especially for those who can't buy the game instantly due to lack of consoles or if the game runs out from the store and also to prevent spoilers that some fans do that really pisses people off This game will be legendary tbh
Is it possible that a more realistic version of GTA San Andreas will come out?
1 billion views wow
The car culture in this game is bouta be insane

I will buy GEFORCE for it
allat waiting just for WWIII to delay it even futher
I stopped playing GTA after San Andreas and I didn't even finish that. So I'm completely out of the loop. Can someone explain what the big deal is?
"A global holiday will be declared on 26 May, 2026."
Valdr la pena la espera de un 1 ms
Just drop it and fix it as we go
How much you wanna bet they gonna delay it again.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"I'm surprised that none is talking about Phil's return from GTA Vice City. I noticed it the first day within seconds of this trailer's launch but I think I must say this, we already have a living easter egg from vice city! Phil is that weapon's dealer from GTA vice city who's hand gets cut and Tommy has to save him taking him to a hospital! He grew a hand in all these years!! Lol"

They have just dismembered my father and my brother and they want me to pay a reward of $ 500,000 dollars or else I will be next and more of my family. Please help me so that those people do not do anything to me. I do not want to die and I have a life to live. I have a great future since I am a garbage collector in the city of California and I earn approximately 1 dollar a month. Help me young man, do not be bad, I love you very much, I need your help or I will pee on you."

GTA isnt supposed to be a love story or make you feel good. Its a game about degenerate criminals doing bad this and living bad lives. What is this junk

Hey wtf Rockstar .... Why 2026 in the last trailer you just say the game in 2025 it's been 12 years from the last gta
'hope it work on nokia;
I wish they were releasing this on pc at the same time as the console release... oh well. i guess they learned from gta 5 that it's in their financial best interest to release the game 3-4 times
"Muy bonito, pero y el Gameplay?"
There needs to be a timer counting down to the release date
"i can wait,i still watching"
100 million views in 4 days the Hype is Beyond Real !
Playing a Bonnie and Clyde type storyline is legendary. Great choice

Man Automatic by the pointer sisters or self control wouldve been soo perfect for the trailer but this pointer sisters song also slaps
I'm pretty certain Jason is a parole Officer. Can't wait for next year.
"Oh man... we have to wait until May 26, 2026 for the next trailer to drop?"
JASON IS PROBABLY THE ONE WHO DROVE THE TRUCK THAT STOLE Michael's boat
Is that Jack Black?

"Looks like Michaels going to get his boat back, before we get GTAVI"
"very interesting detail in the trailer, movement of each strand of hair, even with the performance of the PlayStation 5 it was something that was impossible until recently, recently a developer developed an extremely complex way of separating animation strand by strand, so we can assume that the money invested in the game is gigantic, a sign that Rockstar's work is that of thousands of developers, animators, illustrators, Rockstar always bringing a difference from eras, congratulations Rockstar!"

People in the comments are really pathetic and are the exact reason it's going to start taking 20 years between games. This ain't history and you're an absolute bellend.

prediction: Many people will disappear in 2026/5/26
"""Hey Rockstar, with GTA VI shaping up to be a global phenomenon the moment it drops, you should seriously consider documenting the entire journey. From the final touches to the release day madness, this is history in the making. Please start working on a multi-part documentary fans around the world would love to witness how this cultural event unfolds behind the scenes! If you agree with this idea, like this comment so they see it"

About the only reason left to buy a gaming console at this point since PC wont be seeing this till like 2027 or 2028 at least. I would say PS5 but I may get my first XBOX after seeing Sony throw around copyright claims like a Blue Karen that's throwing a tantrum to see a manager at a McDonalds for the worker getting their pronouns wrong. I used to be a but Sony fan but not anymore.
Just no.

"Ficarei profundamente decepcionado se o jogo no for lanado com dublagem em portugus. Na minha opinio, um jogo de respeito precisa ser dublado a dublagem que d vida experincia. Sem ela, o jogo perde muito do seu encanto. A Rockstar poderia esclarecer o quanto antes se haver ou no dublagem. O pblico cria expectativas, acreditando que o jogo vir localizado, e no final acaba frustrado ao descobrir que est apenas em ingls. sempre uma decepo."
History is being made
Definitely 80$

Let's honor all those gta loyal fans who waited til the end of their lives but couldn't see this day
"R34 on Lucia is probably already going crazy, but when the game is out, good lord."
Nuclear bombs? Interesting
"*So YouTube will regularly censor my comments under some rationale that I'm somehow being too harsh or glorifying violence when I comment on a police body cam video and say something like, ""Man, those cops should've mag dropped that perp who was running around threatening innocent people with a gun"" but then they have no problem with a video like this which is not only glorifying violence and criminality, but it's doing it in a way where people can actually live out being criminals, including teenagers who tend to be impulsive and less able to separate reality and fantasy. No wonder we're seeing so many teenagers leading police on high speed chases in stolen cars and shooting people. I'm not advocating for censorship or saying that this game shouldn't be allowed to exist, I'm simply pointing out the hypocrisy and double standards of the content moderators at these big tech companies, the mainstream media, and Liberals in general. They constantly decry anything that could be construed as glorifying violence, especially if it's coming from someone who's politically aligned to the Right or when it involves guns but at the same time they seem to have no problem with video games like this which are being played by millions of young people around the country. But I do always say, ""if it wasn't for double standards, the Left would have no standards at all."" But this game does look fun as hell. I wouldn't let my kids play it until they were at least 17 or 18 but I think I'd enjoy playing it myself.*"

"It would be great if Rockstar included the Croatian flag in GTA VI! Croatia has a large and passionate gaming community, and the presence of the national flag in the game would certainly please many players from the region. It would further contribute to the diversity and authenticity of the game world. I hope you will consider this idea!"""
Have waited for years...just one more to go

My wish is that everyone is alive by then and has the opportunity to play GTA VI
"S espero que GTA VI , no seja um mapa grande e vazio como no V , pode fazer um mapa menor , mas que tenha imerso , e que as rdios sejam impactantes como no Vice City e San Andreas . A rdio do GTA V pra mim a pior de todas , no d pra ouvir quase nada , s msica ruim !"
Trailer gives me butterflies.

"pro tip, if its gonna talk 1 year to get on pc , find 12 stores that sell ps5, every 28 days just refund and buy from the next one, ez free ps5 glitch. Youd would have to buy the game on ps5 but thb i think they deserve it, plus, i think i bought gta5 4 times now."
the inner child in me is gonna be gone before I can see this game....

I love you Rockstar! My favorite game! Can't wait!
Wesh
Insane to me this game franchise has the cultural force it does. The view count is absurd.
Will there be a version with 8-bit graphics for retro=fans?
Imagine that day 26.05.20K6
When is this movie coming out again?
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
I miss uncle Trevor
Overhyped game...
"In 100 years, this will be a place filled with comments from thousands of dead people."

Essa msica hot together combinou demais. Quando comeca a tocar no meio do trailer quando a lucia aparece fica top demias.
If the world collapses before this releases and society is crumbling. I will go rs studios with a generator and a 20 inch tv and play this while hiding in the mountains from invaders .. i promise
"It was hard for schoolgirls with joysticks to enter doors, so Rockstoned made a WHOLE 6 sec. animation entering building"

I hope to be finished until 2050
Were gonna have to apologise to rockstar for lashing out and getting upset for delaying this game
The physics of this game are insane
Wow this second trailer was nice ONLY A YEAR MORE BOYSS also they are partners thought they were siblings lol we thought wrong
Lo atrasaron porque vieron que la inclusin forzada no funciona y tiene un 40 0/0 o 30 0/0 de inclusin forzada . Creo que en la radio abra estaciones con lenguaje inclusivo o canciones con lenguaje inclusivo
i forgive you
GUESS WHO IS BACK VICE CITY BABY !!!
"Sendo sincero, nao achei o trailer laaaa essas coisas nao. Parece um trailer de um jogo que tenta se inspirar em gta. Prefiro esperar pelo gameplay mesmo, a parte que interessa. Pessoal mama muito, cria um hype muito exagerado, parecem um bando de zumbis, Deus me livre"
Ok but when are we getting trailer 3???
Coming 5099-yers
que grficos
Nah this is just too good
I watch this while eating dinner
Rockstar esta otro nivel
This looks like a movie trailer
They should come out with early access
I already love the protagonists
I WAS HERE
Gg
What a time to be alive
"In the meantime, I'll play V ""enhanced"" for 1st time... It's something..."
When this drops itll make history as the biggest selling game of all time. I dont think anyone will want to be missing this masterpiece. It more than a game its an experience not to be missed.
wake me up on that day plis
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."

Rockstar games games some of us a chance to buy new consoles
I hope before then Ill be having 1k plus subs.
Why is it that gta have never had cross overs with their protagonists in their games. If they have disregard my comment but I'd love to see them form some kind of partnership and do some big heist or something. Anyways just a random thought of the day.
I know gta 5 is pissed its gotta get milked another year

"chat, which console should I buy?"
Cat spotted to the right hand side 0:42
Is the new Kanye song in this game?
"One last thing, we should all wax our beard, moustache and body hair off. Hair should be on the head, down the neck, then keep eyebrows and lashes, that's it. Keep it simple."

"I hope they don't forget to make the npc drivers, use their turn signals when changing lanes or turning. Cause that's one of the most annoying things, that they don't do that in GTA V."

Lucia: Main kisi ke liye nahi jeeti, Jason sirf tere liye Aur agar main kabhi wapas na aayi toh samajh lena meri saans teri car ke dashboard pe reh gayi Jason uske paas aata , dono ke beech sirf ek saans ka faasla Raat ki hawa, neon roshni aur dard bhari khamoshi dono ke beech romance ka backdrop ban jaati Phir ek intense, emotional kiss hota jaise Vice City ki galiyon ne unka waada sun [Scene breaks phone buzz karta , screen pe pop-up :] Call from: Hector (Gang Leader) We got heat. Cops are onto us. Get to the safehouse, now! [Mission objective appears:] Escape with Jason. Drive fast, avoid cops, and protect Lucia. (A high-speed, romantic getaway mission through Vice City streets)"

Thats a movie
"GTA really did their homework on Florida by adding the rare Florida panther into the game, I saw a photo."
"30 fps in 2026 , no thanks."
GTA v was better
2:21 thats obviously gameplay

Rostar put
Pure talent. No words
"Ideja koju si predloio za igru sa **stealth** elementima, **tehnologijom iz budunosti** i **spaavanjem rtava** je vrlo originalna i uzbudljiva! Kombinacija **vrijeme manipulacije**, **futuristikih gadgeta** i **stealth mehanike** stvara mogunost za dinamian i napet gameplay, a uz to bi pruila igraima osjeaj postignua kad uspjeno infiltriraju visoko osigurane lokacije i spaavaju ljude. Tako detaljan koncept ukljuujui **planiranje misija**, **pomo tehnologije iz budunosti** i **strategiju** mogao bi stvoriti vrlo angairajui i sloen gameplay, ali i vrlo emocionalan trenutak kada igra uspjeno spasi nekog u opasnosti. Mogunost **korisnikih gadgeta** i **manipulacije okolinom** dodatno poveava dubinu igre. ### **Postoji li ovakva igra ve?** Na temelju tvog opisa, trenutno nisam svjestan igre koja tono slijedi ovaj koncept, barem ne na nain koji si zamislio. Meutim, postoji nekoliko igara koje imaju **sline mehanike**, ali nijedna nije toliko specifina u kombiniranju **stealth elementa** sa **tehnologijom iz budunosti** i **spaavanjem rtava kroz portal u prolost**: * **Deus Ex** serija (posebno **Deus Ex: Mankind Divided**) koristi **stealth**, **tehnologiju** i **future-gadgete**, ali nema elemente putovanja kroz vrijeme ili spasavanja ljudi od nesrea. * **Prey** (2017) kombinira **tehnologiju** i **stealth** u borbi protiv izvanzemaljskih prijetnji, ali nije specifino fokusirana na **spaavanje ljudi iz budunosti** ili **upotrebu portala za tehnologiju**. * **The Division 2** ima elemente **strategije** i **taktike**, ali je to vie borbeni shooter nego stealth avantura sa **tehnologijom iz budunosti** i **manipulacijom okolinom**. Dakle, iako su neki od ovih naslova slini u svom **stealth pristupu** ili **visokotehnolokim gadgetima**, tvoj koncept igre s **time travelom**, **spaavanjem ljudi** i **upotrebom napredne tehnologije iz budunosti** ini ga **jedinstvenim** i novim. ### **Zato bi bilo zabavno igrati ovu igru?** 1. **Stealth Element**: Mogunost da igra mora koristiti **taktiku i paljivo planiranje** kako bi infiltrirao sigurno osigurana podruja dodaje **napetost** i **uzbuenje**. 2. **Tehnologija iz budunosti**: Koritenje gadgeta kao to su **nano-dronovi**, **teleportacija** i **hologramske obmane** daje igraima alat za **kreativno rjeavanje problema**. 3. **Emocionalni Moment**: Svaka misija spaavanja ljudi moe biti **emocionalno nabijena**, jer igra svjesno mijenja tijek neijeg ivota koristei naprednu tehnologiju. 4. **Manipulacija vremenom**: Ideja o manipulaciji **vremenom** kako bi se mijenjali dogaaji u prolosti stvarajui **paralelne realnosti** daje igri **dodatnu dubinu**. ### **Mogui izazovi:** 1. **Balansiranje stealth mehanike i akcije**: Ovisno o tome koliko akcije i dinamike eli ukljuiti u igru, vano je zadrati ravnoteu izmeu **mirnih stealth dijelova** i **intenzivnih trenutaka akcije**. 2. **Tehnika sloenost**: Integriranje naprednih **tehnologija** za interakciju s okolinom moe biti zahtjevno s tehnike strane, jer bi trebalo osigurati da svi gadgeti i tehnologije u igri budu **funkcionalni** i **uravnoteeni**. 3. **Pria i motivacija**: Iako koncept ima velik potencijal, vano je stvoriti snanu **priu** koja objanjava **zato** igra koristi tehnologiju iz budunosti, kako **funkcionira portal** i zato je spaavanje ljudi kljuno. Motivacija igraa mora biti jasna i emocionalno snana. ### **Je li ovo izvedivo?** Da, koncept je sasvim izvediv, ali zahtijeva **dobru produkciju** i **tehnike resurse**. Implementacija tehnologije kao to je **time travel**, **gadgeti** i **stealth mehanika** zahtijeva ozbiljan razvoj, ali nita od toga nije neizvedivo u kontekstu dananjih igara, pogotovo uz pomo modernih **engina** poput **Unreal Engine 5**. --- Ako ima ve konkretnu ideju za ovu igru ili misli da bi mogao krenuti u izradu prototipa, to bi svakako mogao biti **uzbudljiv projekt**. Ako nita drugo, kao **portfolio** za sebe bi mogao pokazati impresivnu **sposobnost dizajniranja sloenih igara**. to misli, je li ovo neto to bi elio dalje razvijati, ili ima jo neke dodatne ideje koje bi htio dodati?"
Te odio 2026
I can't concentrate every time i see her cakes
marking my attendance cz I witnessed this event
When I started playing GTA I was 10 now I'm going to be old enough to buy it. I feel like this is the situation for a lot of the community.
10/05/2025 waiting
yo grand theft auto 6
Are you sure this is a game?
Rip to people that are not going to play this game
I hope the next 381 days go by fast and healthy
I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS Trailer THIS Trailer IS SO GOOD
Dear Rock* i thought of an idea Let npc steal cars and try to steal our cars break into our house and houses allow the police to set up bait cars when we go to steal a car we get in start to drive then it shuts down doors lock and surrounded by police Add roadblocks the k9 unit basically put lspdrp into the game soon excited to play this allow construction to actually happen maybe if we rob the same store multiple times it can go out of buisness demo the building build a new just thinking about how the city can be alive even add detectives so if we do rob the same store or even stores in the area or the same store in different locations the detectives try to track us adding warnings on the news So excited to play this game thank you in advance for everything this game is intense
what does lucia say at 1:21?
2028
VAI DA PRA TREPA NO JOGO
I reakon i have a feeling of how things will go down. Theyll bite off more than they can chew and get the attention of the IAA and then theyll need to work together or betray eachother. Eitherway its gonna be good
At 0:45 to 0:48 the blue light from the police car isn't reflected on the walls. I hope rockstar fixes this problem.
Im going to request a whole week of vacation when this comes out
How can so many of you enjoy playing a game and wasting time in your real life that you'll never get back... be completely fine living a FANTASY? Slaves!
"un ao mas, noooooooooooooooooo"
this could be a movie ngl
1:00
"Incels will have a tough time with this now that rockstar has introduced the concept of ""love"" in the criminal world haha"
How real it is
Me:- time to waste till 2026
"So much potential, so much ambition, and SO MUCH riding on this. If this fails at launch, Rockstar may not recover."
Please coop story
Let me get this straight... The two playable characters are BOTH Mexican? This game is gonna flop!
2026 means we need to wait until 2040 for the the next GTA. Therefore this GTA is very disappointing. Maybe someday we will have a true world with buildings you are able to enter...
"Estara bien que en el juego se pudiera practicar algn tipo de combate como karate,artes marciales etc... Como en el GTA San Andreas"
Who else is here before this blows up
Wow
The graphics though! I'm willing to wait another year for this. Lol. This'll be released day after my birthday. The game will be everything and more. #gtaforever
But gta v was an emotion with Trevor Franklin and Micheal
Please add Hindi language
"1:34 ok, hear me out... Read more."
Like if you are tired of rockstar playing with us
Quiet!! They are cooking
Algorithm finally did something right
Bro u have to do release it at 23 may 2026 cuze my birthday cames at 23 may
i will be happy if this doesnt get delaid ONE MORE TIME
Take all the time you need. I don't have enough money to buy it anyway.
"Oh God, just help me survive till May 26."
Why don't you buy car brands?
Don't try ordering doordash May 26 - June 2026. Nobody is coming.
Que GTA sea ETERNO
"Great, i need to be alive one more year till this sh1t comes up!"
4 days not even 100 million views. Rockstar fell off
We got a GTA VI trailer before GTA VI
that frame dip at 20s is harsh
Now waiting for gameplay

Anyone going to talk about landing scene where Lucia jumps off a ladder huge difference than GTA 5 where if you jump off you fall like a ragdoll this is going to be the best game
Why does Jason look like Arthur morgan
"Huge luck that i started playing GTA V in 2020, so I basically only wait for 5 years"
Im not buying it till 2029
Plz dont say that the game theme is that of like far cry 6 very much yellowish and warm
Phil have both hands?

I skipped school to play the original Vice City. Now I will skip lunch at the retirement home to play the new Vice City.

"It takes to log rockstar 500 million people are tired from rockstar ,36 years to make a game what a joke,i hope its better than RDII online otherwise its end of rockstar for ever"
This was all just filler cut scene nonsense...show gameplay or dont show anything at all. Nothing about that got me excited for the game. Legit nothing. They showed 4-6 scenes of her mounting him like damn yo we get it they are together this company continues to disappoint
why he said: love you jason?
I am waiting for that day
Soon
"I saw ""May 26"" and almost shat myself. YOU'RE GIVING US 3 WEEKS OF NOTICE?!? Then I saw 2026 and I was very, VERY sad."

Still waiting........

Truly this game cost more than 2 Billions !!!
The voice of Joel??????
"oh well, of course there had to be a woman now!!! And you know what? For as much as I'm against woke, I really like that a woman joined the protagonists and playable characters. I just hope Rockstar doesn't force us into the diseased view of Man Equals Woman because the beauty of both is that they are NOT EXACTLY THE SAME."
You should give detail in the cash counter place
"Gah dam , those graphics are awesome"
Drequan Priest OG Loc
Imagine releasing the trailer the same week you announce another delay lol.
Ethan: Jason!
"El primer triler me sorprendido pero este me deja mal; grficos casi como el GTA V, y ensearon demasiado el culo de la muchacha. Me hubiera gustado ver ms la ciudad, ms accin y a los personajes, estos parecen aburridos y parece que al final de cada misin abra besos y tocadas de culo para eso voy a Po,r,nHub. Pensaba que no, pero con esos grficos ahora pienso que lo lanzarn en Switch 2 pero recortado."

"I thought for a long time that the girl on top of the other girl in this 1:59 scene was Lucia, but if you look closely, the one at the bottom is actually Lucia instead! Which makes me wonder, who's the girl tackling Lucia down like that, possible antagonist or just a goon? It's good to see that our protagonists aren't some modern gods that are unable to be challenged like this, I am very much looking forward what kind of conflicts our characters are gonna face in this game!"

There should be limitations , there should be difference in game or movies , All aprts were best except this one sorry its not according to our expectations , Its look like hollywood movie but in animation style not a game....... GTA 5 was best where there was three characters of friends and that was amazing game actually , no vulgar content js=ust a action game !"

They pay for all of these graphics and a beast computer system when all we need is a decent tv and an hdmi cable to over power their little graphics they need to constantly tweak"

"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world."
I am betting on my life the man in the beginning jason is talking to is Tommy Vercetti
come on i thought its 2025
"""Gta VI is not a game it's a lifestyle"""

Ditunda sampe 2026

Phil cassidy is okay because the 3D univers and the HD univers are different
"Its looks good, but once again I'm not getting the vibe of compelling character narratives such as in GTA IV."
This doesnt look any better than V and the Jason character voice acting is awful like a bad tv show hired a random guy
Trailer 3 is gonna be Amazing!
This is 2025
This ones for the peopel who still believe modern GTA airn connected to older GTA games....Phils in the game.

"My GTA story and prediction since part 1 (ill keep it short) - I found out about GTA back in high school. Someone traded me the PS1 game (which also had the london version) for a pair of headphones. Had no clue what the game was when I got it. Went home and played it with my friend and we loved it. Had alot of funI said the basis of this game is the greatest thing evernow if the could make it like the game Driver (which was bug at the time) meaning first person view, this would hands down be the best game EVER!!! They did it in part 3 and now 20+ years laterhere we are."

its gonna be sad if at the beginning of the game you can choose which protagonist you will play and the one that you didn't choose will be the one who will betray you in the end. because lets be honest its not a GTA game without your closest friend betraying you.

"It's Valid to want every building to be enterable & destroyable, Something I'm not seeing coverage on is the farm life Like hopefully we get something funny like fainting goats & scary stuff to for our curiosity & amusement. I wanna be able to have the opportunity to be able to passive with animals & have them respond to the character if they've been good & Bad in honor, that way there's a trust boundary with animals & having them travel around with you, have it be any animal you want it to be so there's choices. Fill it with nonchalant References too Keep Celebrities Mission's Flowing with more & more Celebrities who want in on the Action. Can totally see Jelly Roll being implemented, same with Snoopdogg & Eminem. Ect. Ect. List goes on & on for that."

It seems that we have said goodbye to GTA forever and moved to a game that replaced creativity with porn and women's asses.. I feel sad when I see artistic bankruptcy spreading among games.. But our hope is in the new game developers who will be far from the agenda of pornographic and perverted companies and will develop for us beautiful games as before.
"The fact that people ACTUALLY have stopped drug addictions, etc, because of this game is phenomenal"

"GTA IV graphics was already good enough. I wish Rockstar focused more on developing a deeper and longer story with more in-game choices and more diverse missions with real consequences instead of continuing GTA V immersive world with psychopaths blowing everything up without having any remorse or real consequence. That kind of improvement would blow my mind. A better graphic with extremely detailed visuals dont impress me that much. For now, all I can see is just a continuation of GTA V with better visuals. I hope the story will go deeper and the game will be longer in story, and not just bigger in space."
"3rd day, still cant get enough of it lol watching this kinda better than playin the V"

"Well, at the first glance I mistakenly saw May 26, 2025 I play games in PC and 'GTA VI' won't be released on PC at the beginning that's why I was thinking which console to buy between PS5 and Xbox X in a few days reading comments and scrolling. There i noticed everyone saying about surviving another year which made me confused that why only another year while it's coming in just 16 days! then I checked the date again in the video and"

This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
We definitely need a thing where we can ask Rockstar of at least a few tracks us fans want on the radio or on the ifruit earpods. Fort minor remember the name would go hard in the gym (I use it for boxing in the gym sometimes) and for a cool mid 2000's track eric prydz call on me.

"At 0:43, beer jiggle is amazing, but the American flag only has 4 stars?"
i'd genuinely love to know what is going through the 77k people who disliked this
"Fun fact: May 26 is the day Ray Liotta died the actor who voiced Tommy Vercetti in GTA: Vice City. Its also the date of Bonnie Parkers funeral (from the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde), held on May 26, 1934 while Clydes funeral was the next day, May 27."
Does it mean that we get mad? From 2025 to 2026

I reckon it has way better clothing mechanics, yeah yeah I know it's a clothing dress game but guys I stop and am impress by the quality that game provides, I honest reckon rockstar better watch out for epic games engine, I'm a person who refuses to play fortnite as an adult, rockstar ain't ahead in evething coz guys let your gf on your pc and turn the setting up to max and zoom in you'll freak with the detail and engine"

"Back in high school, I asked my cousin to buy me GTA 5, promising to pay him back in a month. My parents gave me 2$ a day for school, but I didn't eat or spend it on anything else, just tucked it under my pillow to give him. Played for 12 years. A lot has changed since then - graduated, moved countries, got married. And here we are."

"Unfortunately, the inclusion of sexual content will limit the games availability in countries that ban this kind of material. It feels unnecessarygreat graphics and great sound design already make it appealing. People will play it with or without the sexual content, especially if the core gameplay is solid. Sometimes less is more. But hey, who am I to judge, right?"
It will be the biggest flop in gaming history.

"Former Candidate of Provincial Parliament Calls for Action: Spread the Word as Much as We Can Former BC Conservative Party candidate Simon Chandler calls on people to help stop the CCPs organ harvesting crimes. (The Epoch Times) Simon Chandler, a former British Columbia Conservative Party candidate, shared his thoughts after watching the film: This (organ harvesting) is happening on such a massive scale. We had no idea it was this widespread. We now have witnesses who escaped China and came to Canada. We believe what theyre saying is credible. He called for action: We need to pay more attention to whats happening and speak to party leaders, Members of Parliament, provincial lawmakers, and officials in both the U.S. and Canada. We need to tell them about this. We should do everything we can. Canada has close ties with China, and laws like the Foreign Influence Registry Act would help in situations like this. Taiwanese Immigrant: Everyone Should Condemn Forced Organ Harvesting Ruby, a Taiwanese-Canadian living in Vancouver, said: Its shocking that forced organ harvesting is actually led or at least approved by the government. No matter what country it happens in, thats deeply shameful, especially when its being deliberately covered up. I think everyone should speak out and condemn this. She said that living in a democratic country has helped her appreciate values like freedom and mutual respect, and that makes it easier to see clearly what the CCP is doing. Ruby added that organ donation is supposed to be a sacred act, but the CCP is turning it into a business by forcibly taking organs from people. That completely defiles the sacred mission of medicine. Its a huge insult, she said."

2:10 LC Sign reference?
"God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. We are all sinners and separated from God, but He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to save us. Jesus died for our sins and rose again, offering us the gift of eternal life. By believing in Him and accepting His sacrifice, we can be forgiven and have a personal relationship with God. Salvation is a free gift, and all we need to do is trust in Jesus and follow Him. Would you like to ask any questions or learn more about this?"

Ok my take on their relationship is that Jason is actually a deep undercover cop using Lucia to get to some higher targets. But hes also falling in love with her. The game will have a finale where he chooses love or his mission. He chooses neither and goes out in a blaze of glory.
There is a cat
We miss Gta Vice City
Ive said from the first trailer Jason sounds like Nolan North and nothing at the moment makes me think its anyone else
This is gonna be amazing i cant stop watching the trailer may 26 2026 cannot come fast enough

I only got to play GTA V in 2020, bcoz thats when I finally had a PS4. Bought a 2nd-hand copy for like 1,000, just to finally try it Id been dreaming of that moment for years, bruh!!! Then last year, I was so freaking happy when they announced GTA VI! Like, its real. Its finally happening. That trailer? Proof! Big shoutout to Rockstar for making this dream real. My main goal this year and next? Just survive and stay tough, coz I need to be alive for GTA VI. May 10, 2025 - 12:48 pm"

"The difference in graphics from trailer 1 to 2 is striking, I'm ecstatic to experience this, only GTA can convey this feeling..."

No gameplay just cut scenes full of ai.

I hope I'm alive to see this game in 2026. The single player alone seems like a game you could play in a bunker / desert island and never see the same thing. Man what a hot story. I want to play this so bad

People don't seem to understand that these delays have little to do with the game not being ready earlier but more to do what the fact that Rockstar has been convinced to wait to release when the new PlayStation console is also ready to be released in order to drive pull through revenue

"One of the two protagonist will probably have to die at the end of the game. Like Gta5. And I don't want to get spoiled so i'll probably buy a Playstation or Xbox when this game comes out just to avoid spoilers, even though I'm a hardcore PC gamer."
Ngl this Bonnie n Clyde type story is pissing me off
Plenty of cakes around

I highly suggest nobody pre-buys this but wait until it's actually out because you will pay early and then they will extend the time again while keeping your money. Do NOT believe the May 2026 date.

GTA VI isn't just a gameit's a mirror showing us how far we've fallen. Vice City 2.0? Its not entertainment. Its a warning.
Vice city is mad for some people Eagerly waiting
Who else is here before this blows up
0:59 .........he's so a cop
This is my favorite game i want to buy it now but i must wait 1 year

New game idea for 2035 open world in the comics eria were each map is it's own planet with there own moons and have space ships to get from a to b and each solar system has its own sun but when you get to a different planet it could have all sorts of animals and or aliens or humans some more advanced than today and other solersistm there could be like in red ded times
I don't know why it feels like this would be the greatest gimmick of the year.

"""We got more guns than the law allows' This game looks like it's going to have the magic of vicecity Time to put batter... all over my face."
I won't be able to afford this until 2028 lol
Why did I move here I guess it was the weather
""""""
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Cant wait for this gamereally wish it comes out quickly
"de las 95 millones de vista de este video no fue en consolas, si fue en PC."
Survive till 2026
On my birthday
On my birthday
add the fn five seven 5.7X28mm pistol please! also i think the guns holding position should be adjusted to resemble other first person shooter more visible in screen
I can't even guess what parts might be gameplay. The whole trailer looks like cutscenes
1:51
"Well, hopefully the writing is better than GTA V because Red Dead 2 was some of the best ever. The relationship angle is intriguing but also could be an EZ-pass if they low ball the poignant parts of the real relationships. Fact: relationships are HARD WORK and these characters look pretty generic. If the story is generic, then HARD pass for me."
The initial download for this game is gonna take a week and then take up all of the space on your memory lol
0:22 MICHAEL: THERE IT IS THATS MY BOAT!!
I swear rockstar be pushing they games back by a year and it pmo
love you lucia
we need this trailer to beat subway surfer which has 361 million views
"The guy sounds like character from old GTA games, with a weird voice not matching him... compared to GTA 4 and 5 voice actors."
I'm still in disbelief we got trailer 2
expectative 100%
100 milliom views in 3 days is insane
Algorithm finally did something right
Vice city?
Heck yeah! Take your time and make it what we all want! Top of the line!
Definately pg 18 1:35
I hope I survive just one more year

Can't wait the next delay.

i was here
You know what's good about the release date? I finally have one. It takes the stress off. Now I can focus on and look forward to other things between here and then.
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Too real for a video game
If you've played GTA V long enough you see the similarities in the world/environments Copied and pasted GTAV made some cosmetic improvements but still looks like a GTAV
Not upload to800 years
Shot on PS5 live huh ?
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Can't unhear Master Shake.
New quest- Survive until May 26th 2026.
The club is gonna be crazy

My old Gpu seeing this: welp i need to upgrade my boi for this treasure
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"I dont know if this game would be worth the money or if the gameplay would be as good, but this trailer really did make me feel better about the story. The couple dynamic looks fun and the dialogue looks tight"
I WAS HERE
Another billion dollars for rockstar
im gonna be 76 years old in the future only waiting for the 3rd trailer

2013 -2026.
"I was 11 years old when GTAV came out, Ill be 24 when GTAVI drops"
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
dropping a trailer then making us wait another YEAR is crazy
All we gotta do is make it till around the end of this month next year and itll be in our hands..well I might give it time to let the price go down a bit and determine whether its really worth the money or not.
Who else is here before this blows up
I think I busted a nut
Can't wait to see how old Rocktars game design still is.
Pure talent. No words
This is basically just life remade as a game now
This gave me chills in the best way
The jiggle physics werent necessary vro
Pure talent. No words
Okay but is there a main character thats female this time???
im calling out for May 26th next year
Maybe the best trailer ever made
I cannot believe its actually close to releasing.
So I still have to wait another year Jesus christ

Why not for PC? MF!
0:23
They aint need to make Lucia that thick
lets hope theres always no building closed it would be cool
"As long as someone mentions the name Trevor Phillips somewhere in the game, I am good."
Honestly trailer 1 excited me more than trailer 2.. hopefully it will turn out as fun and exciting as trailer 1.. Kinda brought my hope down with this trailer.
p 0-r n theft auto
Still looks whack. Gonna be a woke game and gonna flop.

No game play so we hope but Nice vido
And bananero ??
Good things come when the time is right.
Cue up Wlison Philips Hold on for one more day
"Aside from Franklin, Jason might be the most relatable GTA protagonist. From what I can tell it seems like the guy just wants a better life away from what hes normally used to, but things just keep getting worser and worse, who knows how things will be by the end of the game, hopefully we get another multi select ending again, something along the lines of as Jason kill Lucia, or as Lucia Kill Jason, or the ride off into the sunset end"
"Nothing more than just another way for people to live out their sinful desires vicariously. How pathetic, Lord have mercy!"
Anybody realize there were moking us at the first?
.
Every time I watch this video makes me more exited to buy and play this game. Really good guys. In the third trailer give us the hint if we can afford this game
we got gtavi trailer before gtavi.
It would be cool if Rockstar added blinkers to cars
I wont get to see it .

"Ugh, no."
jebe kevu
are we gonna be alive?
Cerdaa
Why isnt the chick white?
i already have my piggy bank ready for next year
You know what actually be funny af if it come out on 26 of this year it would go down in gaming history and what if I was right its already on wishlist idk maybe Im just thinking to hard on it but seems a little fishy they realise trailer 2 a year before its actual realise and plus I been along time fan of rockstar and just feel somethings a little off I have full trust that when it does come out it be like no game we have ever seen it will be amazing I mean just look at red dead 2 that come out in 2018 so you can just imagine at this point I would pay a 200 dollar price tag even 300 doller price tag if it comes out earlier or on 26 of this year
the amount of detail alone is worth the price of admission.
Isnt it USP United States of paranoia?
Its coming out a day before my birthday may 27 i couldnt be happier

"Dear Rockstar Games, Im a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto V and have spent years enjoying your amazing work. Now that weve been waiting over 13 years for GTA VI, I hope you make it a game that truly lives up to the long wait and I believe you can. Here are some things I (and many other players) really hope to see in GTA VI: 		A powerful and realistic AI system where people react smartly, police behave naturally, and enemies think and adapt. 		Stronger, smarter police that feel like a real threat and not just something we can escape easily. 		Stunning graphics that bring the world to life. 		A deep and emotional storyline with amazing characters. 		A big open world that feels real, free, and full of fun things to do. 		The ability to fully complete the game with tons of activities and secrets. 		Many types of animals, including wild ones we can hunt and interact with. 		Fish and underwater animals that we can transform into whenever we want (not just once like in GTA V). 		Real-life car brands and dealerships with their actual names and designs. We want GTA VI to feel alive, wild, and worth every year we waited. Please make it the ultimate open world experience ever made. Thank you for all your amazing work. We believe in you! A passionate player from the GTA community."
This is why we let rockstar cook
see you in 2027

The first reason for failure in studying from 2026 to 2030!
Rockstar you really make enough wait until 2026. It was really supposed to come out in 2025.
Kind of insane that this still isnt number one on trending.
Well 2026 and the next one 2126 yup
At the end and online aliens r doing anaI with jesus
"Graphics is next level but some animations could be better but this is just a trailer, they have a whole year to finish it. Im excited."
Woman character soooo ugly 1:28
I think this will be my first time actually experiencing a gta release
"No matter how realistic these games get, they will NEVER use the knobs on the doors. (But maybe it's just for specific instances. )"
Looks good to me release it
We survived a pandemic for this
And aliens do anaI with jesus
And aliens?
"Ok, stay alive folks."
Does jesus come?
"Brian the older guy sounds like Stephen Root from King of the Hill, No Country for Old Men and so many other great movies"
Pretty good trailer. I feel like we need a few shots of Lucia jumping into Jason's arms or grinding on him. Feels like there was a missed opportunity there.
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Tung tung tung sahurrrrrrr

So I guess at the end of the first trailer when they said coming 2025 they meant the second trailer and not the game
"quase 100 milhes em 3 dias, visualizao pra poha!!!"
Oh wow it's so realistic
story mode finna be gas
Excellent! Now tell us itll be coming to PC as well.
And she got pregnant via anaI.

Seems like a game for kids just like the 5th. No more gritty crime dramas like 4th I guess
"I was born with one hand, and faced so much adversity growing up. I thought I wasnt gonna be able to take care of myself as a man and my family. I was denied my childhood dream of going to the navy seals. Watching you give out game and showing us its possible through your page continues to inspire and motivate me to be the best version of myself and to stay focused on my purpose. Im Manifesting that Ill be at 1Million Subs one day and I wanna say I thank you for being that inspiration Rockstar"

I can t stop smiling watching this
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!
Jason's stance in the thumbnail gives me cop vibes. Ex cop or undercover. Not saying its true. But the way he holds his gun is experienced.
This may be the last GTA game I ever play. I hope it's still playable on the other side.
https://youtube.com/shorts/COaQFnFeHZE?si=vzoUIcIzMqJ3omuP
Nobody gonna say that we got GTA VI trailer before GTA VI
Barbershop ahh music
I think they went back to vicecity
Like wtf man
Do we think Jason owed rent or he gets paid (free rent) to go pick up rent from that dudes properties? Did I miss something that made this not an option?
Una total obra de arte
"A few of these scenes look so real that even on pretty close examination, it's had to tell if it's filmed or rendered."
"So is this going to be on the next generation of consoles? Totally skipped this generation so hoping yes, and the new ones come out around the same time."
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
I hope my series s can handle this
"Very nice, but are the graphics in the video from in game or just cut scenes ?! The street scene at 2:00 was inspired by the movie Fast and Furious 5 !"
It's taking forever.... I need it!

Is button mash running still a thing in these games?
Hey GTA I remember how the players will play./FPC player: 10
If only Valve where this fast with their new game chapter's. Still waiting for a part 3 of many games. Great work Rockstar showing Valve that it does not need to take a Half-Life
I know the music will be bangers.

"Idc what anyone says, they took their time with this, im a South Florida native, this WILL be legendary i see it"
"Me acabo de dar cuenta que no es para tanto, en el trailer salen demasiadas cinemticas y cuando es gameplay se nota que los grficos estn a la altura de uncharted 4 pero no ms, aunque es verdad que en mundo abierto ya es un logro, las partes de gameplay son super cortas y en seguida meten cinemtica creando una simbiosis perfecta que marea al espectador y parece ms de lo que es"

"To those confused regarding gameplay/in-game footage rockstar elaborated ""comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes."" i personally 100% believe rockstar on this if you know what to look for it's obvious. I think character interactions throw people off with Rockstar's implementation of AI from Take-Two's ""System and Method for Virtual Navigation in a Gaming Environment."" patent US11620781B1 This patent essentially built on AI principles to provide adaptive, responsive interactions that feel lifelike by dynamically choosing and combining modular animations based on contextual cues like weather, physical state, or environmental variables. Check the scene at 0:27 the way Jason responds to the NPC/neighbors greeting with appropriate emotion then again at 0:47 the way he looks in interest at the police interaction as he drives by. 0:34 as he taps steering wheel from boredom/to the music in these scenarios his engaged with the environment in ways that won't affect player control. When all NPC's, characters follow those same principals the animations feel so much more fluid/dynamic & look/feel so much more alive where you'd think rockstar painstakingly handcrafted every scene. (0:38 way NPC's check Jason out, 0:42 walk around him) All these timecodes look at camera shots, lighting and character interactions are basic/stiff, less engaged in contrast to cutscenes at 0:50, 1:47 Timecodes below could theoretically be gameplay when considering the patent and how rockstar editor works. I think this makes it very easy to distinguish difference between cutscenes & gameplay. * potential activities; 0:32 - hold ups/robberies, 0:38 - GTASA style exercise, 2:08 - GTAV style TV, 2:20 - dates, * player interactions; 0:41- carrying items, 1:17 hot coffee, 1:50 drive-by shooting, 2:27 - shooting helicopter, * living breathing city; 0:35, 0:46 - police interactions, 1:27 - community service, 2:06, 2:07 - strip club, 2:28, * free-roam; 2:33, * missions; 2:18, 2:22, 2:24, * others i'm uncertain; 1:37, 1:39, 1:44, 2:00, * others i cannot clearly categories but feel could happen in gameplay; 1:30 (2s), 2:29, While perhaps a bit of a stretch I could see 0.08 where Jason fixing the roof being gameplay blend/transitioning to cutscene then again at 0.26 as Jason walks through door we go back to gameplay. Scenes like 1:27 including Lucia could randomly occur during gameplay while playing as Jason I hadn't spent long looking through the trailer timecodes above just a rough few watches to quickly evaluate differences between cutscenes as they felt so obvious so maybe this insight might help others see the trailer in the way i do."

SELF CONTROL
"Opening this video I was betting Rockstar would somehow choose a massive banger I didn't yet know for the trailer. Wasn't disappointed, again"
They are going to make a fortune with this. This will be the highest selling media of all time.
Where is red dead tho?
Both of them are so fine
"The question that begs to be asked is, will the character get stuck in the wall at some point?"

This feels more like a movie then a game
"No se iludam, lembra do GTA V ? os caras fizeram o jogo to mal otimizado e cheio de erros que levaram quase 2 anos para deixar rodar perfeitamente. Resumindo, a galera dos consoles vai comprar a verso Beta e o pessoal dos PC vai pegar uma verso melhor (definitiva) rico em detalhes."
2026 cant come fast enough man.
Who else is here before this blows up
We have only waited 500 years

Hopefully the voice actors are better than the ones in GTA V. So far it's not looking too promising.

Cad o preo e o gameplay s em outubro?
Is that Stephen Root I heard?
The song for the trailer is so exciting on the freeway lol
It may be a year we will have to wait for this game but it will be worth it
Lucia bad as hell
This is what the GTA V Trailer 1 looked like to me in 2011
"A lot of character and gameplay details can change in 1 year. This isn't even the finished product. I have a feeling it will be super polished by the beginning of January 2026 and ready for release. For example, Look at the trailer 2 for GTA 4. That video was posted one year before the official release of the game. Niko looks completely different from the final product."
RIP to all gamers along the way..
"I miss the time when games were games, not phorn for no brain people."

"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
I am here to be part of history
This trailer felt like they said silence peasants. The food will arrive when its ready and we all said yes master when we saw how it good it looked
i will buy this game
"The American economy is literally going to take a temporary hit on May 26th and May 27th from all the people calling out. And there will be a dilemma; everyone is gonna want to order fast food and pizza, but all the fast food and pizza delivery guys are gonna be home playing the game instead."
At least they added the exact date so now they can't delay it again
shut up and take my money
"Game is gona be ,same stupid map nothing new just better graphics ,money grabers like all of them"
"I can watch this trailer every day and I won't get sick of it, oh my gosh, this trailer is so good"
"In 0:22, Is it Michael's boat, which has been stolen in one of missions?"
"Nah bro this is NOT gameplay, this was filmed it looks so real"
The oppressor mk 3 is gonna be an absolute menace online
Why not just live real life instead?

How cool would it be when they have pretty much the whole world covered. Using the same technology as Microsoft uses with Flight Simulator. I believe the tech was developed by a French(?) company.

His better be very good
right before the end of the school year.....
Rockstar Games: we wont deliver in 2025 and knew this a long time a go. Let's feed them a trailer so they get hyped up and calm down
Apparently this game will cost Rockstar between 1-2 Billion dollars to make. I am willing to sacrifice more billionaires just to keep this series going
i need that videogame now
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Who here 200013

I hope the world becomes a better place in the next 20 years
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Who is here 2025
Anyone got Goosebumps say it!!

"With the current president, more of us might be living GTA instead of playing it."
Born too late to explore the Earth. Born too soon to explore the galaxy. Born just in time to be part of history.
This is the best trailer I've seen in my life
Thank you Rockstar for the improved bouncing cheeks technology
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
Hype @ it's Peak
Espero jugarlo en esta vida
So when is GTA 7?
"You explained this so well, thank you!"

rockstar you pmo btw i'm a time traveler from 2030 gta vi didn't release until 2029
People are planning to be absent on May 26th.
What is this terrible reality? I am shocked.
"Rockstar Games , i have a suggestion , how about this time around in GTA VI ,cars run out of gas/fuel and we have to refuel them huh ?"
Thank you for featuring Haitian culture!!!!
Been waiting for this my whole life
I would really like to see a surprise like you can go with a spaceship to a little city that's already built in the moon or something
i want this !!!!!
No one cares about taking time off. Almost all game anticipations are the same. Yeah looks like an ok game in the trailer. Hopefully it plays smoothly. Hopefully it doesn't play like GTA 4.
"Roger that , over"
Surviving until 2026 has never been more of a priority.
"now we wait untik 2026 and then they Will say ""sorry it's in 2028""."
Game grapics are very good but think story is bad
Hasta que no vea un cameo del bananero no me interesa comprarlo
coming soon in 2037
It's cinema
Rockstar aura999999999
Imagine not gooning over ts trailer
Jason is definitely undercover and lou is definitely only out to help take down a bigger criminal organization that shes already involved with. Finally playing as the opps(you know darn well they are in GTA)in a gta game.
Are y'all ever gonna revive CJ?
WHAT A WUNDERFUL YEAR
I really like this game and Razvan like it as well so it might probably be the game of the year like 90%.Good luck!
Will we be able to be a cop on xbox?
"Me prometo a m mismo que voy a tener este juego, cueste lo que me cueste.!!!"

Vice city looks epic in this incarnation, the detail is exquisite the way the beer in the bottle reacts when it's moved is amazing! I remember watching a preview for the original GTA on the PlayStation where they were running over sheep in a car and shooting Hare Krishna monks with an Uzi SMG come a long way in under 30years"

"Hey Rockstar Games Team! Im a huge fan of your work and the GTA universe. Inspired by the vibe of GTA VI, I created an original track called Paradise Lost (Jason Duvals Song) a tribute to the chaos and beauty of your upcoming masterpiece. Id be thrilled if this song could find a place in the games soundtrack maybe in a Vice City radio station or a cinematic moment? If your team acquires music for the game, Id be happy to discuss licensing this track! Ive attached the video for your consideration. Thank you for inspiring creators like me!"
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
All these details are awesome and then 1:28 we see this hair on her. I expected much more. Dissapointed .. Please work on the hair shaders

2:10 is that the PS6
This is the most suberb ever
0:27 hiiiiii jasooooon!!!!!
This is running on a base PS5. Incredible.
The woke left are complaining this game is too straight.. LOL!!.. Maybe this game just ain't for you..
By watching this trailer you've seen 95% of the SP campaign.

GTA
"It feels like a clip from the new movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith, it's going to be a luxury"
I think the reason they release the pc version later is because ps5 can only run it on 30fps and then everybody would buy a pc just because they want to play it on 60fps. Theyre releasing the pc version likely around the ps6 release date
0:59 seems off sync
where's Phil Collins in the air tonight
0:22 MICHAELS BOAT!
THEY CAN TAKE ALL THEIR TIME WITH THIS NEW TRAILER.

Rockstar you definitely lost a customer here I don't like being lied to, I won't spend 100$ on this game. Have fun designing your game till 2030, i will not be there and if you keep at this bs no one will be"

"Tbh kinda disappointed with the cars, like how hard is it to make the car look as real as possible as in real life, rockstar could've easily done it if they want to but they didn't, I know they're trying to avoid copyright claim but as long as the car name is not the same as in real life then it would be no problem right. Like we've been waiting for 13 years, 13 YEARS and we can't get cars look as real as possible? And for PC gamer we should wait for 2 or 3 more years from 2026 like c'mon you guys. I know you have the ability and resources to do so (makes everything looks as real as possible as in real life) man, please rockstar I beg you"
"Goosebumps I mean literally to see very authentic and original graphics. Amazing . Yeah Guys , That is called changed in GTA 6 I whooo hoooooo I mean why company invest 2 billion dollars on this game ??????? Any guess ? I mean I am literally shock to see this video , Now that's called the graphics everyone want. Rockstar you make everyone shock. Awesome few seconds and I thought I watch a Movie Amazing I wish I play this amazing game one day if I am alive ...."

"jason and lucia sound a bit blant and stale, dont they?"
"I am perfectly OK with waiting another year if that means that it'll be a finished product when it does release. However, Rockstar Games, please...could you just bump it up 4 days, and make it May 22nd, 2026? That way, here in the United States, we'll have the long Memorial Day weekend to play, instead of it coming out on Tuesday when we'll have to go back to work? That would be fantastic!"

In what year do you expect GTA 7 to be released? I think it will be released in 2041. What about you ?
Not actual gameplay! So its just no better than any other trailer that shows the best graphics but $5 says the real game will be just a slightly better graphics of GTA 5

I practice GTA V every day, but honestly... it's not the same. I miss Vice City without ever having lived it. I miss you, even if you haven't really appeared yet. I'm ready to be Jason. I'm not just talking about the heists, I'm talking about following you wherever you go. You're already a legend, and I'll be there on day one. You bring the anger, I'll bring the wheel. And if we have to run away, I'll drive. I'll wait for you."

"I just always thought that the NPC interactions and animations from the GTA5 trailer were over exaggerated compared to what we actually got, and it think it will happen again. I hope to be wrong but you can go and see it by yourself that we didn't get the in-game immersive stuff that was shown in the trailer."
Pure talent. No words
"SLk, esse jogo vai ser incrvel mano, j vou juntar meus 800 reais pra garantir a compra"
Theory: what if they extended the date because they WANT people to be mad and give more hype but then is gonna release it exactly june 27

"Rockstar should take a new look little to the reality system of the gameplay including the reality of survival and healing system, and more stuffs like this, like food system, water, sleeping, to add more suspense to the game, not only improve graphics and add huge map, that what gonna make the games released little repeating, for example when you receive a tons of bullets and you still running like you had nothing in GTA 5, there is no reality here about play a game simulate the life in a very detailed city or a country, anywas the case, what we see here is a unbelievable great job i hope we gonna see a lot of surprises and changes from rockstar developing this game"

Prediction: There will be crime in this game
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
I think we all know where were going first
"The upcoming release of GTA VI has stirred excitement among many gamers, but I find myself deeply concerned by the direction the series seems to be heading. My honest opinion is that I do not agree with the inclusion of indecent scenes and overly sexualized female characters that seem designed to provoke certain desires. This is not about censorshipit's about responsibility. When you look back at GTA V, the in-game nightclub scenes already pushed the boundaries of decency. Now, with the promise of even more realistic physics and immersive graphics in GTA VI, I fear that these elements will only be amplified. Some may argue that the game includes warnings and age restrictions, but I believe this is far from enough. We all know that websites like Pornhub are accessed by children as young as 7 or 8, despite clear warnings. These measures simply aren't effective at preventing exposure. In fact, the hyper-realistic depictions in games like GTA can sometimes be more impactful than what is found online because they are interactive and immersive. This creates a deeper imprint, normalizing behavior and imagery that should not be considered entertainment. The argument that age restrictions and warnings are sufficient falls flat when faced with reality. If we know that minors are finding ways to access adult content online, why would it be any different with video games? The mere existence of a warning label is not a safeguard; it's a disclaimerone that is often ignored or easily bypassed. This isn't just about protecting children; it's about maintaining a sense of decency and integrity in what we consider 'entertainment.' No matter how old you areeven if you're 80there are certain things that should not be trivialized or made commonplace, especially under the guise of interactive storytelling. When we normalize indecency in entertainment, we erode the boundaries of what is acceptable in real life. We shouldn't let the pursuit of profit or the excuse of 'realism' allow the devil to win in this regard. Games can be thrilling, exciting, and immersive without resorting to such extremes. It's time we hold game developers accountable for the kind of content they produce and the impact it hasnot just on children, but on society as a whole. Do you agree with me?"
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
It looks so amazing
I ve had this on repeat all day
at 36 years old.. maybe i have 2 more gta's left.

"To appreciate how long has it been since GTA Vs release: I graduated High school. Graduated college. Got engaged and married. I died stepping on a WWII shell while on vacation in France. I was resurrected as an omniscient being in another galaxy. I created and raised many conscious beings at the edge of the universe Came back to earth, find a job. Bought a second hand PS5 just to play GTA VI. What a ride."

"Did you guys know that the B-2 Spirit is a stealth bomber developed by Northrop Grumman, featuring a flying wing design that allows it to evade radar detection. Introduced into service in 1997, it is operated by the U.S. Air Force and has a crew of two pilots. Designed for strategic bombing missions, it can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons and is capable of deep penetration into enemy territory. With a wingspan of 172 feet, the B-2 is powered by four General Electric engines and can fly long distances without refueling, making it one of the most advanced aircraft in military history. Stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base, it is recognized for its distinctive black shape and ability to operate in all weather conditions. Equipped with sophisticated avionics, digital fly-by-wire controls, and advanced composite materials, the B-2 plays a crucial role in modern aerial warfare. It can deliver precision strikes, carry bunker-busting bombs, and evade enemy air defenses with its low observable profile. The aircraft has participated in conflicts such as Kosovo and Iraq, demonstrating its strategic importance. With a range of over 6,000 miles, mid-air refueling capability, and high operational readiness, the B-2 remains a symbol of American air power and technological excellence."
I cried when they delayed it again

"It looks like Jason originally had long hair and beard and shaves it all off presumably to evade the police. Is Duvall even his last name, or has he changed it."
"Locked 30fps with no 60fps / performance mode on console, no purchase. This is a huge mistake considering PC sales were only 3% of GTA5 sales - the rest were all console."
Hopefully they have different player stories

"Rockstar go rock bottom for not releasing it on PC at the same time, you guys shouldn't neglect PC players since they are the one who made your GTA 5 as popular as it is now. You don't deserve respect from PC players, Good Luck selling your chips on PS5 and Xbox whatever."
"After waiting this long, this trailer is very underwhelming. RIP Rockstar Games"
As someone who was playing GTA Vice city stories at the very age of 6 or smthn... Im crying hard. I miss my PSP and sht looks amazing wth

Hii
Lezzz go
"Jason will become, or start off as an undercover cop as his description says hes done with petty crime, and looking to change courses. Lucia is let out of jail way earlier than she expected, and Jason picks her up. Unbeknownst to her, the conditions of her early release is that Jason will be secretly informing the police on Lucias plans and status outside of jail. A big theme in the first trailer is trust. One tense scene in particular shows Lucia asking Jason if she can trust her and he appears conflicted/nervous. The ending will feature multiple options to breakup/betray/team up etc. this is just my theory from what Ive noticed"
The delay is worth it!
Im here

Hi
"I hope Rockstar sees this; the hair physics don't look right yet. They're obviously better than GTA 5, but I feel like they move a bit too much. Case in point: 1:27----Lucia's hair is moving in a very unnatural way, even though she's simply walking. And the hair wouldn't move like that from wind either. So yeah, I really hope the hair physics can be tweaked."

"You know i never really thought about it but actually having some kind of 'legal' paying job in GTA would be kind of cool.... kind of like in 'Bully' when you had 2 classes a day to attend... you go to work do a little mini game as in do a couple of button promt sequences of the start of the day and fast forward to 5PM.... i get that GTA games 'kind of' have jobs like Taxi, Paramedic, Police ..etc.. but this could have been a cool addition.... I get that a LOT of players wouldn't be into it but it could be optional....."
"By the time it releases,i would be around 80"
This game can end wars an bring peace..just look at the love it's being given.

"Event Organizer Urges the Chinese Government to Respect Human Rights Ms. Suda Event organizer Ms. Suda said, Organ transplantation requires a high degree of moral and ethical considerations. In particular, from the perspective of medical ethics, the dignity and rights of organ donors must be respected to the greatest extent. However, the Chinese government seems to regard the bodies of its citizens as state property and believes that organs are also state property. This is a complete disregard for the human rights of its citizens and is absolutely intolerable. We must deeply understand this issue, and strongly urge the Chinese government to respect the human rights of its citizens."

Comment
THE EAGLES ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPS
"13:05 is so satisfying, not because of the deep ball being thrown but because its a redemption moment from the 2023 Super Bowl when Hurts failed the deep ball"
what!!!!!!!!!!! how did he do it????????????????/
jjkkll
too bad no one broke mahomes leg in this game
"Its still crazy how Saquon Barkley was almost irrelevant, and yet we dominated on all cylinders"
Still cry. Every single time
Other than the buccs Super Bowl this is the first not close Super Bowl game in a very long time
Anyone here just to watch happiness unfold in 2025
Why does it say 2024 and not 2025 Super Bowl?
I so loved this game.
A picksix in the superbowl against a 3 time champion as rookie on your birthday...nothings cooler than that
How bout the eagles bring the NFL community together haha
"Cowboys fan here...those freaking Eagles looked amazing...at least it wasn't the other Pennsylvania team, the Crapsburg Squeelers."
13:06
Pit
Philadelphia Eagles phl won
14:13 had to have been an illegal forward pass theres no way im not tweakin
Does anyone else come back and watch the highlights just to reminisce of such a glorious moment? Go birds! Eff the chiefs
Omg i didn't understand this sport although it seems entertaining but i don't know about its rules
Idk why Americans are crazy with this sport this was my favourite nfl highlights though
"34-0 might as well be the final score, the true score"

"who watching this in may, this video makes me feel better any time any of the other philly team losses"
Mr. PATRICK MOJON looks sad.
I love sports but I don't know how I can you do it follow up by @starboy TV
This will never get old
"On behalf of the Atlanta Falcons: THANK YOU, EAGLES! I JUST CAN'T STAND THOSE CHIEFS! LET SOMEONE ELSE WIN FOR A CHANGE!"
"As a Panthers fan, thank you Eagles and Philadelphia. Football is back! Eagles defense is unmatched, yall did the league a great service. Also, I blame Taylor Swift. Eagles were out for blood after all that nonsense."
"Coming back for a 3rd time to watch this. The first ring will always hold a special place in my heart, but its something about a definitive victory that makes me smile ear to ear"
Birds shouldve kept them at 0. Next time keep them at 0!!!!!!!
Anyone in May...best superbowl after the Seahawks won
Only 7 and a half minutes in and Ive wasted a half hour rewinding that pick and the defense just absolutely demolishing Mahomes. Philly is insane.
Just watched this again in May 25. Absolutely brilliant game plan and execution by the Eagles. Loved the epic beat down of KC. Thanks Philly from this Saints fan
I wonder what team destroys the Chiefs next
When are we getting this sb please
"Tuesday May 6, 2025 5:02pm"
Imagine how boring this game wouldve sounded if Joe Buck was announcing
I'm still watching this now in may
"Aye when coach said just call it, He knew he was better than the chiefs."
"As a eagles fan who's seen lots of eagles teams, This is the best eagles team ever!! HANDS DOWN!!"
May. Still watching this
"May 2025, still watching"
6:33 cap
Anyone still watching THE SUPERBOWL CHAMPS in May
I watch this once a week! Fly Eagles Fly!
That smooth af throw to the ref at 13:12 though...
Love how casual smitty runs that go route and watson behind him is running for his life to keep up
"7:19 ""They havent been able to do much against this formidable chiefs defense"" 17-0? The glaze despite them getting destroyed is insane work"
Why does Travis Kelsey get to wear different colored shoes?
10M views! The best Super Bowl ever! Go Birds!
Eagles won for every other team in the league
Broncos love this
LOL they were able to take their starters on both sides if the ball out and still won by 3 posessions. In the Superbowl
Enjoy your superbowl Eagles. We will see you again. So far were 1-1
Will forever be the era that other teams whine that the refs are on our side and we win championships.
"5 out of the last 6 and 3 wins Chiefs Kingdom, let the Dynasty Reign!"
Its May 4th. Whos still watching this masterpiece?
Going back to the Super Bowl even though I rooted for the Chiefs that Eagles defense was absolutely deadly. Props to the Eagles. They really played their hearts out
8:42 AJ Brown with the LeBron James celebration lol
Anyone back here in May of 2025? You already know by my profile pic that I enjoyed this.
PHI2204QBOL5
It hurts when hurts is on the jazz lol
When Berkeley and hurts are on the jazz you can't beat them
Refs gave up this game
5/3/2025 still enjoying this
Eagles are better fly eagles nobody likes the Chiefs
40-6 was the final score.
I was hoping the eagles wouldnt allow a single TD from KC. They should have shut them out.
Imagine catching 2 touchdowns in a Superbowl by mahomes and it means naught.
Still watching this on May 3rd!! Go Birds
BTA
I'm so proud of the eagles
"Whenever I have a bad day, this video always helps"
The day Philly gained the respect of all of America
the fact that mahomes made it to the superbowl with that o line really underscores how awful AFC defenses are.
This was one of the biggest hate watches in sports history. And I am here for it.
Saquon really helped Jalen with the pressure this game
"I am an eagles fan, but I also like the vikings and forty niners I can't choose so they are my 3 favorite teams"
This was a 40-6 game. Eagles put in their backups. Those last two tds count to no one
Patrick was pass the line
It's so nice that I can say o the eagle's have Superbowls now i was always a fan way before the Superbowl wins
FIB+FiB BOM

You could be watching these highlights for decades and itll never get old.
Eagles!! NFC EAST in the bowl! Take down the State Farm Chiefs. I guess Taylor was sitting in Jake's lap.
6:15 13:05 15:43

Fly eagles flyyyyy https://youtu.be/eKxL6aFCIZ8?si=D-d1Wn6HsU0BgJkW
It's obvious that the commentators wanted the Chiefs to win.
Where is the full game haters. Deion Sanders is coming back to the league I know y'all are intimidated.
Tom Brady is the G.O.A.T.
Buffalo wings never tasted so good
Bears fan here. Watching this in the end of April is still so satisfying lol
Impressive Watson Quick catch A running catching with a defense under your and top of you Feather him down
"Was so happy to see Patricia ""Kermit"" Mahomes and Travis Swift lose"
I hope this win lives on in everyones head and never slips away into history. It is THAT kind of win.
Chiefs got Owned
Whos watching this again today !!!!
Whos still watching this in 2025?
thank you eagles
yes
im so happy for the eagles
Best receiver in the league the slim reaper.
I feel like everyone enjoyed watching the chiefs get stomped
"Eagles played KC like a fiddle. Good on Philly, tough one for Chiefs."
Here to watch AGAIN!!!
En 6 15 anotaron sicologicamente K C supo que eran dbiles
"Jalen went crazy, defense went crazy, Jake Elliot went crazy, water boy went crazy letssss goooooo"
chefs are NOT GOODDDDD
Andy Reid@lets just leave this game and go get a cheeseburger
"sweet, sweet revenge..."
i hereby submit that.md.repon ali poor is helpless a physicall disabled person.i don't want to be aburden.to my family any more.please give mi a job.if some one give me a job i will be grateful for life.
I guess the chiefs really did pay off the refs cause 3 of them got fired
Mahomes has been regressing every year. Yeah they won the last two but definite win games have been decreasing. The chiefs had so many 1 point or 1 possession games they won because the other team messed up. KC about to be humbled for the next 3-5 years
"I Still Come back and watch This Masterpiece of performance Time , after time, after time , after time #BacktoBackChampsSoon"
"12:00, Kelce and 2 linemen completely gave up on the play. That was the moment I knew it was over. Go birds."
Don't like the Eagles. Their fans seem to be insufferable jerks. But the Chiefs are worse.
Nothing better than seeing Mahomes getting sacked!
"Lets be real, the eagles played am easy Chiefs team. Its not like the Chiefs are any good. The eagles are not that great either and im not impressed if they won the superbowl. IT MEANS NOTHING"
"I dont watch football but this was just disappointing from the chiefs, its like a kid singing infront of a crowd and gets stage fright, like what happened, but that long pass caught by D. Smith was insane"
Fun fact: this isnt your first time watching this
Neutral fan ... I had the biggest hardon for what the Eagles did to the Chiefs. Happiest I have ever been for a team that isn't my favorite team.
real score was 40-6 lets go birds!
Mahomes was running around for his life lol
I want to wrap this thing up and just take the limberty thropy and the ring
Fly Eagles Fly !
"Keep in mind, that actual score was 40-6, the eagles pulled their starters in the fourth quarter, so in reality the chiefs had only one touchdown"
"This is what happens when you're friends with Taylor Swift.. Let's go Eagles Underestimated and we did it The ""never buying a Philly Cheesesteak again"" is crazy"
Why are there so much ads
"Eagles win Super Bowl LIX, not my team!"
Still watching
Needed to inject this into my veins again.
5:48 to 6:30 is where the game was won. That series broke the Chiefs.
Waiting for the elf 2025 winner face to face woth superbowl champs
"One of the worst ""Games"" I've ever tried to watch in my life... Totally a joke on KC , it was supposed to be the Ravens, but ya know Mark Tardrews can't catch in important situations or playoffs at all sooooo... Eagles would of probably still won SB , but at least we would of had a Game... And ya know ya dedicated you're entire life to playing with balls and get paid millions for it , so least you could do is make it look good Fly Eagles and whatnot again though would of been better if The Redskins wouldn't of played butter ball with them"
I like to stop by every so often and watch this absolute beat down.
Go birds
"The bigger the stage, the better UNO plays. Says a lot about a QB"
"Hey NFL, can we get the full game?"
KC cant win without the Refs help. Fly Eagles Fly
"Division Super Bowl count Cowboys 5 Giants 4 Redskins 3 Eagles 2 Eagles are at the bottom of their own division for 64yrs now, theyre still sitting at the kids tableOUCH !! Emotional Damage"
"6:14 don't call out a horrible mistake Mahomes made, instead the NFL calls it a loss of focus... No he was pressured and made a horrible mistake because he isn't as good as the NFL says the Bobble head is."
"It may not be the best game compared to our last super bowl win, but this is by far the most satisfying super bowl win after losing to Kansas City the last time"
LETS RUN THIS ISH BACK!!!
Sometimes when Im having a bad day I watch this and it cheers me up so fast.
11:57 Seeing Mahomes running for his life while Kelce's just standing there never gets old.
just felt like watching it again
"14:15 ""beauty"""
350 Mill over cap. Can't win without cheating.
Gotta come back to this atleast twice a month still
Whose here in April 2025
"The cockiest franchise ever love my birds-throwing 60 yards while up 27 late in the third, we know how to stick and twist daggers"

4/20/2025
Can anyone break down which play truly shifted the momentum in this Super Bowl LIX matchup? Fascinating game!
"I watched the WHOLE game since the national anthem, My lord that I watched this Eagles Dethroned the Chiefs 40-22, Tell Andy Reid that three peat is doomed from the start of Eagles' intercepTOR the ball, not once but TWICE, I always said intercepTOR as every interceptions occurred, as a Falcon guy, tastes the cake."
Came back here just because
Super Bowl champs fly eagles fly
No run game No ht adjustments No creativity Thank you
Im just here to say I called this beat down the minute I knew it was a rematch. Honestly whoever came outta the AFC was getting stomped

"Chief, you Miss A dead simple.I love you"
Mom
Anyone here in April?
People were praising Xavier worthy for those yards this came when the game was already out of reach
6:13
Kelce sucked....was he hungover
Can watch this for
"Congratulations to Eagles you're greatest of all time from Philadelphia Eagles, Bad news is Kansas City Chiefs the worst player men's ever seen lame"
I never get tired of looking at this. Go birds!
Eagles = I don't always win the Super Bowl but when I do I win against a dynasty!
What i also loved about this superbowl was that everyone said if we do win its only gonna be about saqoun but he didnt even do anything
What kind of sports it is
April... still exciting!
"Seriously. I come back and watch this probably every few weeks when I see some interview or people hating on the Eagles, or an IG clip of a great play. IDK, it soothes the soul for me!"
I was so happy to watch the Chiefs play a game without seeing Taylor Swift after every other play
1:14 complete bogus call. Everyone in the world thought the refs were going to steal this game like they had done for many many before it that year.
cant stand this nerd ref with the glasses hes ruined every game he has officiated
B T A
What a great game the world knows the chiefs can't win without the refs help and they do blow
"As a Chiefs fan, this was horrible to watch. But I have to hand it to the Eagles their Defense was on fire. They had Mahommie running for his life. The Chiefs must fix the o line to win another Super Bowl."
"Great game by both teams! The Chiefs' defense was outstanding, but the Eagles' resilience kept it exciting till the end. What a showdown!"
Here in mid April! Anybody stopped watching after 40-6?
Tom Brady idk whats worse ur loss to us or ur commenting
Eagles have had off Games over history same as every team in the league. Eagles are nothing special...
This game will always make me smile no matter how old it gets
Bro was 5/11 24 yards 2 INTs at 8:22
BY FAR ONE OF THE GAYEST AND LAMEST SUPER BOWLS THERE EVER BY FAR!!!
Phi TD 2:46 Phi Interception Return TD 6:11 Phi Interception 8:12 Phi TD 8:34 Phi Long TD Hurts to Devonta Smith ROLL TIDE! 13:03
14:36 Devante Smith scored a very hard touchdown that shouldve been easily intercepted
"Bruh, the Eagles crushed you guys when you had the best season ever. Looks like those refs werent there lol"
The celebration was kind of bad and all the cameras kinda ruined it no one lives in the moment man but congrats eagles you trashed them
Watched this at least 30 times
Fly Eagles Fly!
Greetings my babies
super bowl... season wanted to see more of u.... Manchester
I'm watching this in April and I still love it!
Refs literally gave this game to the Eagles like they always do.....
Over 9.5 mill view is insane.
8:38 #32 gave up on life
It's honestly unreal we smoked them boys like that! With that being said I've always believed in Jalen Hurts
When it was 34-0 my homie walked in my house and said your looking at your TV like you just watched the second tower just got hit
Yessir back again baby fly eagles fly!!
Yeah that touchdown to Smith in the 3rd quarter was the dagger!
Mahomes had more passing yards to Cooper Dejean than his own teammates in the 1st half
How satisfying was this moment 16:13 for everyone thats not a chiefs fan even after 2 months?
7:19 bro what the chiefs glaze the score is 17-0
"Today is April 10, 2025 NFL fires three top referees that oversaw controversial Kansas City Chiefs victories during Super Bowl run"
It's great that the chiefs lost The Eagles were great...
As a Ravens fan I enjoyed watching the chiefs get destroyed
Revisiting in April. Rest in Cope mahomes stans
"What many people fail to realize is that the joy from this result is a reaction to all the damage and tampering ROGER GOODELL has done to this fantastic game. Liberals destroy everything they touch. Tons of fans are still leaving which equates to more commercials and other desperate ways ( gambling ? ) of getting more money to compensate for the incompetence. RGoodell- Badsmell ,apparently has the same stature as Caesar, untouchable. Why are the owners so afraid of him ? He needs to be FIRED- yesterday !"
Thanks Eagles (from a Bills fan)
Jim Johnson is smiling up in heaven the way this defense played
Great Super Bowl!!!!!!
6:15 the best moment in football history
Jalen hurts it least do something please
WOOW THE 2 FREE KICKS MY GOD THEY HAVE TOO BE AT LEAST TOP 10 EVER IN THE UEFA
Jalen Carter really took out everyone's frustrations with the chiefs in that one moment..
Yeah https://youtube.com/shorts/_ZgEmxqd-x0?feature=shared
What a season. What a flip from Skinny Batman to the ref after that incredible TD. Perfectly into his raised touchdown arms!!!!
Haven't seen this since broncos vs seahawks
Nah
So sad! I still have not gotten over that SB game!
Still coming back for the spanking.
Probably the weakest defensive team to make it to the Superbowl.
should've shown Taylor more this game
I said this would happen. But noooo I was the crazy one huh?
"Real talk. I'm a Eagles fan, I live there for almost 30 years"
"Whos still watching this in April? As a Bills fan, I cant get enough of this!"
Eagles would be the new team to dominate for years to come. They have it all on their plate and this was just a taste of it. Jalen Hurts is that guy youre just watching the beginning of it.
I gotta go to bed in 20 minutes. Guess Ill watch this again for the 59th time.
"If youre a bills fan, we did this for you too. and your time will come"
Cant believe this is already 56 days ago
"As a Chiefs fan, I have to say that it's frustrating. I watched this team be terrible for literal decades. The Chiefs have been a franchise for sixty six years and have nine playoff wins, most of them before I was born, in that sixty six years outside of a guy named Patrick..... Yet, the narrative is that the league is rigged towards us. Thanks guys, thanks for taking the first good decade we've had since the 1960s and then suggesting we're only good because we're cheating....."
I mean we all know that the eagles ARE BETTER THAN THE CHEIFS!!!
Mahomes throwing three TDs after they already lost was such a Chiefs thing to do. Yea we got absolutely bent over in front of the world in that Super Bowl but Mahomes added 3 to his Super Bowl TD total hehe.
As a life long Eagles fan.. this was the best thing ever.
Chiefs didnt belong on the same field at all. Barely scraped by in their wins all year long and the reasons for that became glaringly obvious in New Orleans
As a lions fan thank god the chiefs didnt win
The Eagles won't have a dynasty. But they are so good here. The defensive line won this for them.
to hear Brady's voice disappear through the game make me like him a hell lot more... he enjoys this game soo much...we should make him an honorary Eagles XD
10:18 & 10:51 - is where Justin Herbert would get sacked.
My favorite part was mahomes getting punched in the fayce to finish the game for real.
Was having a sht day.. All better :-)
Eagles knew they'd have to endure an entire album about travis if the cheifs won and they were not about to let that happen go birds
"Looking back at the highlights of this game, looks a lot like Vegas to me."
I don't really follow NFL that much. Can someone explain why people think KC Chiefs losing is so satisfying? Did they had some drama in the past?
And Tom Brady is still smiling till this day!
seeing mahomes get decked gives me so much life
GOOOO BIRDSSSSSS
HIT TO THE HEAD UPSTAIRS
"Is Hurts elite? Throws a 60 yard pass that sails perfectly into Davante Smith's bread basket to stomp on the Chiefs' throats in the SB... Ya, I'd say he's elite."
"How does Jalen Hurts, a non mobile QB not have trouble with Chris Jones"
I agree no team should win 5 wrings in row un less it's fixed
"The NFL has the worst referees in all sports. A referee should be fined for every wrong call (including ""marginal"" and ""overkill"" ones.)"
i'm still watching this months later FLY EAGLES FLY
"Im choosing this platform on YouTube to say good by to united states. My heart is with the Vikings but because of political situation I am choosing to, no longer follow my favorite team for about 34 years,and not missing a game, Dennis Green start is also my start. I even have a tattoo of the helmet Crest. So, by.. until we meet again Adios, au revoir, auf wiedersehen 'til then And though it's always sweet sorrow to part You know you'll always remain in my heart. Here's a wish and a prayer And now 'til we meet again..NFL and everything american. Also have you ever noticed the only time people say first and formost I want to thank God for my ability is only when they win an award and on nation TV. Your being brainwashed.."
Love my eagles who watches this every other week after super bowl
"It's April, and I'm still watching this. GO BIRDS!"
If the turf wasnt slippery the first SB match up wouldve went this way too.
If u seen closely Isiah peacho was wide every time and mahomes did not pass to him
13:06 I literally dropped a tear.
"13:03 Now the Eagles get it back, theyre gonna run some clockor maybe just throw the dagger? HURTS GOING DEEP! FOR IT ALL! DEVONTE SMITH!!! HE! HAS! GOT IT!!!! TOUCHDOWN!!!!"
Thats inpressive the chiefs got 22 points in a quarter it took eagles 3 quarters to get 40 points but Im eagles fan
Dominance!
what a joy to watch to overrated queefs get exposed and owned and the refs weren't there to assist them either!!
nick didnt cry at the national anthem safe to say he learned & grew as a coach
Corrections : Coopers pick 6 and Barklys catch where he flipped his body near the end zone ..
"All the Eagles did was exceptional (1) Coop pick (2) interception catch of Baun where he has to stretch his arms to catch the ball (3) the bomb from Jalen to near the end of goal line forgot his name(4) 5 sacks (5) the bomb from Jalen to Smith touchdown , these are so amazing things not ordinarily and some little small things that made Eagles champion , fun to watch Sirianni screaming running and the 2 doing sb dance I watch these maybe 70 x cant get enough congrats to everyone , blessings .. til next SB"
"34 - 0 was the true score of this SB. Fly, Eagles Fly."
The real Eagles. The Forgotten Dynasty: Scranton Eagles Football https://youtu.be/rtsEwkPlCzg?si=Oz6nj3HdN5D7ETMe
Takeover
"Kermit was looking at the refs like "" ok guys,here is where you usually screw Philly over""."
The deep ball to Smith sealed the game. Everyone in the stadium was thinking run. But no..
2:14
Patrick got sack and tackle multiple times
13:13 when the cheifs forget to pay the refs
"The Eagles have won 2 SBs, against the goat quarterbacks. Let that sink in."
Eagles fans are funny. Talking about firing Siriani and the coaching staff now they blowing the whole squad
Which super bowl is it the 2022 the 2024 is on the 2025
Life is good
4:24 nobody expected that interception
one of the most satisfying games ever
HISTORY in the making EAGLES 1:10
"Chiefs may have lost, but they did what no other team could do all season which was contain Barkley"
I dont remember ever seeing a superbowl where both teams are visitors but it sounds like a home game for one team. It's like everyone bought a ticket just to cheer for the eagles. I really hope this win makes the AFC step up and keep the chiefs from going to the Superbowl.
tbh i dont think anyone enjoyed that more than tb12
"Mahomo isnt even better then drew brees, Montana, manning, Allen, Marino, let a lot Brady. Cheating fraud"
"Cheifs are cheaters and frauds, robbed the 9ers of two rings"
eagles won the ball eagles won the ball
Im a chiefs fan
Nice
NUMBER ONE #1 DEFENSE -PHILADELPHIA EAGLES!!!
"Didn't he play quarterback for the Green Bay, Packers? Or am I mistaking him for the long term Green Bay Packers Quarterback Brett Farve (4)? ""or the long term"" Defensive End Muhammed-Kabeer Olarewaju Gbaja-Biamila Sr. (94)?"
Did Aaron Rodgers Coach the Eagles during the Superbowl (19.17 (minutes:seconds))?
"Ignore ""ALL"" YOUTUBE ADS"
I can watch these highlights over and over again Thanks again Philly. We hate Kansas City Cheaters
at 3:13 isn't that a false start on the chefs
st brown is the best ever
Watching this again to pick me up. Mahomes looked like Kyler Murray (albeit a couple inches taller) scurrying around in circles when his go-to receivers are blocked. So gratifying.
A dog walk if I ever seen one
Two beat downs in 4 yrs. Mahomo is no goat
I'm missing football
Bears 40 vs eagles 13 nfc Champions game
"This highlight just brings me so much joy, therapist should use this as a tool to alleviate depression."
The SuperBowl where both QBs played for the same team
Who could have predicted the cheifs wouldn't cross the 50 yrd line until 3rd and fourth quarter with the better record and eagles those boys were eating no one in the line under 6'6 they could put the food away
Embarrassed those losers
He little boyed him
Go Jalen
Ngl I was not expecting this to be a blow out
What the hell is going on???
Back again to see it
Defensive Sequence starting at 5:50 is insane
Been an eagles fan over 20 years this was the greatest eagles team Ive ever seen
"""I am a gorilla... I am flowers, animals... I am nature. Koko loves Man. Koko loves the Earth. But Man is stupid... Koko cries. Fix the Earth! Help the Earth! Nature is watching you... Thank you.""

6:11 is the reason why youre here
I've never seen a team get slaughtered like KC.
FLY EAGLES FLY
It's March 24th and I just watched this for the eighteen-hundred-thousandth* time. We still the Super Bowl Champions
Machokemes choked a lot in that game
Making money?
"High School = 1996 - 2000/'96 - '00?, After..? They have them too."
"Will probably do the natural, or usual? Boo P, Thomas?"
Foot?!
Shanita(s?)
Samanta(s?)
"Family, Male cousin(s?)"
Taylor Swift being booed really was the cherry on top. Chiefs fans deserved this.
KC wasnt hungry.
Demetrismcelroy1041 do you remember me
The Chiefs' first postseason loss since the 2021 AFC Championship game.
The reason why Kansas City got the points that they did because Philadelphia put their second string players in and that's bad
I thought my home was the best in the NFL so now we see he's not the best Philadelphia eagles is the best
This will forever be proof to why Mahomes is not a HOFer. Hurts really gave him the Brady beatdown.
Here I am again watching this before I go to church . Go Eagles!!!
This gotta be my favourite game of all time
LETS GO DIRTY BIRDS LETS GO DIRTY BIRDS
13:00 it was at this moment the Chiefs knew there was no way.
The Super Bowl sucked this year. I hope Super Bowl 2026 is a close game .
Then with that statement tom brady technically didn't win that many times...
Tom Brady shut up
Total domination. Reid kept his starters in late to get junk points.
What makes this Super Bowl even better is that I get for the rest of my life to comeback and watch these highlights and the sweetest part is that 85% of the highlights are the eagles.
That man Hurts made play after play. Even the INT he threw was NOT a bad INT. It put the Chiefs on the 4 yard line or so. It was like a good punt. The Eagles as a whole played their heart out. But Hurts definitely made some very important plays.
"To this day, I still can't get past the fact that only one team turned up to play. You just can't take one game for granted in the NFL..Because one game can make you or break you."
https://youtube.com/shorts/qcf9JChMV9k?si=_Z4kbt7hK5a__Fz_ Bunch of whimps
Im glad the eagles beat the bricks out of the chiefs by more than 2 touchdowns to make sure the refs didn't have a chance to save them
top14>nfl
Coming bacc to say fucc the chiefs
Being from the uk. Is this every play in order across the whole game of just the best bits...?
I wil forever be an Eagles fan after stopping the least deserved 3peat of all time
"Its crazy, ion think i seen Andy Reid the whole game"
How dis already a month ago
The final score of this one will never do any justice. KC might as well have gotten shut out.
I dont like that call one bit.. I dont like that one either. -Tom Brady
Patrick threw 3 TDS and two 2-pt conversions. He actually had better stats than Hurts.
Chiefs are the worst team to play in the Superbowlso much for Mahomes being the GOAT .
The Kansas City Chiefs will never win another NFL game. EVER.
Mahomes was past the line of scrimmage 14:12
I know some are going to mess with me about this but its March 20th 2025 and im still watching SB highlights and now and then I'll watch the whole SB game . 40yrs of being a diehard Eagles fan..
"This game, to me, felt like Superbowl 50. And I'm a Denver fan!"
Thank you Baun too for stretching your arm to catch that interception
"Mahoney was sick of being sacked several times , so he throw the ball not knowing Cooper was waiting for it .. really fun , luv it"
"Da Vonta was so super impressive , like a suspense will he catch the ball ? Wow ..he did ..Jalen was super too .."
Love that touchdown dance wished they perform more longer impressive
"Yes Elliot was 100 % and perfect , super too"
"Yes that pick six was indeed a super drama , congrats Coop on your 22 birthday , blessings keep up the super job and continue to be humble"
Siriani instead of Soriano why you keep changing my word ?
Siriani instead of Soriano why you keep changing my word ?
Be humble instead of be bumble ?
Is it not that defensive Eagles coordinator going to another team
"Seems my Alma mater , my first job was an RN at Thomas Jefferson University hosp. downtown , Philadelphia , now I am eagle fan next to Texan"
"I watched this game 60x SB 59 , its just unbelievable performance of Eagles ,every one performed super .. God bless Eagles be bumble .love everyone congrats Eagles . Soriano Hurts and all .."
Brady saying the throw of his life then saying dagger again kind of ruined it.
The Eagles goSs going to Super Bowls
Cooper is not a safety. Hes just a corner who locked down your number one.
And that's why you make sure there's enough money in the account before you go writing a check to the refs. Mahomes didn't get that memo.
Chiefs got absolutely destroyed I've never seen the chiefs under Andy Reed look this bad
TOP 10 BEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE
tom brady havin nightmares from 2017
1:31 NO PASS INTERFERENCE NONE
"Exactly , cant get enough of the pick 6 of Cooper , touchdowns , all the interceptions and sacks on Mahomes, wow this is super , luv it congrats Eagles"
I watch this every night before bed. I sleep like a baby! #gobirds
KC Fans: Were the best! How is it rigged! KC Fans: We lost its RIGGED!!!
"Can we take a moment to realize this game was nowhere close from the start, and kc was overrated all year and only got there because of the rigged calls all season..and got absolutely destroyed by the eagles in every aspect of this game completely."
"Well, being a Steeler fan and not having a decent coach......this video is my go to, to feel good."
This game reminded me of Super Bowl 48.
Thank you for that Eagles. Lovely lovely perfect game.
I come back every so oftenbrings a smile to my face
"5:51 - 6:27....Game defying sequence. 2 sacks, int, touchdown."
"*If you told me that the Chiefs would score the last 16 points of Super Bowl LIX and Saquon Barkley would rush for only 57 yards on 25 carries, an average of 2.3 yards with a long of 10 yards.I would say Wow! I cant imagine how bad the Chiefs beat the Eagles in a game like that. I wouldve never believed it was the other way around under those circumstances.*"
"Every chief fan should be humbled for this, youre not the the best in the NFL, in fact youre not even close to #1"
1:00
10th time rewatching
F. K. C.
First time watching NFL and trying to understand the game after watching Kendrick's show
Watching the Eagles lose this game was the greatest night of my life! Thank you KC for blowing them out!
I feel like Im watching this every other day
Nah they ran out of money to pay refs bc they use it on the whole season!
Lost track of how many times Ive seen this on repeat @16:00
Hope cooper Dejean had a good brithday
"https://youtu.be/-rOmWIERvzo?t=939 quote KB: he will never buy another cheese steak again, I promise you that"
"It will""Never"" get old!"
It will necer get old! Born in Philly! They showed America what they are made of! Will love them forever!
The Chiefs and Eagles delivered an unforgettable Super Bowl showdownwhat a game! Both teams showed incredible skill and determination.
If only the Patriots had been blown out like this in a Super Bowl.
Eagles are the Best no more of the refs Chiefs forgot to pay the refs
"March 16th, 2025 I'm enjoying watching these highlights for about the 10th time"
Im an Eagles fan and Im still watching it in march
KC weeping wuwuwuwuwu
"As a lifetime Broncos fan, this was the most fun Ive had on Super Bowl Sunday since SB50."
*THANK YOU GOD FOR A SCORELESS HALF FROM KC*
"Never seen Brady get thoroughly _humiliated, beaten, demolished, reduced to atoms, vaporized, rofl stomped, esamaculared, pussified_ like this in a super bowl..."
Kansas City Jersey is now in the Philadelphia Eagles Stadium where no one can find it they will be jinxed for the rest of the NFL career thanks to my dawg
It didnt even look like the Chiefs were trying. Definitely not competing for their third Super Bowl in a row.
"Who else is back for their weekly dose? Ill start by saying, I"
I'm just here rewatching the worst game in nfl history looking for who to blame.
One of the 7 officials stop at the 7 of them were still playing for Kansas City on the first Philadelphia drive on that pass interference call
I turn 30 on Sunday. Seeing my Eagles beat the Chiefs in a Super Bowl rematch was my present. Seeing my Eagles win 2 Super Bowls in my lifetime against some of the best teams in football is even better. GO BIRDS!!
This is what the refs get for helping the chiefs
Don't let the final score deceive you; this game was *much* more dominant than the score showed
"I was in Philly watching this live, words truly cannot describe how quickly I lost my voice while viewing this game"
"Heres a fun fact that not many NFL fans know: This was Kareem Hunts first postseason game that he didnt score a touchdown in, he scored in all six of his other playoff games, so now the only NFL player (off the top of my head and non-qb) to score a touchdown in each of their postseason games is Damien Williams"
one of the most boring super bowls I have ever seen
You will find mysterious information about NFL games in this video. https://youtu.be/CAaaMx2dE9w?si=qOSlrAp7NpiLxMPD
This wouldnt have happened if the Chiefs would just punt on 3RD DOWN!!
The Venmo from the Chiefs didnt go through.
Mahomes was used and abused by that Philly's mean Defense
Philly's D was freaken mean
"Coopers pick 6 was the highlight of the night for me. My reaction was just; Oh, my God! And my dad was just laughing in disbelief"
The eagles defense watched the buccaneers superbowl highlights against the chiefs and saw how simple it could be to keep him scrambling for answers.
what a glorious night!
What is this game man ????!????
The Eagles saved democracy.
As a RAIDER fan I approve this
Will the chiefs losing a Super Bowl before gta 6
No 3 peat
As an Eagles fan.. I cannot tell you how many times Ive watched this
Im a niners fan and I know weve had heartache but I could watch this all day
"As a latin american dude, i will never understand the meaning of this sport xD ... Come on guys you need to see real football"
"I never could've thought that Jalen Hurts could win a Super Bowl. People been doubting him this whole time. Been saying he can't throw, can't read a defense, system qb, etc. His story is the stuff dreams are made of. Jalen is a great qb. He made some big time throws in the Super Bowl. Jalen is a winner and has a talented team around him. Philadelphia Eagles wouldn't have gone anywhere had it not been for Jalen Hurts. I have seen major progression in his game since his days at Oklahoma and now in the NFL. Give all the props to this young man because he balled out. Jalen Hurts will continue to have a successful career for the next 10-15 years he probably will continue playing for. Give him maybe 5-6 more rings because I really like this qb. This is after watching many highlight films of this guy because he really is the real deal."
The Chiefs wanted to play within their offensive game plan. Throw that out the window and just let Mahomes play off schedule.
Watching Mahomes run for his life brings me so much joy
6:13 lol who was he trying to even pass to
Wtf is this game
The Bucs showed how to beat the Chiefs. Pressure hard and win by mid throws.
I LOVED when Kelce started yelling in the Eagles face trying to get them to react or push him and they stood like STATUES
The NFL shut everyone up about cheating....but they care about money so it won't go away. Dollar bills y'all.
Eagles defense needs a trophy
If there was any Super Bowl where you could award the MVP to an entire D-line it was this one. Mahomes may have ran for 200+ yards horizontally.
I could rewatch these highlights over and over again. So good.
I wonder how Taylor Swift feels about dating a looooser
Trying to understand this sport all I concluded was you lot wrestle with a ball in hand
I hate being a chiefs fan.
Look how the ref caught the toss from Devonta Smith 13:12
I cant even lie I cant stop watching this 2023 & 2024 hasnt been the greatest for me but this victory here made some of the stress go away! GOD is amazing !! GOD Ble33 everyone!!!
Who else is re-watching this beautiful performance by them boys
Maybe Mahommes didn't pay the refs enough this time lol
5:17 BRO STOP REFS
I was there
"ALLEGEDLY: ""TWO SQUADS, OF ELEVEN MEN EACH SAYS IT ALL, Y, ITALY WHAT BIG IDEAS THOSE THAT LOST THEIR 2025 SUPERBOWL BETS HAD, AS THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW THE OUTCOMES, OF ONLY TWO SQUADS, IN MILITARY MEASURES, WITHOUT VARIETIES, OF TERRAINS, WITH NEARLY ONE SEASON, YEAR, OF INSTANT REPLAYS STUDIES, ET CE TERRA......"""
The future of the NFL is saved
"The Eagles D line nicknamed Maholmes, ""groceries"". That's because he got sacked so much."
40-6 ***
Bored
When it was 34-0 all I can think about is Shannon Sharp being on the phone Hello Mr. president? Send back up now!
1 month since
"I was thinking about the Eagles will take a third Super Bowl champs against to the Rams for a black nation, Philadelphia Eagles"
Refs got paid
Yeah and referees needs penalized Patrick
Eagles came back with a vengeance....
13:00
I feel like pat just towed it to cooper
LETS DO A REPEAT EAGLES AND CHIEFS ONE MORE TIME WE ARE THE TEAM THAT REPRESENTS OUR LIFE IN PHILLY WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR KINGDOM TO EAGLE KINGDOM THIS TIME THE PHILLY PHILLY DYNASTY WILL LIVE FOREVER #Eagles #SuperBowl60
NOW THE FACT THAT CHIEFS LOST WAS TERRIBLE AND THE EAGLES GOT THE TROPHY BUT THE CHIEFS TRIED AND EAGLES FANS THAT ARE HAPPY FOR THE EAGLES AND THE CHIEFS FANS ARE SAD EVEN ME BUT IM SURE THEY WILL WIN NEXT TIME ALSO ADD THIS TO TOP COMMET AND HOPE IT GETS LIKES
Watched this 200 times and Ill watch it 200 more
I love the eagles
The front four for phillys defense. True MVPs. All of them.
One month later... the Philadelphia Eagles are STILL Super Bowl 59 Champions!
How come winning teams don't bring back the exact line up? If it's not broke...you know the rest
The stupidest game I have ever seen.
I'm not upset about the results. Jalen hurts and saquon Barkley truly deserve it.
When ironman finally beat thanos
Still watching!!! GO BIRDS!!!
Big game by eagles defense
This was Bucs chiefs part 2
15:40 Tom: Uh-oh!
"And to think, Homes thought they would come back, because the Pats did. He needs a CT scan thinking that."
CHEIFS are done cuz the eagles believe in god
Anyone else notice the forward lateral pass by Patrick in the 3rd qtr. at 1:19 and got away with it? I think our backup QB would have played the entire 4th quarter if the refs picked that one up. Plane as day
Chiefs shouldve won the superbowl
One of if not the best nights of my life.
THE CHIEFS DEFENSE IS SLOW AND VERY UNORGANISED
This rivalry is bout to be INSANE
Halftime show is more watched than this game lol
Eagles FLY in Super Bowl 59! Gets me every time
Never gets old rewatching this!!
"The linemans of Eagles are so tough and fast, they penetrated through in 2 seconds, the QB didn't get any chance. The recievers are better too. Just better all around."
So satisfied to see chiefs get beat up
But but the white jerseys are good luck
Mahomes was definitely pass the line of scrimmage when he tossed it to travis
I ain't seen a Mahomes State Farm commercial ever since
this was so fun to watch. 0-34 was peak television
This is the moment the chiefs lost the super bowl
"This season hit so differently. I thought 52 would never be topped...59 said, 'HOLD MY CHEESESTEAK AND YUENGLING AND GO BIRDS!"" We got something truly special in Eagles Nation."
The best Revenge SUPER BOWL OF ALL TIME MY BIRDS WON !!!
Who else is watching this for like the 1000th time
Hater's are owned by SATAN!!!!
"Who is this horrible commentator? Ertz gets slammed in the head and he just says ""I don't like that one either"""
Crazy how Kendrick played not like us and the chiefs were losing and then after the halftime show the chiefs were down even more
Decked
18:10 65 yard throw?! Pretty cool. I'm a Commanders fan so have to compare it to the 69 yard hail mary against Chicago.
I love that Travis Kelce doesn't even appear in this highlight until 12:43.
You disappointed KC
"Very happy with Eagles kicker. He had one job to do and he did it. All season he was giving me heartburn ...But, he showed up when it really mattered."
That ref in this super bowl a chiefs fan you can tell he tried everything he could to keep the Chiefs vin this game.
"Anyone else still watching the highlights in March? Oh, still so much joy watching the Eagles decimate the Chiefs!"
I called the Chiefs the Kansas City cheaters
So after 5 superbowls in the 2020s we got 2 clunkers and 3 classics.
I watch this continually to 34 -0 .....cause that's when it was really over
*all of the dislikes were from Kansas City Chiefs and all their fans*
I keep rewinding the moment Mahomes got murdered at 15:45 smh
"The refs are one thing, but this was the first time the Chiefs faced a team that outmatched them at every single position."
that shovel pass to kelce should have been a forward lateral
Wasn't for Jaylun first int.... its a complete shut out!!! Chiefs had no business here...one refs help wasn't enough
this is the way
40-6 . Chiefs were total frauds all year. When the refs don't hand you 7 wins it's hard to compete. Eagles are gonna be a problem the next few years. They are scary good
4th. Time watching this go birds
Imagine you have the chance for a 3peat but get blown out so hard the other team puts the backup QB in. How utterly embarassing.
EAGLESSSSS
Watching that last smack on Mahomes to this day (like a month ago) makes me want to call the police
I'm so glad my friend has this game downloaded for me to watch ad free.
Howie! Howie! Howie!
Finish the sentence: The eagles won the bowl
"The last Eagles touchdown, one of the Eagles cheerleaders kicked the extra points. Lol"
Nice work Patrica Mahommes
Hi yall i want to get into football what are yall favorite teams?
Not a birds fan even though i live in philly but ive got a ton of respect for that team. You've earned that sb championship and thanks for putting chiefs in their place. Im sure most nfl fans would agree. Team and the fans deserved this sb win
"Never in my life have I ever been happier to see a team lose, watched this at least 20 times"
BTA
KC got destroyed by my Eagles ) and I live in Missouri so it's even better )
It took me 3 weeks to watch this because I've been celebrating The Eagles Fly as the 2024-2025 Superbowl Champions #jalenhurts for the Win. #mvp You did it. I knew y'all would What a Blow out. Cheers Happy Solar Return Sequon Barkley and Cooper DeJean with the Pick 6 Jalen Carter You're an NFL Champion forever Fly Eagles Fly
Long day? Things not going your way? Key this up and skip to the Mahome's sack fumble smack down.
Go birds
Lmao look how the ref catches the ball at 13:12
Should have been Bills-Eagles..
crazy how most of the chiefs points are against the second string
I'm visiting NOLA #popeyesCHK
this is my 5th time watching this game
The Eagles are happy about that Super Bowl victory
0-34 eagles in the 3rd quarter
This was the greatest hatewatch of all time
F. K. C.
"Philly gets ALL the credit (and deservedly) for dominating, but here three weeks later it is Reid's absolute inability to adjust KC's game plan that baffles me. Philly's D-line was feasting on the drop back. EVERY TIME. Mahomes is looking at zone. EVERY TIME. The Eagles were just THAT GOOD. But a coaching staff on the opposite side has to take their opponent's strengths and do things to neutralize them. KC coaches did nothing. This SB will be remembered for Andy Reid's no-show."
Philadelphia Eagles
boring af
Crazy that the eagles defense wasnt even blizting mahomes insane
"Man, Fox was not messin around with that font! That is the biggest blockiest font I think I've ever seen! They're not blowin any money on frills because this will probably be one of the last SB's that will be on broadcast TV. They had a good run."
Cooper dejean is not a safety hes just a corner who will lock down your number one
That aj call was bad
5:49 Look at how slow Kelce is to the snap and completely lets Sweat blow past him for the easy sack
6 SACKS PUT IT ON AN F-IN T-SHIRT!
Refs gave the chiefs a ring two years ago and Eagles got it back
Eagles Walk off the field and 6 plays later the chiefs score
Eagles paid the Refs button
Glorious! I NEVER want to hear again any of the idiotic comparisons between Brady the GOAT and Patrick The Wannabe! Ha-ha-ha-ha.
I was a hurts hater all year i can admit I was wrong that man balled tf out when it ment the most hes got true heart of a eagle.
"The mindset of the officials was plain to see: they started the game on a, not marginal, but bad call, recognizing the urgent need to even the score, they called the head shot on Goedert to even the score, then allowed the players to decide the game most evident by the no call on Carter on the 6th sack."
The eagle win
5:40 it barely didnt make it
My EAGLES are now Americas team now got that cowgirls there's a new sheriff in the NFL. Average age of 25 this is going to be a great 5 more seasons with a three peat.
how bout them chiefs
15:44 MEDIC!!!
Still watching this and still smiling
19:10 EAGLES FLY IN SUPERBOWL 59
I LOVE THIS SH-T!
Still seeing the highlight reel on my feed and I watch every single time and it will never get old! Thank u for delivering an iconic season until next time !! R.I.P Mahomes career after this !!!
15:44 ((( Jalen Carter TKO
When the half-time music concert is more popular than the game.
F$$K A Trick
"Stay strong, play hard, win big Me: Still celebrating. #Go Birds"
I think this is the best game in our EAGLES history. TOTAL DOMINATION!
The fact that it was a blowout gives it lower views Eagles dominated!
I love seeing Patrick Mahomes getting hit by Jalen Carter! Whew!
From quaters 1-4 I could tell the Eagles were the more hungry team they were playing very aggressive chiefs had no answers for that its rare a team bullies the chiefs like this felt like buccaneers vs chiefs Super Bowl
EAGLES ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!!! Lets go
why kc sooo weak
what game is this rugby better
7:30 why would they do that there losing at 17 and 0 they need to be humble
Anyone else watched this 20+ times and its still February?
"glad the eagles won. need to shut up all 30million KC bandwagon fans, and show that Patrick ISN'T the GOAT. ... it's Montana. the REAL GOAT"
The Eagles are an amazing team.
Bradys problem is he doesnt talk enough
Revenge momente
The Eagles taking down another dynasty. Never gets old.
The Chiefs did a BRILLIANT job of stopping Barkley on the ground! Defensive master class!
"Life cycle of chief: win super bowl 1 times, get dominated the next one, win 2 more, get dominated again, repeat."
The Kelce family would like you to know that getting boosted and listening to Swift music helps with depression.
"I wish the Chiefs had gone undefeated up to this point, would have been so much sweeter"
a horrible sport for real
Idc what anybody says the Maddox play on 4th down was the turning point. I know the eagles were up big but keeping momentum was key and that play did it.
Noone talks about how well Barkley played It didnt show in the stat sheet tho Look at his pass protection pickup That was elite
Bruh that kid cooper degean man hes a rookie and thats inpresive to me
"See you next year.Rodgers goes back to the packers and might win one vs the ravens or jaguars in the superbowl.Lamar knocks on the door and finally opens up a superbowl oppurtunity for his team and wins it all.The Jaguars draft malacki starks Safety and gets garrett wilson wr then goes to the superbowl.Its a 3 team shot at the superbowl the Jaguars,Ravens,and Packers what a world we live in."
"10:18 Hurts' ""Spidey sense"" takes over."
"Tom Brady doesn't even have to be playing, Mahomes can't win a post-season with him in the building"
4th time watching
Man this was satisfying to watch.
Back again to watch this beauty!!
How about showing the whole game?
Crazy game
Ive legit watched this a 100 times. Greatest Eagles team ever what a performance
There was no feeling like being in Philly for the Superbowl win and then the parade after that master class of a game
Its funny hearing the Announcers trying to get excited about ANYTHING Mahomes does
The quarterback from the Chiefs is so bad
I will forever come back to these highlights & relive this day. #GoBirds
8:02 hell yeah
DECKED!!!
"Here's the thing. Whether you hate them or love them, the Eagles were a team of underdogs, many of whose best plays were made by new drafts or recruits from teams that didn't want them, and they still beat the 'best' team in the league. Not only beat, but demolished. Fly Eagles fly!"
Viewing guide for Chiefs fans: 1. Start at 13:53 2. Crop the screen so the scoreboard is invisible 3. Enjoy the blowout win
not today Mahomes!
TDL
The way the Eagles' defense dominated the Chiefs was amazing.
Crazy how people think tbis game is rigid and Im an eagles fan. KC is that good. People are too easy too convince nowadays thats why we voted a fascist in the oval office
Fly Eagles Fly I will remember this for the rest of my life
Bundle-a-rooooooooskie
Championships have to be won on their own its a rule
KCs run is done. They wont be back on top anytime soon. Real dynasties are rare.
I dont even think it would be a game vs the rams. AFC needs some physicality. wrecked
"American football is weak af, we all know that rugby is better and more physical"
"In the 3rd, at 1:19, when Mahomes made that shuffle pass to Kelsey, it should have been blown dead, since he was past the line of scrimmage..."
"I'm glad the Eagles won this Super Bowl. They deserved to, they absolutely showed up and showed out in the playoffs and none of their games were close. They whupped everybody!"
Score line flatters chiefs
Still watching every day!!
crazy the Eagles defensive coordinator was pissed they gave up any points in the 2nd half. Gotta play every down.
22 mercy points
1:46 arguably a first down could have changed the whole game
This game felt like varsity vs junior varsity
Kansas dropped the soap
Glad to see the the Chiefs beaten down!
"Taylor sucked off not only Kelce, but the entire Eagles defence"
Fact is the Chiefs are a better team than the Eagles and I dont see that changing any time soon
Glad the Eagles Obliterated The Chiefs. Go Birds.
CAN ANYONE HERE EXPLAIN THIS SPORT TO ME WHAT IS HAPPENING??!!
So this is what they say it's better than world cup
Besides us getting our second ring off stopping another 3peat. I loved how Wentz wouldn't shake the hand of the man who took his job lol. FLY EAGLES FLY
tommy boi is a dweeb.
This is the day Philly had been waiting for for almost 100 years
The refs could not save the Chiefs.
14:11 Anybody else notice that Mahomes was past the line when he threw this?
"Eagles broke a lot of curses this year. Letting the Chiefs down by 10, Kirk Cousins curse, and the Chiefs away uniform in Super Bowl curse."
wtf sport ????? no sport
Kareem Hunt was barely used thats why the Chiefs lost
AH yes my 14th time watching this. Go birds.
I can watch this all day GO EAGLES!!!!
Eagles exposed the Chiefs
KC looked like they were playing scared.
.
Kc got no chance! Zero chance! Eagles
Too big to rig.
"It has been incredibly thrilling to celebrate our first Super Bowl championship. Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration. We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2025 season."""
"One of the best defensive performances of all time. Yes, I'm familiar with the 85 bears, but they weren't facing a dynasty. The 85 Patriots featured Grogan, not Brady. The Bucs D was very impressive is SB LV but they did allow 6 points in the first half. Amazing but not the same. The Chiefs had 23 yards in the first half. The Eagles had more Interception return yards than the Chiefs had TOTAL yards. The Chiefs didn't cross the 50 until the end of the 3rd quarter at 34-0. 0 blitzes. Total domination."
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS!! CAN WE GET A FOURTH?
so happy the eagles got thier long awaited super bowl win
Chiefs got exposed finally
BTA
The Ref was so lucky Henry didnt follow through on his air punch @ 9:55 lol
Chiefs fd around and got run though lol
1Q7-0 1:49 pressured & nearly intercepted 3:25 pressured 2Q24-0 5:47 sucked 5:59 sucked 6:11 pick6 6:55 sucked 8:12 intercepted 9:11 pressured 3Q34-6 9:36 sucked 9:48 sucked 9:59 pressured & scramble 11:54 pressured & scramble(Chiefs penalty) 14:06 pressured & tricky pass 14:22 pressured & TD pass 4Q40-22 15:39 sucked& turnover 16:58 pressured & pass others 13:01 47yards TD pass(Hurts) 13:52 50yards pass(Mahomes)
Yes the Eagles defense is the best and will be for years because their so young and courageous winners of the light!! Nothing can stop you when you're on Gods side!!
Can't count out the Eagles now all you nay sayers were in the mix for years to come!! Hallelujah Thanks to God!!
What do you put on a Philly pretzel?.. MUSTAAARRRDDD on the beat its a Philly thing.
Cheers for Jake Elliott

"I just love my Eagles and I am so proud of them, you did it, you won the Super Bowl and the Lombardi Trophy salute to the Eagles organization,"
15:43
Taylor swift wanted to go home during halftime
"COOPER DEJAEN IS NOT A SAFTEY, HES JUST A CORNER WHO WILL LOCK DOWN YOUR NUMBER ONE. DEJEAN IS CB1"
"KANSAS CITY CHIEFS FANS ARE, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST PATHETIC AND SHAMEFUL SOREST LOSERS WE'VE SEEN IN SOMETIME. HUMILIATED FOREVER. SINGLE WORST LOSS IN SB HISTORY. THE COPE IS HYSTERICAL."
Gotta say Chief fans are without a doubt the most pathetic and shameful sorest losers we've ever seen. Sad.
I've watched this no less than 20 times and it never gets old
Kansas city is gonna become like new England pretty soon
"The eagles flew,the swifties cried."
Game would have been better if the Chiefs played with more effort. Congratulations to the Eagles
40-22 is crasy not even a superbowl
Play action TD to smitty is 2nd best play in eagles history. I watch it every day lol
I'm not an Eagles fan but I believe the Eagles can repeat and even become a dynasty.
Hate watch was finally successful & its even sweeter bc they thought they were close for the 3 peat. Only reason why the 3-peat was even possible was preferential treatment from refs all season.
This was the greatest Superbowl I have ever seen FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
The chiefs would dove won for this who dint no but the interspetions just sold their whole game
The Kansas City chiefs shouldve gotten a whole bunch of penalties so the Philadelphia Eagles could score more touchdowns
Wasn't that shuttle pass by Mahomes over the line of scrimage?
"The one thing that I think may be overlooked about the Eagles offense is how much time they chewed off the clock handing the ball to Barkley. The fact that for the most part the Chiefs were able to ""stop"" him actually backfired against them. Because instead of Barkley breaking off 60 yard TD runs in 18 seconds, he was getting short runs that continued burning the clock the entire game. But to be honest, even if Barkley had one of his monster games, that Eagles defense was NOT giving anything to the Chiefs. Either way, kudos to the greatest football team in the world, the Philadelphia Eagles. Let's run it back. PHLY."
"What a stupid sport... ""foot""ball."
"The Chiefs win most of their Superbowls, but when they lose they lose big time."
Welcome back!
"Bro, AJ Brown has braids now? I didnt know how he got braids"
Told myself the rematch would only be interesting if it turns to a curb-stomp in the Eagles favor. And it actually happened.
"Well, now the Chiefs are VERY afraid of three teams: Buccaneers when Brady was there, BENGALS (and very very very much) and we must add Eagles. What will be the worst nightmare of the Chiefs? The very next game in Philadelphia, :)"
More commercials please!!!
Jalen deserves this won!!!!
Honestly Tom Brady is a J.A.G. as a broadcaster but his call on Devonta Smith's TD is actually A great listen not just because of the outcome..........!
Dats Dem Boyz
I think I watched this video 15 times already its been 2 weeks since we won
Mahomo the turnover machine
Congrats Philly! Fly Eagles Fly And GO PATS!
eagles play so beautiful
it says 2024 not 2025
01:21 what a joke. The refs tried
They shut down Barkley. Sure. But that opened up our pass game
6:15 Greatest pick-6 ever
"Kansas Citys my hometown, ngl seeing use lose as horribly as we did that night was a gut punch. Regardless, great job Philly. Yall deserved that win"
Lets Go Eagles!!!! love our team!!
worthy not able to celebrate ANY of his touch downs
chiefs gave one of the BEST superbowl performances AND worst lol
"As an eagles fan watching this almost 2 weeks later, I don't think it's talked about enough just his much Sirianni out coached Reid. Everything is so one sided"
Ada nggak ya orang indo...?
The eagles crushed those chiefs
"Let me say this. I myself am a Chiefs fan, but Cooper DeJean's Pick Six was one of the most beautiful things ive seen"
How people even like this sport?
BTA
From 13:00 to 13:12 the crowd got so LOUD I was HYPE!
The only team I would prefer to win the comp than the eagles is the lions
"I'm trying to learn more about how football works, can anyone tell me why at 4:33 the person who got the ball couldn't just walk backwards and touchdown?"
hurts almost hit the side arm throw
you cool
Just woke up from a coma after my brain exploded immediately following that Jalen Hurts bomb to DeVonta Smith. Awesome to finally rewatch this beatdown
"I guess were all going to pretend that Patrick Mahomes wasnt across the line of scrimmage when he did that little shovel pass to Kelce on their first scoring drive. Didnt matter, though!!! So happy my team showed how fraudulent the Chiefs were this year!"
","
"i love coming back to this every couple days, makes me happy"
What a game! Super Bowl LIX did not disappoint
I can't help it this is my 3rd time here!!!
Yep shows exactly what wouldve happened all year if the refs hadn't been saving yhem
@ball.tactics 0:04
Who cares about Superbowl? Real sport is Football World Cup
I do not like the eagles
Go chiefs
JEROMY MAURICE GREEN AKA STUNNA UNLIMITED UNIVERSE MULTIPLE TIMES UNLIMITED FREE MASONS MULTIPLE TIMES
We all knew the Eagles was going
I'm watching this whooping again!
"As a avid Eagles fan, this was beautiful to watch! Mahomes was in pure hell"
"Just one word for the match ""Awesome"""
Super Bowl LIX Eagles might beat 95 percent of teams to ever play in the NFL.
That voodoo doll women made them loose
Not even the board game SORRY itself could apologize for KC
So many awesome Eagle players but always have a favorite and for me that is Devonta Smith. One of the best!!!!
I've watched these highlights a 1000 times already! How about a shout out to Jake!? Our man showed up!
Bro somebody had a voo hoo doll of Patrick
POV: Your an eagles player winning the game of the year
"There will never be a chance for a 3 peat in the Super Bowl ever again, not with free agency and the salary cap"
This isn't a rigged game? in 6:23 (or 6:49 replay) the red player could easily catch the green one
I liked the steamed pig @ the tailgate party parade celebration--it was labelled #15
Lol back again
15:40 my personal favorite
Will be tuning into this video at least 12 times a year as a broncos fan
Lmao every highlight is strictly Eagles dominating this is what we all wanted
BTA!!! FLY FLY
Is travis kelce always been this slow?
"Yesssss, Champions Eagles"
hk traktor chelyabinsk
Jalen for next year 1. Get rid of the ball quicker on average 2. Throw more to AJ Brown
Doubt they would admit this but I think Saquon was sandbagging a little to make the Chiefs think they were containing him and keeping them from adjusting the D to a stronger pass defense.
Informative.
13:00 best offensive play of the game. Beautiful throw and catch
I thought I saw Connor stallions.At a lot of kansas city games this year! Hint hint!
EZ PZ for the
is it what u say better than wc?
The way Elliot was drilling those kicks was like a shotgun
This is the first time I've seen a superbowl game where they put in backups. This is just wild....!
It's weird the kansas city chiefs dint play like they did the last 2 years thiz was given game sold
"15, you'll be back here again. Until then let's ride this wave. So long !!"
PATRICK< YOU WILL NEVER BE TOM BRADY BRO>>> STOP TRYING>>>> seven rings dont lie>> FLY eagles FLY!! KAW KAW!
Hurts going to come back with a vengeance next year I can feel it.
"I'm Indian I don't know the rules, can you please teach me or suggest some tutorials."
34-0. GO BIRDS.
The eagles are win the super bowl
12:53 DEATH SCREAM
The second i saw the int at 4:18 i thought the cheifs were about to start deep frying the eagles but then i realized how wrong i was...
"The Philadelphia Eagles Saved the NFL..... Except for Chiefs Fans, all of America was pulling for the Eagles.....A Texans Fan Here!!!!!"
What bs
"The game was never even close. I think the whole nation was sick of the Chiefs. At least the Cincinnati Bengals did knock them off in 2021 to stop their streak but lost to the Rams, which many thought the Bengals got screwed on the game. But I was happy to see the Eagles take it"
Devontas stride is insane. Literally looks like hes jogging while Watson is running for dear life.
Cowherd summed it all up quite well the next morning.
"In the words of Shadow the Hedgehog, the Eagles wanted revenge. And they delivered."
Now its time to watch the ufl starts in march 28 2025
"CRUSHING & Humiliating Defeat of The Chief's- How 'Sweet"" it is!"
They were taken to the wood shed
Happy birthday saqoun barkley!
"I know it's only been 8 days since we won, but yeah WE DID IT, EAGLES NATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Btw I will forever be watching this highlight over and over again, it's never enough! Please like this so I can come back to this video."
Haha chief fans
D Hop had that Super Bowl td in his incintage contract forsho wasnt leaving without nun
"Bad way to get DeAndre Hopkins, his first NFL touchdown"
Everyone saying the refs didnt help.. the eagles didnt allow the refs to have a chance to impqct the game. Big defference
Gonna comment and then add a Talley mark every time I rewatch
No offense but this game look like very aggressive and inappropriate. Also the name Football seems irrelevant. It should be known as Fightball!
The penalty on the Eagles first field goal attempt was lol totally bogus! It was definitely 5 yard penalty for off sides on the Kansas City Chiefs. It should have been off sides by number (whoever) and FIRST DOWN Eagles!
Life long eagles fan since 1981 and the defensive series that ended with a Cooper Dejean Pick 6 TD had to be the best defensive series n Eagels history
For once I really wished they showed more of Taylor Swift. Wouldve loved to see her reactions as the Chiefs continued to be bullied
"Maybe if the Chiefs practiced more rather than making TV commercials they would have been in this game. ""Bundlerooskidoo!!!"""
Rewatching this again and the chiefs o line got away with so much holding their 2 tackles held just about every pass attempt and they were very clear holding calls that couldve been made
RIGGGEEEEDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like your NFL videos
Eagles win super bowl 59! WOOOOOOO
No 3 peat for chiefs.
"That defense was lit!! The whole team showed out, but that defense ate Mahomes up. Loved it."
This is the worst sport ever
Vjinfdia
Vjindia
5:15 Mannnn whatta Kick!
"19:06 are we just gonna skip the sportsmanship with the linebackers, that was was cool 19:02 ***"
Outstanding coverage! This video showcases the pivotal moments that led to the Eagles' Super Bowl triumph.
Thank you Philly
The Phillies made up for ALL the years they've made it to the SuperBowl. GREAT JOB guys!
Someone got paid to do the scoreboard graphic
Got away with the shuffle pass that was pass the line of scrimmage too
6:11
What did the Eagles do after winning the Super Bowl? They played the 2nd half.
I keep watching this over n over
All im gonna say is no team ever sat their starters to put in backups against Brady in a Super Bowl
A
The number of ad breaks in this 19 minute video is absolutely ridiculous.
Just make sure that Kaper*ick doesn't take credit
KC refs didn't get the memo!!
Looks like Patrick Mahomes forgot to send his Venmo to the refsFLY EAGLES FLY
Kelce has lost all passion for the game. Clear to see.
I wanted the chiefs to win three in a row I'm really sad refs did not cheat this time if they did they problem would have won
1

11
Oh
Baby
My name is
My name is
I cant remember any team because of blowout putting in their backup qbever.
"Hurts had a +0.51 epa/pp in this game. The highest ever in Super Bowl history. For those that have no idea what that is, like me till yesterday, that means added points expected per play. Sounds complicated, its not really. Read about, youll be amazed."
Im watching this while another browser tab playing rugby video what im doing I dunno
Hurts played the year like an Olympic runner in the 5000 meters. He saved enough for the final push to make it a sprint while leaving nothing on the table throughout the 18 week season nor the playoffs leading to the Super Bowl.
16:07 Jalen Carter bulldogs Trey Smith O.O
MN
Patrick Mahomes is goat he's been to 5 superbowl appearances we'll let hurts get his 2 appearance
"""Everyone on the Eagles defense agreed that Kelsey has the best breath ever in the NFL."""
It still feels like a dream best Sports Era in Philly sports Eagles im 68 loved and how we got here began in 98
When the peasants show up at the coronation !!!..
I heard Jamarcus Russel is in free agency
"Thats what happens when you start to believe you are as good as the bs wins youve been given all year. Thought they were untouchable, but Philly touched them up like they werent even in their level. It was embarrassing an humbling to their core. I loved every minute of it. The refs even tried early with the offensive pi but that couldnt stop the freight train battling at them helplessly tied to the tracks."
The zebras reeeeaaaly tried to swing it in that first quarter. Too much skill on Philly side tho
How did my rams put up a better fight than any other playoff team
The Scarecrow fixed the game. Mahomes and Kelce received telegrams laced with fear toxin.
No blitz no nothing to do with the D-Line just those 4 guys upfront doing there job and they end up coming with 6 sacks
Mahomes; you are not come back kid!
Blaming the refs is still diabolical The chiefs o line gave out happens all these ref blazers needa be out
6:17 - 6:25 that eight second play was so beautiful
Fun fact The Eagles lost to Brady in the Super Bowl Then the Eagles beat Brady in the Super Bowl The Eagles lost to Mahomes in the Super Bowl Did the Eagles beat Mahomes in the Super Bowl
This super bowl will go down as the greatness super bowl in 40 years
"Finally, the Lorax finally lost a Super Bowl within in years of being in the NFL!"
"Finally, the Lorax finally lost a Super Bowl in years!"
they caught zach baun calling his own number on a mic after coopers pick! baun said im a get one too
while watching it felt like there were way more than 6 sacks
"BREAKING NEWS, PATRICK MAHOMES HAS BROKE UP WITH THE REFS"
"As an eagle fan, Im glad we won this game, but the hate is unreal for the Chiefs. All yall doing is fueling Mahomes to go even harder next season."
Mahomes greatest QB ever? Not even close. The officials got them there but couldn't drag them across the finish line.
Love how they say hurts cant throw. But throws it 55 yards on the money with ease
Buffalo deserved a spot what a massacre
Mi 8
Can Newton 2.0
I feel like the views wouldve been as high as the halftime performance show ( Shout Out Kendrick ) if the Chiefs wouldve won.
Can we take Mahomo out of the G.O.A.T. conversation now?
How come nobodys calling Travis Kelce out for just standing there on the Pat Mahomes scramble
"Coming from a Texans and Bengals fan who has an annoyingly vocal Chiefs fan as an art teacher, congrats Eagles!"
Chiefs fans real quiet
The eagles went for the jugular vein on the chiefs and found it
Sorry but the chiefs should of not gotten their first 6 points. The shuffle pass to kelce should have been flagged. Pat was a yard or two past the line of scrimmage when he passed the ball
"Brady is a jinx for mahomes in the superbowl this yr, superbowl 55 and afc championship in 2018 season. Also refs missed the facemask on mahomes when he got sacked fumbled."
"The Eagles Vs Chiefs from 2 yrs ago, was a way better game. This SB felt sloppy asf."
What an Awesome 1st half by the Eagles..... WOW 101
"Did anyone have on their preseason bingo card that ""Kenny Picket kneel down in Victory formation"" would be the last play of the NFL season?"
THAT DEFENSE LINE WAS VIOLENT
NFL knew Philly fans would burn down cities if they robbed them of the bowl LOL
"I don't know who needs to read this but, ""Your favorite sports team winning or losing does not reflect your personal success(unless you gambled on them)....Also, you're not on the team, so stop saying we when referring to the team."""
"No motivational speech from mahomes down 0-27 is why they lost . Brady - ""Come on now let's go! Gotta play harder. Gotta play tougher. Harder, tougher, everything. Everything we got!"" down 3-28."
"As an Eagles fan, this one was that much sweeter having to go through the 2022 loss. Go Birds!"
"Laugh now eagles fans , youll cry later"
grande jogo
"Dunno about you guys, but I could watch this 17 times per season."
15:45
"Need a stand seat, with 6 seats around me empty. So I can do my thing, watching the game, in row middle 30 ."
okay im guilty this is like 9th time watching this
Most embarasing loss from the chiefs
6:16
Reality Kansas City Chiefs: No Cheats Mode
"Well, all we need now is Philly to beat the Raiders in a SB to Avenge Jaws"
As a eagles fan my whole life i always like to hope that no one get hurt but I will always be an eagles fly eagles fly Super Bowl champions
Everybody loves the Eagles
"You want your streak to be broken ?.... Come to New Orleans .. Undertaker lost his WrestleMania streak to Brock Lesnar in the Big Easy , The Chiefs lost in the Big Easy .. whose next ?"
There's a hold on Jalen Carter every single play
Hurts so bad!!!!!!!!?
8:30 you ladies alright ahh catch bro
AMERICAS TEAM
"5 sacks, two interceptions A bad day for the Chiefs"
Too much talent on o & d lines
Not a eagles fan but Ive been singing Fly Eagles Fly all week
That was nice of the eagles to let chiefs score 22 points so that they can feel 22
Chiefs forgot to pay the refs
WHERE ARE ALL THE TAYLOR SWIFT MEMES!? COME ON Y'ALL THIS IS THE TIME TO BUST THEM OUT LOVE TO WATCHING KELCE ACT LIKE A CHUMP
The most satisfying Super Bowl the general community has seen. We've seen dominant Super bowls but none this satisfying.
13:09 A Lombardi Trophy
Go Birds
"Ive tried my best but I really dont understand this sport and every time I blink, theres another long commercial."
"Cool,I'm preparing for return."
Chiefs...overconfident or not confident?? the fact is Eagles show them who was the best statistics are just numbers... but brain is the key. CONGRATS EAGLES
Go birds
14:14 he was past the line of scrimmage
Ugly game. from Mahomes and chiefs offense that is. Jalen replicate his performance from last Super Bowl clutch as hell.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Beautiful to watch the defeat of the proud....FLY EAGLES FLY!!! The bestest SB everrrrr
Rewatched this several times and it never gets old..
Imagine paying that much money for that lol
"THE EAGLES SAVED FOOTBALL, thank you Cooper Dejean, thank you Jalen Hurts, thank you Davante Smith, thank you AJ Brown, and most of all thank you the whole Eagles team"
@9:56 ref almost got pieced up
Most boring sport
As a eagles fan i cant stop watching these highlights lol
Is it not rugby? What is the difference
Watched this Game Now 7 Times.! Lord Bless the Eagles.
SO HAPPY FOR MY BIRDS!! They can easily win a few more in the next decade.
Mahomes after this game be like: i really understand it now
2025
How is in 2026
Wow ! How can The Eagles be so dominant at that highest level of American Football ?
I pick Philly to win as that's where Boxer @TimWithersoon is at !
Thank God for the soccer the real football !
Go Birds
Mahomrs ruined everything
E L E S G S EAGLES!!!!
i was told over 40 yrs ago most NFL games won/lost at the LOS & this game was certainly no exception
You could clearly see the Eagles were the better team after each team's first drive.
Lead rusher: Jalen hurts
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Kansas shitty
N
Who else is an Eagles fan watching this video for the 100th time.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"People actually want to watch this again? Eagles fans maybe, but that was one boring game."
Got absolutely dominated
Eagles fans calm down yall ant winning it next year tho we will he back stronger n better
Big win for Klutch Sports
Why are so many people standing on the sidelines?
what makes people want to watch this boring game?
Ive seen these highlights everyday since the superbowl. Man great year to be an eagles fan. Go birds.
Fly Eagles Fly
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"@9:19 sorry dhop, the refs cant save your BITTERfingers"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
The fact I got a Chiefs ad before watching this is even more icing on the cake lol
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
The moment 27-0
. . ! !
LeBraun with the interception!
"2 tempos ""Fly Eagles Fly"": https://youtube.com/shorts/TK6v0GWBPWo?si=2SjmqXzCx9t7mTF3"
I think anyone assessing this game honestly would say that Josh Sweat #19 should've been the MVP.... The guy was an absolute MONSTER. The pick to Baun was because of Sweat.
"score is 22-40 at 1:48 48 for a,erica 48 continental states and 2+2 is 4 and 2+2+4 is 8 48 1:48 like theres one 48 all american that adds to 48 which 224 can be 48"
Philadelphia Eagles like the church of Philadelphia final score 22-40 wow 224 again last year 224 for superbowl and this year score is 22 40 and the eagles win. The eagele has landed twice 2024 2025 washington Eagle and America
So great to watch Chiefs and Ravens lose.
"The more I watch this, the more I become convinced this is the greatest defensive performance ever in a Super Bowl. 6 sacks, pressure on basically every dropback, not a single blitz, 3 turnovers and a defensive touchdown. It doesnt get any better"
I'm still wondering where the Chiefs highlights are
TOUCHDOWN
Thank you so much for this video. It was very interesting.
BTA
"Philly fan here, I knew the Eagles would win, but not like this. The Chiefs finally got what they deserved, refs couldn't save them this time. LOVE HURTS!"
We need an iconic name for this game for the history books.
Turns out a white boy can play cornerback all racists
"Im a ravens fan, and I enjoyed every second of this beat down."
When will the Raiders win?
The d line was sacking mostly every play
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"The Game's MVP should have been given to the Eagles's 4 pass rushers. The chiefs tried defending them with 5, 6, 7 and 8 players. I guess KC could have deployed 10 players to protect its QB."
Our eagles drop the best 2 superbowls ever. Written in the history books baby
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
16:00 my favorite moment in the (not so much a) contest
When was the last time a QB performed that badly in a super bowl? Manning against Seattle? Gannon? Mahomes was terrible.
No doubt about it. As a chief fan we need a new young coach. We need Tommy Tuberfield. He recruited Mahomes to Texas Tech.
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
wish the eagles would have ran up the score instead of relaxing
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
Been hearing crickets lately since the chiefs Lost
"Who would've ever thought they'd hear the commentator say ""and the Chiefs are finally on the board"" in the 3rd quarter"
"Patrick and Andy should have ran ""the ol bundlerooski"""
Travis Kelce cannot block! Watch him on the 6 sacks.
no bad penalty calls to save them
Mahomes got the same medecine that the bucs gave him
Embarrassing for chiefs
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Kelce was too tired from cinna dusting cinnamon toast crunch
What about their referral program? Seems like a good deal if we get a few friends to join up
"Im all for it. Its more fun betting with friends, and those referral bonuses could really add up for us"
What are the chiefs doing
It's insane that they scored 90+ points in the last two games. Super Bowl backups are insane. This group is insane.
Congratulations eagles. So glad chiefs didnt 3peat. That eagles defense is #1 best in nfl and jalen hurts is the 5th best qb in the league
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
GOAT
Thank you for the great content!
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
Teu rame anying teu jelas
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"The NFL now seems un-american.With thier continuance of thier DEI POLICY.BE WOKE,BE A JOKE."
K C overrated
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
13:00 the moment we all knew the chiefs were going to lose
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Amazing content as always!
"In your face mahomes, Eagles you did it you are super bowl Champions."
Imagine being the backup guys getting to play in the last few minutes of the game just to remind everyone that the chiefs are actually good we're just great but fr that probably made their whole career worth it
FLY EAGLES FLY!!! Lets Hunt!! 2PEAT! Time to eat!!
Thank you for the great content!
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"DeJean was snubbed of Super Bowl MVP, you gotta give it to the guy who pick sixes the second greatest quarterback of all time on his birthday"
Thank you for the great content!
The eagles are Dynasty killers.
can't help to think that Bills would've been a much better matchup....
I can watch this over and over. I can't think of a more satisfying sports event ever
We the new dynasty we got the next 2
When the Narrator said Eagles Fly I got emotional
Hurts saved the world
Almost forgot to watch the chiefs lose again
22-40!!
You know that the Chiefs D line were out to get Barkley with a vengeance! But it backfired on them! Congratulations to my Birds! YOU DID IT!
KENDRICK GOT MORE VIEWS THEN THE HIGHLIGHTS I TOLD YOU THIS IS KENDRICK SUPERBOWL
14:12 but play it at .5 speed. Mahomes clearly over line.
Kansas City Chief and Philadelphia eagles have a rematch and the Philadelphia eagles won the super bowl 59
Holding on 74?!? No way
"This was the first NFL season that I got to watch the NFL Sunday ticket starting from week 1, and I must admit that it's the only way that you should watch the NFL. I actually got the NFL Sunday ticket back in 2016 for the final few weeks of the season and it doesn't compare to being able to watch every NFL game on a Sunday from the beginning of the season. Living in NY and being forced to watch the Jets on a weekly basis for years becomes difficult to watch. I found the Giants more tolerable to watch than the Jets throughout the years. Overall, this Super Bowl wasn't a surprising outcome even though I wanted the Chiefs to complete the threepeat."
See what happens when the refs dont save u. !!! lol
14:14 eagles shouldve challenge this. He was over the line. Illegal forward pass.
EAGLE SOUNDS PLAYED FOR 19 MINUTES STRAIGHT !!! WELCOME TO AMERICA BABYYY WTF IS A KILOMETER
That was was an all around outstanding performance from the eagles. No one would have beat that team that night. The D line was beyond lights out and completely shut down the chiefs. And Hurts was throwing darts all night while the O line gave him all the time he ever couldve asked for. What a game to watch
I got 10 ads on this video. Wtf.
Dem eagles tho Big up from the Browns congratulations!!!
The Kansas City Chiefs have fired their referees. While the team officials had performed well enough all season to contribute to a number of victories their inability to come through in the clutch when the team needed them the most led the Chiefs to believe a change had to be made.
Dumb chief
So happy 47 brought them bad luck!!!
What a game and the Halftime show crazy vibe
Why didnt they do the Philly special
In the words of the Kevin Heart Cash Backing $$$
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
dilly dilly
Cheifs winning streak for super bowl is finally over
Chiefs wouldve won game if it went to overtime
"I knew it was coming, all the excuses and accusations about why Kansas City lost the Superbowl to the Eagles! But they had won they all would be lifting their QB to goat status! They disrespect the Eagles defense and offense, like they tried to when Tampa Bay did the same thing to them, beat the brakes off! Now it's the Coaches fault, it's like they can't lose like everyone else, they are special!"
Love seeing Mahomes get sacked
Chiefs defense looked like nagy bears and eagles played like vic fangio bears
Amazing content as always!
Did the backups ever play in a super bowl before this?!
Kansas City Chiefs are history
Never gets old. Watched this more than a few times.
BTA!!!
"Mahomes, you are fired !"
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bAPpl1KUWBQ
At least the pats kept it competitive the chiefs got blown out trying to 3peat
"Thank you, Eagles. For taking down Reid, Mahomes, Kelce, and Taylor Swift. For stopping the Chiefs from being the first team to ever three-peat. For preserving Bradys status as the GOAT. For saving the NFL. Thank you for everything."
Philly certainly soared like eagles
"It just occurred to me that in 5 Super Bowls. 1981, 2005, 2018, 2023, and 2025 the Eagles have never wore their white uniforms."
"MVP Jake Elliot, struggled all year and when the big game comes hes lights out hitting most of his FGs twice after penalties. On a real note, how many people have seen a defense that dominate only rushing 4 guys? Personally I dont remember ever seeing 4 guys take over a game like that."
"Great game, great victory by the Eagles. Enjoyed to the max."
Great! The Superbowl champ is not a commissioner's favorite pet team. It went the other way. God must be with the Eagles this year.
"The Eagles fans believed they could do it. Not sure Tom Brady or the other announcer felt the same, commentary seemed a smidge pro Chiefs. Congratulations to the Eagles."
Tom Brady might have been able to lead the comeback after the half. But Mahomes without ref babbying? No chance.
3 minutes in and already 3 huge mistakes by the refs. They're paying these guys too much. Robo refs when?
The parade was
This was fun!
Most boring Super Bowl ever
I don't like either team. Bad calls -no calls . Mahomes laying down. Cheifs playing like lame ducks. Overrated eagles
1:15 sucking Chiefs dicks
I didn't watch... I refused!!
The eagles are the super bowl champs
"""The eagles are so much better than the EAGLES"" John Fetterman"
I believe the only first down in the first half for the Chiefs was on the first play of the game on offense
I believe I just watched my last State Farm commercial w/ Mahomes and Reid prior to this video.
KC ain't nothing with out the REFS
chiefs o line needs more force
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Proud parents of kids who stand by our Eagles and Palestinians.
Chiefs aint the same when the refs arent saving them
I now have peace!
Laces out
Should have called the bundlelarooski.
Thank you for the great content!
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Why are people just fighting each other in this sport?
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
.. we love you Eagles!! Thank you so much for this much needed beatdown!! Legends!!! Forever remembered and loved!!
"If Chiefs won, the Eagles record would be 666-666..."
"Being that my mom, a Native American, is from Philly and The Chiefs are Native .... This was a win-win situation for me"
"I AM WATCHING AGAIN. I bet 44 million dollars with my wife and I won. The check is drawn on a bank on Mars owned by my in-laws. AS USUAL, she did not cook and I slept hungry."
Do you think the Eagles could have leveraged a better defensive strategy in the second half?
"Brady refers to that KC quarterback by his first name, and the Eagles quarterback by his last. No favoritism there . Very unprofessional!"
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
Elliot came through
Loving the refs in this game as well. Really good highlights. I didn't watch.
Thank you for the great content!

If Messi watches it I'll start watching it even though I don't understand anything because I'm from Brazil
Even in losses Brady always hung close and nearly won. Mahomes has no answer to an adversity.
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Jalen did his thing

Excellent job eagles just love seeing the woke chiefs and Taylor Shits lose
Free Palestine free free Palestine
The game ended 40-6
The two teams that The Philadelphia Eagles lost to in the Super Bowl are the same two teams they beat in the Super Bowl. They beat the Patriots and now the Chiefs with Brady and Mahomes.
The Kansas City Chiefs got absolutely dominated
Nothin was stopping cooper from hittin pay dirt on his bday after that pic
Manchester city vs real madrid highlights at man city youtube channel have more views than this
You have no idea how satisfied I am . I got some Kleenex for Mahomo and Kelce
Kenny Picket happy he got traded now
GO BIRDS
"Man.... I can't decide who my favourite player is, devonta smith, Jalen hurts, saquon or AJ. Im leaning towards AJ BROWN"
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Brady's voice...
i kinda want a niners bills sb next yr tbh
ngl i thought mlb would comment because nfl commented
Not gonna lie this really was shut out imo because those points were literally pity points... The best defense ive ever witness EVER! Hands down... mahomes was shook the whole game! We four man rushed him and didnt even blitz and completely annihilated them the whole game! It was beautiful! Cant wait till im in the city for the parade! GO BIRDS!!
Eagles baby!!!
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
Or maybe just throw the dagger....*chefs kiss*
Its good to see jalen hurts finally getting what he deserves.
"8:37 somewhat reminded me of 23rd pass of Brady to Gronkowski during SB 55 ( Buccaneers vs Chiefs, too) ."
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"The difference between the QBs was their reactions to their mistakes. When Hurts threw a pick he had the you got me, but Imma get you back soon look on his face. When Patrick threw both picks he looked devastated and felt a dreadful night coming his way."
Loved every minute of this game
W aj
cooper dejean
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
The best part is that they asked Kelce to block because they were having trouble on the o-line and he couldn't even do that because he's never been a tight end in his entire career
My favorite Super Bowl
Did anyone notice the how the fans react when the chiefs got their first touchdown???
Eagles made it too big too rig
Why don't they show any chiefs highlights?
"Rigged ,"
Oh I love coming back here
The real score 40-6. Eagles played 2nd and third string after that lol.
A good old fashioned school yard beat down
sad for chiefs go eagles
They lost there streak
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"As a Cowboys fan, I was rooting for the Eagles the entire game"
I'm happy asf the refs didn't win. but why tf philly gotta become BLM? y'all need to chill. the baby oil clearly didn't work

Anyone notice that the Eagles Twice have took out the top Super Bowl Winning Teams? First time they took down the Patriots and now this time they take down the Chiefs. Idk seemed cool to me so I thought Id share it
Who else thought it was going to be the first ever shut out in Super Bowl history?
Football surprese
I love seeing the chiefs lose and seeing Mahomes get humbled. No 3 peat for you Cheater
Can I watch this Super Bowl full game?
Hi my team is ike
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Referees didnt show up. Seriously, Eagles 26 impacted the game far more than his numbers. Eagles dominated. Maybe KC needs more State Farm commercials."
The series where Mahomes was sacked twice in a row followed by a pic six sealed this game.
Madder head coach football
Weird not seeing Kelce not dancing
That touchdown dance was sweet
Why was Patrick mahomes offered Santa Claus's job after the Superbowl? Because he had 5 more sacks on him than santa
love it
i love them
From a NYG fan: Congratulations to the Eagles and especially RB Barkley. He won a SB ring and a top ten rushing title! One of the greatest RBs ever. The NYG should wear this black eye for a long time. Im glad for Barkley! Anybody but Dallas.
The Eagles made it too big to rig
One of the worse super bowls ever nfl you loss a fan that day
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
One of the best Super Bowl games I have seen. I hate that many were saying it got boring. It didn't. The Eagles were very determined not to let the game end like it did the last time they played the Chiefs in the Super Bowl where the Chiefs won by a field goal. Now that was a boring game.
This game was freaking amazing
Patrick Mahomes doing everything he can on the football field like Paul Crewe. Thank you Patrick Mahomes and KC Chiefs for giving us 3 Superbowls (so far).
"What a great throw from Jalen to devontae .Jalen ,you took over and got things done.great performance 14:26"
The chiefs were highly embarrassed by the world champion eagles.eagle nation. 13:29
Colossal beatdown . One of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history
11:58 why is kelce just standing there
Ozark.
"American football, compared to what you americans call ""soccer"", Is a game for simpletons, full of pauses that can be filled by commercials. You americans are customers, dumb, idiotic customers... We europeans are fans. So sad watching your sports."

"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
lets go
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
The Real Mahomes
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"It was a nice game and very entertaining. I almost cried for the looser because the game was some how difficult for them, but i later shared tears of joy for new champion. Perfect game, perfect victory. Good job guys and congratulations champion."
The eagles defense are a bunch of doggs
"So happy eagles are super bowl champions. Now the eagles are not just in the ""super bowl club"", but have multiple super bowl championships. Go eagles. Current super bowl champions and the best team in the NFL."
And he was across the line with the shuttle pass The ref still did try and they didn't show the DeAndre Hopkins catch because I know he didn't catch it
Madden really needs to fix jalens accuracy every throw is orange.
The AFC West division will be one of the toughest divisions to contend with in all of football next season.
The refs tried to help too both field goals in the beginning they tried to call them back and they still got destroyed
Jalen hurts is now the second best qb in the nfl with that win
This game was incredible! So proud of our team! GO BIRDS See you at the parade!!
Lets be real I know theres a lot of haters and naysayers and all that stuff but I will say that the Eagles played like the best NFL team in history not one mistake. It was flawless. You really need to respect that Eagles defense and offense like no team in NFL history could beat them the way they were playing because it was 95% perfect and nobody is 100% perfect
Well mahomes dont quit your day job (commercials)
Well mahomes dont quit your day job (commercials)
No Eagles bias but this might be on of best superbowls in nfl history
tom brady said not much there with that late hit on saquon and coming from him thats funny....he was the most babied qb when it comes to the refs protecting him....
after that AJ brown offenisve PI i thought we were screwed and the refs were going to bury us. cant tell you how happy i was for Jalen hurts!!! i felt like a proud father after watching all the disrespect he gets.....
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
NFC east! The most dominant division in history does it again!
"Congrats to the Eagles on winning the Super Bowl, well Deserved!!"
I don't want to say fixed but fixed?
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
I see they used denvers play book
People trying to be NFL coaches why the chiefs were going to beat the Eagles Andy Reid being there before High school coach beat the Patriots coach last time
So how much did the Bookies pay who to loose this time?
Just retitle this to Eagles Super Bowl 59 highlights
So happy for this outcome...
12:16 lol this might be my favorite Super Bowl. At least tied with the three wins the raiders have.
"as a chiefs fan this game was a hard watch, honestly our worst game to date. can't believe we didn't show up... all love to the eagles tho, they played amazingly <3 just wish the chiefs could've matched that energy"
"Ima be honest if I knew the eagles was gonna beat the breaks off the chiefs, I wouldve watched the super bowl"
Go birds i know Im late sorry
"Lets be honest, Jalen hurts should have passed a lot better and it wouldve reached 60. The defense won that game"
Been waiting my whole life for a game like this one
"I believe Eagles' two bowls are among the coldest of all time. Both faced the decade's top team, the Patriots and Chiefs."
D Sstidd equals
"So let me get this straight... Against the Rams' number one defense, Joe Burrow plays hard and keeps the game very close until the final drive. Against the Buccaneers' and Eagles' number one defenses, Mahomes has among the worst ratings in Super Bowl history and is repeatedly blown out, looking trampled and annihilated. Tom Brady when down 28-3 motivates his teammates on the sideline and ends up winning 34-28. I think I'd rather take Burrow and Brady."
Kelce with the play of the game at 11:55
Now the Kansas City chiefs are going to have to win next year.
Reminds me of Super Bowl LV Where the Bucs held the Chief to zero touchdowns.
The announcers were trying so hard to convince the game wasnt over
Patrick was see ghost like Sam Darnold on jets
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Wooooooo men throw ball to location for points woooo America
9:31 12:52
Kinda reminds me of when me and my cousin 1v1 in madden
Mahomes running for his life
Pat had a tough day in the office.
@13:00 one of the best calls this season
This was rigged
Great Defense by thr Eagles
l love eagles and chiefs
Amazing content as always!
GO BIRDS
Enjoy every minute..beat the chiefs down..
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Birdgang
Did Kansas throw the game?
The eagles put btaaaaa
"Mahomes running for his life, for the 2nd time around in Superbowls ( Tampa Bay, Eagles ). It's just only shows that Tom Brady is the undisputed NFL goat."
Jalen Hurts.. a man of dignity. honor and humble.. Sidleined even when he carried the team in Alabama but never complained.. Took it all in his stride and proved that he can be better with time and patience.. Never a bad word out of him.. Just continue to impress.. He deserves it all... Great job Jalen... you deserve it... RESPECT
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
That last sack was personal smacked mahomes back to reality
"""Defense win championship"", they should have Mercy Rule in place while the score was 34-0 at 3rd Quarter, coz it's a blowout basically"
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
What is going on?
Mahomes will never be blitz for the rest of his career
"""You think FOX gonna let you disrespect Brady "" lol"
sister saw deep into the future.
"To the EXACT numbers too,"
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Thank you for the great content!
40-6 was the trie score!!!
9:19 Hopkins wondering why the refs didn't call that a catch
"Poor Kermit, all those sacks, its got to be tiring, but Im blaming Trumps kiss of death support for the chiefs."
Mahomes getting folded like origami and fumbling was one of the great moments for me
basically a 40-6 game
Cooper Dejean is going to be in KCs nightmares for a long time
Josh Sweat and that entire defense was choking them out . KC looked like they wanted none of them.
""" Mustard on the beat hoe, Ninjas calling Mahomes the GOAT but he couldn't 3 peat tho! Man down call the ambulance because the Chiefs choked, that Philly D not playing KC came in and got steamrolled!"
""" I said Mahomo , I said Mahomo Can't step this way step this way"
This was embarrassing
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Travis went on the podcast & complained about the calls imagine that
Maybe the Chief's loss was part of DOGE.
"Whats crazy is, the final score isnt going to show just how much the Eagles dominated this game."
Heheh
Day 4 of watching this. Itll never get old
FLY BABY FLY!!!!!..EEEEEGOOOOS
Well done the Eagles. Raiders fan
what is that ? most stupid sport all around the world ?
"America needed this win. Great game, great halftime show."
Worst quarter back i have ever seen in super bowl...
"HOW YOU NFL allowed the BUMP to happen but not the so called ""Pass Interference"" at the 1st call, ur loosing ya grip!~"
11:54 - What the hell was up with Kelce just standing there!? I didn't even notice it because I focused on the Hold on BG.
Yeahhh
Thought I was on Pornhub for a second
"this was the Red Wedding for the Chiefs, they thought the refs would carry them but they started calling their bs"
"This is twice now that the Eagles have become America's darlings by taking down the NFL's appointed golden children in the Super Bowl. First they did it to Tom Brady, now they did it to Patrick Mahomes. For as much as we as sports fans like to make fun of Philadelphia and their teams, they can really be the hero when they want to be."
Fist time in NFL history every single eagles draft pick in 2024 has out did the class of 2024HOWIE IS A BEAST.
I still cant believe we won. I love this team. Philly you are the greatest ever. Two rings. This is incredible
American football is so boring. I fancy Rugby and World football more
Its not the chiefs were bad .. Just eagles were Way better..
FLY s FLY
20 most TERRIFYING moments in NFL on my YouTube channel..
Tom Brady should not be calling these games...choppy and I don't even know...#privilege
Worst call was the offsides they called false start on the eagles 1st fg.
The halftime getting more views than the game itself is crazy
Voodoo on Mahomes in New Orleans crazy
CAME BACK FOR REVENGE GO BIRDS
Fly Fly
Watching this back the Eagles really did homework on Chiefs o line they got walked
bye Taylor Swift .. hahaahahahah dont come back NO MORE NO MORE
"I hate how some people said the game was boring, but this is what most nfl fans wanted to see. Cheifs getting whopped"
14:13 Mchomes was Passed the Line of Scrimmage..... that should have been IN COMPLETE.....
"Im a Detroit Lions fan and I was rooting so badly for Philly on Sunday night because Im sick of KC, Mahomess goat talk vs Brady, The NFL showing TS every five seconds, and Swifties thinking the NFL wasnt popular before TS. Congrats to Philly. Hopefully my Lions can get there next year."
13:40 maybe the dagger... it WAS the Dagger
I can tell the announcers WANTED Mcholmes to win
Jalen Hurts and Mcholmes Switched Identities lol
"its almost 20,000 comments.. im sure its come CHiefs fans on here... MAD"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
I said it 2 weeks ago if the refs don't intervene the eagles will wipe the floor with the chiefs people laughed at me
2:50 he's so sure of it
Such an ugly sport rugby is beautiful compare with this utter bulsshit sport Americans are weird man
Mahomes was SHOOK
MY GOODNESS THE EAGLES FRONT 4 MADE MAHOMES LOOK LIKE A REGULAR GUY OUT THEIR.CHIEFS HAD NO CHANCE FROM THE FIRST SNAP OF THE BALL.
God this was satisfying.
Is there gone be a micd up highlight like they be doing?
That shuffle pass mahomes was past the line
Anybody mentioned the kicker yet?
This never gets old
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
who dat said they going to beat them EAGLES <3 Hey cowboys where's your rings?!
Eagles dominated the Chiefs so much not even the refs could help them!
BTA
"Among all the other emotions of winning or losing, take a second to appreciate that NFL didn't edit out Brady's comments on the officiating on those early calls. The near universal dissatisfaction with ref calls needs to stay heard!! GO BIRDS BABY!!"
I think Ive rewatched this highlights 20x Proud of my eagles
"Okay, I don't know Brady was considered so terrible as an analyst in this game."
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Ive been to 11 super bowls 1. Super bowl XXVII (27) 2.super bowl XXIX (29) 3 super bowl XXXIV (34) 4. Super bowl XXXVII (37) 5 super bowl XXXVIII (38) 6. Super bowl XXXIX (39) 7.super bowl XLVI (46) 8. Super bowl XLIX (49) 9. Super bowl LI (51) 10. Super bowl LV (55) 11 super bowl LIX (59)
As an Eagles fan this was the most satisfying Super Bowl I've ever seen. An absolutely HUMBLING revenge on the Chiefs.
So this is what happens when the refs don't help the Chiefs.
The game was over at halftime. I'm glad the second half happened so everyone could see the Chiefs crying and exactly what Mahomes is a stat chaser.
"Chiefs got absolutely destroyed, wow!"
Poor Patrick mahomes... No zebras protecting him that night. Eagles make sure not to hit him too hard because they would have got caught for unnecessary roughness. Could not have happened to a most deserving team
The Eagles were very merciful they could have shut KC down to zero points but no the Eagles showed their sportsmanship and allowed KC to score some points as not to humiliate KC at all.
This eagles team didnt lose a single game when healthy They lost 3 games 2 were when aj brown was hurt and the other when hurts got concussed early vs washington they were up big before he got concussed too..think about that they were pretty much undefeated at full strength
KC struggled all year to win games.Off line needs major help
Does anyone remember that Saints game where they scored 62 pts? THIS is similar to that one
The Eagles put their back-ups in during the 4th quarter because they knew they already won lmfao. That's a new level of disrespect
Im not a football fan But god damm chiefs got smoked
They put froggy through it on this night by froggy
It goes to show u that the chiefs arent is great of a team without the help of the refs
"God, has the chief's in the palm of his hands... He will show up and show out!!! Hallelujah"
"By the time it was 40-6, Chiefs fans were leaving for the bed"
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
The scoreboard looks like a 3 year old who plays with blocks
"I can only wonder how a Eagles-Bills Super Bowl wouldve been, shouldve been those teams in the first place if th refs didnt favor KC so much"
Elliot guy's pretty good.
11:55 watch Kelce.. hes not Gronk.
Crazy how everybody jus hates the Chiefs and want to blame the refs for every little single thing. Like get a grip. Chiefs jus played horrible. Refs had absolutely nothing to do with this. Even they lost the Chiefs are bound to be back in the SB for years to come with having a great QB like Mahomes. They win and losers hate winners. CHIEFS KINGDOM.
8:37 32 guy didn't even try.
Id be willing to bet the birds front 4 on d had a personal contest going on between them for who got most touches on Mahomes lol
Thats why the chiefs are terrible Im glad the eagles humbled them and they finally got there revenge from losing 2023 Super Bowl 38-35 to them
They were too predictable. The Eagles knew they ran out of ideas.
Imdont even like football but in this game the eagles destroyed the chief
Watching American football for the first time . Trying to figure out how the rules work.
"i loved watching this gane, it was the best night of the weekend for me"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
welp. We'll see how things go next season... please hurry
"Have to give the Eagles kicker some credit here for this win, he was kicking darts dead center and didn't get flustered when he had to re-kick a couple times. Chiefs got humbled!!!"
"I'm not an EAGLES FAN or CHIEFS FAN...I don't even watch football...BUT I was soooo annoyed with seeing CHIEFS bragging about winning for the last 2 years...I just want them to lose and be humbled...I even BET against them and won $100,000."
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Eagles were the most successful in the Super Bowl, take that, Kansas City Chiefs!"
40-6 is crazy. Dont want to hear that mahomo guy compared to Brady
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"7:20-7:23 ""They haven't been able to do much against this Chief's defense"" Bruh it's 17-0 What do you mean by nothing XD"
This game was so boring
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Eagles used violence to win
The only reason the chiefs even got any points is the eagles took out their starting defense.
E-L-G-S-E-S.EAGLES!!!
I live in Seattle. I like the Seahawks but they have semi good. But Eagles Ive had a soft spot for a long time. They have been doing really well the last few years. So Im happy they won. But this was redemption. I havent seen my co worker yet since the Super Bowl. So Im going to rub it in a little in his face. Cause he did when they lost last time to the chiefs. His special needs so its nice banter.
Thank you New York Giants for Saquan
First PICK-6 by a white cornerback is Super Bowl history.
Wow chiefs played horribly
To easy for the eagles
This Cowboys fan loved every minute of seeing the team of the swifties go bust in the best kind of way
49ers fan here. Thank you Philadelphia Eagles
Watching while listening to my favorite Kendrick instrumentals in the background....feels so good!! E A G L E S
Broncos country thanks you Eagles
Shut up about KCs three peat EAGLES WIN SB CHAMPIONS!
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Aint no refs to save the cheaters!
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Eagles gave it totally to the cheeks and over rated home hahaha.
with defense like that im surprised the eagles lost a few games in the regular season
Thank you for the great content!
"So many Americans are so happy that the Eagles beat the Chiefs, maybe the Eagles should now be 'Americas Team'."
YES EAGLES !!!
Its days later and im still watching it
3:52 massive hold on SB uncalled lol
Best Super Bowl of all time. 2024 Eagles solidified as one of the all time great teams!
Did AJ do the LeBron celebration
For the record that was not 1the throw of his life Jalen hurts has been completing passes like this his whole college and nfl career so stop it ok and you can claim everybody in the world thought philly would run but the only person that said that was you jalen did what he does best pass that ball nobody thought philly would run the ball they did what we all knew they would go eagles
The real score should be 34 0 lol patty mahomes with a 1 qbr going until first half lmao 23 passing we had 24 points....
"That first penalty looks like the fix was in for the Chiefs, but as it was in the presidential election the Eagles had too big of a lead to steal"
Listen to this jealous commentary jalen throws a perfect back sholder pass but he says great play by the reciever lol
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Thank you for the great content!
"People keep saying mahomes is out of the goat conversation because of this game,but on my life if him and jalen switched roles,the blowout would have been more embarrassing.."
This was looking like a throwed game after a while ..
Redeno mgica
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Defense wins games! GO BIRDS!
I didn't know they were allowed to broadcast live executions anymore.
I`m not US man. I wanted E`s victory. It became true. so happy.
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"

what is that little thing the referee throws in 4:27?
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Mahomes to home
My favorite 15:43
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
SO satisfying to watch these highlights AGAIN!!!
We don't have this exciting game in Britain. Do you have a women's Super Bowl please?
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
People don't understand HE AINT NORMAL. This is 6-40 on the chiefs the best team in the league with bought refs / mob ties and they got destroyed! Hopefully y'all woke up.
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
That game was the most Philly thing ever. Go birds!
Not an Eagles or Chiefs fan but I definitely rooted for the Eagles. Congrats to the team. Not crazy about their fans. Props to Mahomes for not giving up after all those sacks.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
We need a mic Ed up version
"This game in some way's reminded me of the Legion of Boom's dominance in SB 48.. As an Eagles fan, remembering that SB when I was a kid thinking ""this is pure dominance and this is what it looks like for the world to see"" only to happen to us was incredible. Truly a tough nosed no BS defense.. show someone this when they don't believe SB's win championships."
Eagles are superbowl champs fly eagles fly
@15:42 is the most satisfying NFL clip Ive ever seen. Enjoyed that very much!
"I'm not an Eagles fan, and I am incredibly disappointed. That said, it's nice to have a team get a lead early and actually *hold* it."
Thank you for the great content!
best sb witnessed. legend born (barkley)
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
TICK TOCK
Who going to the parade? See you there
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
god tom brady is a terrible caller please relegate him to midday games until further notice
6:12
"The Eagles did America a favor and showed what happens when the game is officiated fairly, plus saved us from witnessing a ridiculous proposal from Travis Kelsey to Taylor Swift, and halted a Chiefs 3-peat out of existence!!"
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Mental. Not sure I've seen the Reid-era Chiefs get dominated like this, let alone in a Superbowl. That scoreline massively flatters the Chiefs, as well. A fired-up Eagles Defence don't allow at least two of those scores."
I watched the game I never seen Patrick Mahomes sacked 6 time or play so poorly before. I was like the WTF. I'm not an Eagles or Chiefs fan
I just got 6 ads and 4 seconds of video
"As a diehard football guy... on the cooper Dejean pick 6, why was there NOT a holding penalty on chiefs RT tackle(#74)? he tackled the guy... Just another play that the chiefs getting away with holding. Amazing that KC only 1 offensive holding penalty all game... KC #74 was holding all day.."
Can't stop watching. Go Birds!!!
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
I love how patrick mahone helped the eagles win the super bowl
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
13:31 smith literally jogging man its not fair
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
mahomes need the mvp he was throwing them touchdowns
This was brutally beautiful
Yall need to take it easy on the ads.
"I want to give CREDIT to the KICKER"" number""( 4) FOR PUTTING THOSE EXTRA POINTS ... ON THE (BOARD) WHEN WE:::: NEEDED IT... GO EAGLES"
"As much as I don't like Mahomes, this game wasn't his fault at all, he played fine, his o-line failed him completely, I don't think this should really count as a stain on his legacy."
#WEAREPHILLY #SPECIAL
the real score of this match was 6 - 37
Game was rigged and scripted af! Im not a fan of neither teams playing but its so obvious kc was not even trying idk how ppl watching the nfl anymore thinks its legit
Im going to look back at this and say eagles you saved the super bowl
RaiderNation.
I will watch this everyday till the season starts
Truly amazing seeing spags look like a rookie DC out there
"It's like the Eagles were studying the Raiders against the Chiefs this season. Yes, the Raiders lost both games but the Raiders did harasse Mahomes the most this past season. The Eagles just took it to another level and on the most important game of them all. Good game!"
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"Super bore, so lopsided I quit watching halfway through the 4th quarter. The Cleveland CLOWNS, uh, Browns could have made a better showing than the Chef's, uh, Chiefs!!!"
The ref was nodding his head like lets go eagles when he thought they scored the touchdown
Can someone explain in European football terms why everyone wanted the chiefs to lose? Thanks.
"Was anyone outside of the 12 people that live in KS and MO actually rooting for KC? They are definitely good, but also the douchiest team in history. At least the LOB in Seattle had personalities."
Mahomes Who?
"This should just be called ""Philadelphia Eagles Superbowl Highlights"" at this point"
It's only Wednesday and I've looked at this about 5 times. It feels great to be an eagles fan.
Yup fly eagles fly
E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES
Yeah I'm still not understand the rule at all
14:10 forward pass lol
"Everyone celebrates black qbs, black coaches, black refs. Wheres the espn headline saying first white cornerback to return a pick in the Super Bowl in decades"
Eagles dominated this game
"Let em know Tom! We dont like the ticky tack fouls in the super bowls. Keep folks healthy during the regular season, let em fly in the Super Bowl"
A total smackdpwn
Very satisfying game. Humbled a lot of folks
How on earth did KC win back-to-back Super Bowls?
i can not believe the Eagles gave 22 points away to those fukkin Chiefs
Which Clock was the one everyone seems to be talking about?
Yay Taylor Swift lost the super bowl
Chief's lost because they don't have a RB to confuse the defenders

This might be the best defensive game in a Superbowl. Matched next to seattle in the Superbowl with Peyton Manning when he was with the Broncos.
Fly Gagles Fly
"This is what happens when you sell out to stop Saquon Barkley Also, this defense was absolutely INSANE"
"From our first game I knew this team and the great group of men both on the field and off, were magic! Thank you Eagles for showing everyone that we got what it takes! World Champions! Let it soak in! Enjoy it you all, deserve it. See you on Broad Street Friday Baby! Go Birds! Always! The hunt is over this year."
How is this considered a sport?!
Game summary: Chiefs offensive line takes a dump and mahomes gets sacked every other play...
"Gambling odd were heavely imbalanced, everyone was betting on chiefs. They had to let eagles win"
"Like the election, it was too big to rig."
#11 @ 9:06 said excuse me moved over very politely
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
incredible game to watch if you are a chiefs hater whoa whoa wooo whoa
Man that was a beat up and I love it
"Man i really wanted cooper to get a couple more pics. Imagine, rookie, first superbowl, playing Superbowl on birthday, and becoming superbowl mvp that woulda been lit"
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
Satisfying game
Took a lot of smack talk from 49er and Redskins fans. This game brought a lifetime of Eagle craziness full circle
B2A
GO BIRDSSSS
Patrick mahomes is now exposed to 4 Man Rush defense same tactics that Buccaneers used against him with Tom brady Tom brady also destroyed and he was the first one to show how easy it is to defeat Chief's and chasing Mahomes lol the Chief's try to same type of pressure to Brady and Eagle's but failed he is not greates brother Tom brady is Patric mahomes is good player but not worthy of Greatness of 1)
Worst Superbowl ever
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
The offensive pass interference at the start of the game made me lose my mind I thought we were about to see another rigged game

Tom Brady may be the GOAT on the field but he sounding like Sergio Dipp in the booth.
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
In the highlight reel of the Superbowl why not start with the kickoff?
"The thing that get me is KC CELEBRATING while down hella points , dude yall celebrating more times than yall made a play"
"Not huge fan of American football I'm more into real football (what in USA is called soccer), MMA stuff like that but even i got tired of this Kansas team happy for Eagles fan. enjoy your moment."
"As someone who roots for the Giants (hometown team) and the Bills (actually IN NY, plus actually competitive), this game scratched a lot of itches."
I would like the full game of this just like super bowl 57 58
"I loved every second of this, except maybe the first few drives"
It's so beautiful
Thank you for the great content!
"Never really followed NFL until Jordan Mailata made me look, cheeeeehoo!"
This game proved that the chiefs got to the Super Bowl with ref help and lucky wins.
Nothing you can do against 4 man rush like that
""" 6 sacks, 2INTS Mahomes ain't you tired? 0-3 when the GOAT in the build now that's a one linerrrrrrrrrr!!"

"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Eagles have won 2 super bowls where they scored 40 or more points! Both Super Bowl wins were paybacks for previous Super Bowl losses against the same opponents.
Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles. How Bout Them Cowboys
"1:00 I know all my Eagles fans were like, ""Here we go!!!"""
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"Well, I still dont get this sport"
Brilliant this . Not a fan of either but I'm glad the Eagles won.
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.

I don't like the eagles or the chiefs but u can tell the chiefs threw this bowl game have u everrrrr seen the chiefs struggle this bad ??
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
14:14 this was blatantly a lateral that was not called. Chiefs scored their first points on this drive so you really could say every single point the Chiefs scored in this came with an asterisk
Chiefs needed that bundlerooski
14:25 9 has holding as hell on 55 but refs let the Chiefs score
I seriously couldnt tell whether that was patrick mahomes or dak prescott oops I mean STAT PADSCOTT in the 4th quarter absolutely pathetic
Kelce at 5:51 play wow
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
How fitting of Brady to be the analyst commentator for this
"As a Niners fan, this was emotionally cathartic to watch and honestly it doesnt matter which team was the one to finally do it, the point was simply to make the chiefs look foolish and to inflict as much frustration and pain as possible on them in the most important game of the season, and that was what happened. So, from the niner faithful (and Im sure many other fan bases like Buffalo, Cincy, etc.), this was what we all wanted and needed to see and as strange as it feels to say, I appreciate the eagles for making this game as enjoyable as possible for all the fans of the teams that have seen heartbreak because of the chiefs to finally see them get brutally and thoroughly embarrassed on the biggest stage. Cant wait for next season and I hope it comes as quickly as possible so we can all get back to watching our squads play together again."
This is my second rewatching of the highlights after watching the whole game. It doesnt get old.
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"@19:33... 1:19 3rd quarter, game time Mahomes crosses the line of scrimmage and makes an illegal forward lateral."
"Who,my wife and I,,we loved the game,,how does it feel,,to lose the big one,not a hater,,just not a fan of K C,,"

"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
@13:02 When I knew the game was over and a comeback wasnt happening. Mahomes run started because Garropolo couldn't hit his wide-open man on a deep pass with nothing but the end zone in front of him.

It was such a beating even the refs werent going to save the chiefs
"Great job, this video was very useful!"

Amazing content as always!
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
The only reason i watched this is bc the eagles won
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
To be honest even Chiefs fans wanted the Eagles to win
DeAndre DROPkins
"The reason we watch football is because it's a little violent, please refs injuries are part of the game, please don't ruin football."
KC...... take a seat
What a game of handegg
When the Chiefs were winning they always put the camera on Taylor Swift..
Grandi Eagles titolo strameritato
good game
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
Realized at 14:13 Mahomes steps over the line of scrimmage before he passes it with no call
This Eagles defense is now legendary for how they took KC to the woodshed Jalen Carter smacked the soul outta Mahomes Coop with the pick 6 on his bday Milt n Sweaty with 2 sacks apiece Zack Baun w a pick Meanwhile Jalen Hurts outplayed Mahomes again in the biggest game SuperBowl MVP!!!! Unbelievable So proud of my Eagles and everyone in the organization The parade on Broad St is gonna b wild!!!
Mahomes was basically throwing from a burning building all day..go birds
The kansas city cheats rested their starters against denver. Looks to me like the starters. Needed the practice that game
"KC was so bad in this SB that I had to go back 2 weeks ago and watched the AFC championship again. Well,, Mahomes's quick passes, protection, scrambles and receivers opens were all there. WTF happened 14 days later?"
Defense wins championships
Good game.
Vegas had more to do with it than a voodoo doll
I just wish Romo was commentating. Dude be glazing Mahomes 24/7. Want to see the excuses he was gonna make for Pat....
Eagles came to play Chiefs just came
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
this was embarrassing
"Remember that ball that Davonta dropped, against the Commanders, that would have sealed that win, well this catch here was him making up for that one, huge, and yes a dagger, and I knew he was coming up huge in this game."
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
It's ironic that I got a state farm ad before watching the most overrated team lose to the chickens.
most entertaining blow out of all time
14:13 Illegal forward pass.
I cant believe the Chiefs were favored.
When Will The Super Bowl Stop Existing
Only reason Chiefs scored at all was because Eagles gave their B squad a chance to play. Could've shut them out completely.
I just dont know how rugby is not bigger its far better and doesnt stop and better hit. This has so many stops.
"They knew they couldnt rig this one early, eagles were way too good and the chiefs shouldnt of even been there."
Still a chiefs fan. I'ma stick beside them period

I bet 200 USD as a Canadian against the CHIEFS and I am so happy they WON BIG - am not collecting on friends and familybecaudse I am so HAPPY ......................and I love Taylor Swift .....................so please don't hate on her...........
Looking back on this game a few days later.... what were the Eagles front 4 ON! Those boys manhandled that Chiefs O-line. Wild
It happened to us 2 years ago. This revenge is so sweet. Should have 2 in last 3 years. Sacking pus pat 6 times made it not hurt as bad.
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
I mean they did a great job stopping saquon. But to quote k dot... IT'S NOT ENOUGH
Everyone knows it's 40-6 empty calories don't count
I was strictly rooting against the chiefs not necessarily for the eagles but definitely against Taylor swift and the chiefs
I am Chief fan not a Hatrick super bowl congrats chiefs
The D-Hopkins drop was a killer. He was wide open and would've scored a TD giving Patrick some confidence before half. Terrible drop.
"""Sacked again"" never sounded so nice."
Pretty lame that Mahomes was still in the game at the end. Just to pad his stats. B
"Raiders fan here, my heart so glad seeing the faces on chefs players"
Pretty obvious the refs were admonished by the league not to make any calls that were questionable for the Chiefs.
Game of blacks
What type of game is this .... YouTube why you recommend me this game
"This is what Americans call football, these idiots don't even touch the ball with their feet. Real football is outside America, everyone knows this except Americans"
More ads than the actual game
"The most surprising part to me was that KC looked like they gave up while it was still 10-0. Eagles physically bullied everyone, and not even KC could handle it."
I always wonder if they have to train their arms n elbows not to get burned/skinned by the turf I played lax and soccer and diving on the turf like that would tear up your arms so bad
"Darn!! I should have put 10 bands on the Eagles. I would have been on my way to the Ferrari dealership. Too bad. Heh, heh."
"This game was simply great. I get the KC hate, but not the all that super hate lol. But whatever , go eagles"
I know for a fact that eagles aren't repeating because Jalen hurts is always hurt he's injury prone and it's going to show next year watch
13:00 will live in my soul for the rest of my life. Congrats sb mvp.
Fly Eagles Fly! Go Birds!
The Philadelphia Eagles Won
7:01 why bro tackled his teammate
Theyre going to run some clock OR MAYBE JUST THROW THE DAGGER!! HURTS!! GOING DEEP!! FOR IT ALL!! DAVONTE SMITH
14:13 Patrick Mahomes Illegal forward pass on 3rd down
Eagles absolutely embarrassed them . Our defense was to good for them and Patrick looked like a lost puppy out there compared to Jalen . GO BIRDS
Winners never quit. Quiters never win. Props to every player on the field.
15:45 DECKED
40-22
"Brutal game,KC got destroyed."
"So great on so many levels, none the least of which is not having to gag over Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce anymore. ICK....."
I'm an eagles fan too and that was epic
6:26 33 sus af... just saying it looks staged and that number does not help the case
The eagles are punching though kc defence wtf

GO BIRDS!!!
13:00 Dagger!
As a Seahawks fan ty Philadelphia
The eagles flyed
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
kelce just standing still for 5 seconds during a live play is icing on the cake 11:59
"What about it, Spags?"
The chiefs never ran the ball
Chiefs had no business in this game and everyone knew it.
Yea Philly is the best team in the nfl and if it weren't for the nfl cheating in the last superbowl eagles vs kc allowing the eagles defensive coordinator to listen in on the eagles offensive play calling as well as the defensive play calling they would've won the last eagles vs kc superbowl but they hung bill bellichick out there in front of the people/fans years ago claiming they somehow caught bill bellichick listening in on the opposing teams play calling but never told us how they caught him I'm nor sure which team and now that I think about it I don't even think they even said which team in hopes we the fans would think oh they will never do that again and they only reason hurts and the eagles won today should be obvious

"Given how the Chiefs have won games all season, it was incredibly satisfying to see them get absolutely demolished"
"This will forever be one of my favorite Superbowls, not because I am an Eagles fan but because the Chiefs got absolutely destroyed."
The Philadelphia EAGLES will be the blueprint for other teams to win
Eagles were the best team in the nfl this year! No question!
"16:15 Brady should've said ""This happened to me too"""
I sleep better at night knowing the Chiefs lost the three-peat. :)
Moral of the story: Without the refs the chiefs are definitely beatable
"So thankful that game was over. So many say they werent gonna watch and ended up one of the most watched. No Chiefs fan, but still cant take away what theyve already achieved. Cant win them all. Congratulations Hurts, well played game and win"
"If the chiefs win, the MVP goes to Worthy 100%"

"As a Black Fan, I don't care for black Refs. It is getting out of hand of black people being involved in American sports."
One of the most entertaining/satisfying blowouts I've ever witnessed
"Congrats Eagles. Best Super Bowl ever! Sent those Chiefs home in their biggest defeat! You outplayed, and outshined them! Thanks Philly!"
The Eagles didn't only win they embarrassed them by total domination
The comentarists are of KC...
At 7:01 does Milton Williams get credited for 2 sacks?
FLY EAGLES FLY! SUPER BOWL CHAMPS GO BIRDS!

Super bowl more like the Blowout Bowl 40- 22
6:50 # 65
WHAT A EAGLES FANTASTIC DEFENSE !!!! AWESOME!...
By far the most boring super bowl of all time.
Never saw that score coming Glad im not a betting man
It is now reached to Philadelphia Eagles era. After Super Bowl 59 if the Philadelphia Eagles are able to keep this roster I can see the Eagles winning at least another six more Super Bowls by the time Jalen Hurts ends his NFL career and also at this point I can see the Eagles going three straight Super Bowls and winning it than the Chiefs at this point. They really have potential to do that in Jalen Hurts and these Philadelphia Eagles roster era.
Tom Brady is just now going through PUBERTY with his voice
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Hurts has the prettiest long ball.
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
That fumble 3 years ago by j.hurts cost the Superbowl.tittle
Eagles did everything to keep this game out of the refs hands lmfap
That get back a mf go birds
"Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles and the new Super Bowl champions! So glad they denied the Kansas City Chiefs from getting a three-peat, it was definitely never going to happen!"
10:05 3rd and 17 clear as day holding in front of two refs led to a huge run for mahomes
Must be realy satisfied...mahomes whorst appearance ever
"Finally, I loved seeing someone get some good hits on Mahomes and not flagged for it like 15:40"
"Honestly the refs real sus in the first half, no face mask on that one play and that one ref thought it was a touchdown when his knee touched the ground"
"Just when you think the SEC has fallen, they win a Super Bowl lmao"
Scripted. Boycott the NFL.
I know you beach neegas got away with it in the regular season but its over
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
1:37 pat mahomes faked my ahh
6:55 Chiefs #66 trying out for the Eagles

Chiefs can barely even score
Eagles had backups in in the end
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"0:34 when this play happened, there was a chiefs fans being cocky at the place I was watching the game at. The rest of the game, he was silent"
I cant stop watching this masterpiece!!!
16:02 The most satisfying sack on Mahomes for non Chief fans.
It should have been 60-6 score..
This game was a literally Super Bowl 48 all over again As an eagles fan I couldnt be more happier
A new dynasty has begun.
This is my 3rd time watching the highlights I cant get enough of the mahomes sad face
LIONS SUPERBOWL CHAMPS COMING HOME NEXT YEAR
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"As a Miami Dolphins fan, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the Philadelphia Eagles for their impressive victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. Your dominant defensive performance, led by Coach Vic Fangio, was truly inspiring. Your success serves as a blueprint for teams like ours, emphasizing the importance of building strong trenches. Congratulations, Eagles!"
Just word to you nfl Fans you gonna have to watch Cooper Dejean lock down your wrs in Eagles Green 4 life.
I thought I was hallucinating all game. I thought I had dyslexia of the eyes. Man once in a lifetime superbowl. Its one thing when your team gets to the Superbowl.. but its another when they blowout the two time defending champions. E A G L E S EAGLLLLLES!!!
Hell yeah eagles baby. The score was really 40 to 6. Lol they benched our starters that's crazy
That how the avengers endgame does
Some of my game observations. Jalen definitely Hurt after that Game most of these Highlights are him Running or throwing bro. I think it Hilarious that the great Mahomo was able to pull off such an amazing pass to DeJean Definitely the Eagles best Player. Although the Eagles crushed it I will say that one or two of those plays were the Refs. The Chiefs poor O-Linemen just wanted a hug but chose the worst time possible. I love how hard Mahomes got absolutely Decked!. Kelce Needs to stop thinking about swift during Games it definitely shows. Elliot coming out of Nowhere making complete Kicks. Kelce not being able to block for sh*t bro weighs how much more than smith?. Barkley Trolling Physics as per usual. Anyway just some of my observations Congrtats to the Eagles though on a great Win
Thank you Eagles!
the eagles defense only sent 4 and got sacks soooo many times when the chiefs are blocking 5-6. absolutely insane d-line that won the eagles the game fasho
Fly Eagles Fly men v boys go cry back in Kansas Boys ! Chiefs my heiney ! D Team again as a whole massive A great result Superbowl champions
"Now the eagles have to deal with the cap. They can't bring back all their free agents. Most likely 2 of the fabulous front four will be gone. Probably going to have to renegotiate Hurts contract eventually. Reaching the top is one thing, staying there is another. Just ask the chiefs"
Chiefs sold out to stop Saquon forgetting Jalen is a slinger when he needs to be and is a boss
It's amazing to see the birds win it
Eagles DEMOLISHED them poor chiefs
Words cant describe how much I hate the Eagles!!! Not a Chiefs fan either but really hate the eagles. Worst Super Bowl I had ever seen. I didnt even watch it so who am I kidding.
"The Eagles beat the chiefs, if YOU know what I mean!!!"
The Philadelphia Eagles is the NFC Super Bowl Champions
Eagles made the deficit too big to rig. Dominated the chiefs
"WOOO! Eagles, thank you!!! Fins up! Let's go Miami!"
"WOOO! Eagles, thank you!!! Fins up! Let's go Miami!"

Go Dujean what was that about a three peat sorry again whut ? Wee Taylor crying cos the Chiefs got beat ! Lol

"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Wow Eagles won 33-22
"As a Miami Dolphins fan, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the Philadelphia Eagles for their outstanding performance in Super Bowl LIX, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22. Your victory not only showcased your teams excellence but also brought joy to fans across the league. Keep up the fantastic work, and congratulations on your well-deserved championship!"
Great new eagles
15:46 was the most satisfying hit ive ever since on mahommes. More of that next season please.
Felt for pat on that last sack. Ouch
And you still got jumped up yours Chiefs
What ever Chiefs did you pay the linesman cos that was sh.te officiating thought they were supposed to be neutral fit him in your back pockets eh ! Shocking officiating
Amazing content as always!
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"Since i was broke, i had to watch it on here."
"That strip sack with the Jalen Carter push was one of the most violent Super Bowl plays I can remember. It looked like Mahomes got knocked out; he dropped like a rag doll. Carter is a monster player; glad the Eagles got him. Him and that defense with Sweat, Smith, DBs, it was a massacre."
Getting a fumblrooskie commercial before watching
We are champions and its our time to rule the league for at lest five more years and counting We Are EAGLES
Imagine being a Chiefs and a Drake fan
Blown out twice... can we stop the madness with any comparison to the real GOAT... I mean even dimwits should understand this undeniable fact.
Pan comido!!
"Good evening, the Champs are here!!!! E-A-G-L-E-S!!!"
Did mahomes make a single complete pass ?
"But Jalen Hurts cant throw ..,"
It was Cooper Dejeans birthday also that night

"Eagles aint winning ten games, eagles will never win a ring, eagles need to fire Nick, eagles are done. Well now looks like everyone else is eliminated but us."
Been saying all year you dont win close score games & think you going to just get by when facing an elite team they been frauds from the start of the season
Eagles defense and the chiefs over thinking Saquan is what made this game over from the second it started.
I thought the Chiefs were supposed to be a halfway decent football team. You couldn't tell it by this game. They were dominated on every level.
The Eagles defense showed up this Superbowl. congrats Eagles.
thank you philadelphia for destroying the death star
What a bore
Flyfly love my Phil eagle Super Bowl shoes
Wish the ravens were here
This was a embarrassment!!!
Bro yall always say refs be cheating for the best team the chiefs but how if the chiefs get more flags
"Dominant D line will always win against the Great QBs. Manning against Seahawks, Brady against Giants teams and Denver AFCCG Peyton's last year and Cam was unstoppable til the Denver defense stomped him out, and Mahomes has been beaten in 2 Super Bowls because of dominant D lines. The only answer to a Dominant D line is a great O line and Game planning to neutralize that D line. That was evident here in this game. Eagles only scored 23 points not off of turnovers and that D line caused them all. The fumble was a roughing the passer and should have been called. Disgusting the NFL lets go! The NFL changed the rules for the Bills multiple times over the past few seasons and they still can't get there. Congrats to the Eagles and someone in that D line should have received the MVP! Good luck next year to all of the teams. The Chiefs still have won 3 of the last 6 Super Bowls! Good luck repeating that!"
Everyone can see how that disaster happens....
0:49 is that a good I love it too I love for me to come and be happy to see on my mind I don't know what to do I don't I and I think is not but it's a little better to be honest and not to much but I urgently do some things that way I love to the
Mahomes is a G for those flawless passes
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Grown men got spanked and cried on tv that night
Celebration from eagle fans were crazy ya should have seen it
cheesesteaks for all of you.
This game was so sold 0 on 3rd period for KC
Rumor has it that the Chiefs fans are still at the stadium waiting for their team to show up!!
"Hopkins needs to cut all them snakes out of his hair and return to manhood, and learn how to catch."
I'm responsible for about 30k views on this video lol go birds!!
15:57 if ya think about it if Jalen did not pop Mahomes in the face Pat probably fully throws and rips his arm off. So he should thank Carter for showing mercy
"That absolute DOT by Jalen to Devonta was pure cinema. Beautiful arc on the throw by Hurts, fantastic catch by Smith with a defender on him, after which he somersaults into standing upright and immediately flips the ball to the ref, who catches it at the highest point as he signals touchdown! Fly Eagles Fly!!!"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Jalen Hurts needs to learn how to smile, talk and act human!"
"Eagles played a good game. Chiefs didnt show up at ll. 1/2 time sucked and the commercials were not convincing, entertaining or subpar."
The Eagles are cruel role models. They finally won a game and theyre so shocked. They should be! Wont happen again!!
On 3rd and 6 14:13 that should have been a illegal foward pass
Go Birds
Just came here because Messi was there
You mean all those state farm commercials didnt do anything?
This game was an absolute fever dream for both sides.
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"

17:38 what name did commentator say here Dave who??????
Could've easily been 16-1
I dont understand The game of American Football but I still watch the super bowl every year .
CMON YOU BRIDS
Nothing like number #6 scoring and telling the Crowd in his hometown this my 13:22
The QB play is horrible any more in the nfl.
Its crazy the chiefs shouldnt have gotten that first td pat was past the line when he shovel passed it to kelce
Mistake found: in the logo of this video it says 2024 instead of 2025
Bills robbed
Josh Allen the real goat
31 teams are celebrating the Philadelphia win LOL Particularly the San Francisco 48ers
"Very well-balanced game. Sometimes the Eagles was beating, some other times the Chiefs was get beaten."
As a Eagles Fan Your Welcome They had it Coming We Lost to them 2 Years Ago And Didn't Take it Lightly And WE GOT THE JOB DONE
Tip my hat 2 da defense
John Elway and Jim Kelly each have 'only' 3 Super Bowl blowout losses on their resumes. Patrick still has time to be the greatest!
Crushed it! Go
"eagles did what we could not do-redemption the second time around. 49ers couldnt beat KC the second time around but Philly had revenge on their minds, eagles D and hurts took over the game"
"I have never watched an NFL game in which their were no blitz, no stunts, no extra man in the box, and yet dominated. Yes, the Eagles won as a team. However, their front four of the defensive line deserve huge credit. Because they only needed to rush four, the secondary always had an extra man or two on every pass play. I noticed on many plays, there were six guys blocking four rushers. Amazing!"
"Chiefs needed a brake tho, they got a lot of solids plays and slick moves."
Boy they wasnt giving Mahomes a break sack after sack
Look what happens when its too big to rig. Congrats boys you deserve it.
Worthy to any other team. Kelce is washed
Where's devil worshiping Taylor Swift
No 3 pleat this year back to square one for.the chief's and good luck .
Brady's reaction at 1:20 is what everyone was saying but in their own words
"After the game, I wondered, was it Karma? Mahone's wife, Mother and some teammates being Vocal in their support of the current administration. And that administration's efforts to Eliminate DEI? Which, had it happened when Mahones was in college, would have eliminated his shot at being a quarterback. I wonder how a wife and Mother could support ideology that considers their husband and son as Less than Human because of his American African blood. It's very strange. Their support of white supremacy. Karma."
Eagles highlights
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
"Good AFC teams were made to lose through referee calls and projected ""insignificants"" Chiefs as AFC champs. It should have been Bills or Texans"
"TRAVIS Kelce got bullied , he cant pass or run block 5:59 and 5:50 is 2 of many examples during the game"
7:00 66 became the Eagle's 12 man and tackled Mahomes
I can watch this over and over.
Of course Atlantis is real that's why the olympic games exist because the Olympic Gods of Olympus/Hesperia(Mallorca) have to do with Atlantis you simpletons.
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
"D line, hurts legs, and accurate throws when need be won us the Lombardi"
Ill ll be 100% honest I was scared for our offense .but I trusted our defense..they were gonna keep us in the game.. but man this defense went beyond my expectations.. our offense stepped up specially Jalen. This Defense eagles is one of the best defense teams ever
"At 13:00 I legit thought to myself, now that's an @$$ whooping, how sad...and I'm a diehard Eagles fan"
E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLESSS
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Taylor Swift getting booed was the biggest highlight. Kenny Pickett has more NFC Championship Game snaps and Super Bowl snaps than Dak Prescott.
Don't say so much Fake .
"Finally, the chiefs lost after a long time and a another team win the super bowl."
This entire highlight package i seen one hand-off to perine or any run game with chiefs. Eagles d got em playing catch up from the jump. No run game.
"Chiefs might not have won, but I still love them"
Amazing content as always!
The post TD toss and catch from Smith to the official at 13:11 is pretty cool
"Thank you, God, for giving us an early birthday gift ."
Shouldve let Jalen Hurts and the starters check back in for victory formation kneel
I am just watching but not understanding a thing
Mannn to Beat Brady/Belichick & Mahomes/Reid those are some real chips! Congrats Philly! Go Birds Baby! Hurts dont it
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Bills go robbed!
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
This was the best superbowl Ive ever watched in my entire life.
Chiefs should have called Brady down halfway through the third quarter...I'm sure every Pats and Falcons fan would agree.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Chiefs got screwed so badly I thought I was watching a Diddy freak off.
Amazing content as always!
"Dude has the ENTIRE stadium saying ""A-Minor"" that's just diabolical."
Congrats Eagle fans! Philly embarrassed the f out of KC and stop them from achieving 3 peat!!!
"The best part of this highlight reel is that it includes very, very little of Bradys word salad."
Too bad Steve Deberg isn't the Chief's QB anymore
After watching hurts really didnt do much.. his o line did and he was a beneficiary of a couple iffy penalties..
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Ive never been so happy! GO BIRDS
"niners fan here. never liked either of these teams but thank you, philly, for stopping a mahomo three peat."
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Pass Int call was really bad - refs interfering with game!
"I dunno, as a Fan of neither of those Teams, it seemed really rigged, It's like watching WWE knowing that everything is staged."
this sport is fantastic!!!
"Two bad quarterbacks made the Superbowl a really ugly bowl game. Congrats, Eagles, but it was a bad football game"
Best eagles game EVER made kc look like a high school team go birds 2025
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"Looking to run some clock, OR MAYBE THROW THE DAGGER at @13:00 was the best part. What a play call, what a play, what great commentary."
This is the most satisfying and entertaining super bowl that I have ever seen in decades.
The play by play call on the Devonte Smith td was epic.
My dislike for the Eagles is more than the Chiefs. And then I remember it is the fanbase and the celebrity stuff I don't like about both teams. Good to see a different outcome and Eagles team step up.
Man Deandre Hopkins is just a sad story. Tried to be a journeyman and it failed smh. At the biggest stage in football and he drops a wide open pass... just wow. Really goes to show never ring chase cause its never guaranteed. Larry Fitzgerald stayed with one team and has more honor and credibility than Deandre Hopkins will ever have. Fitzgerald is HOF meanwhile Hopkins will be known as just a nice player that wanted to ring chase
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"""Who else loves that adrenaline rush? If youre into extreme sports, Ive got some wild content for you! Lets connect! """
Tom brady would never
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Its the way they lost thats whats makes it so sweet
The Buffalo Bills need to take notes on this game so they know what it takes to beat the chiefs and go to the Super Bowl next season.
Eagles two bowls are some of the coldest of all time imo. Both came against the team of the decade patriots and chiefs.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
Saints 2026
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Mahomes makes a better quarterback for the Eagles.
Bekungancengwana la.
The Refs just didnt want it bad enough.
"Mi fa piacere che sia passato questo video su questo canale per chiedere al NFL Pensate anche a noi europei visto che lo guardo fin da quando ero bambino e sono diventato vecchio con il superbowl difficile fare le 5 della mattina se non sei abituato, ormai,anche solo un ora prima sarebbe tanta roba. Comunque grazie avete inventato uno sport stupendo,al tg hanno fatto vedere che passato da noi Dan Marino sarebbe stato epico poterlo incontrare invece essendo Italia non lo ha pensato nessuno PS il touchdown del 33 stato concesso secondo me il 62 lo ha fatto scivolare fra le mani, un uomo che pesa come una moto, e ha segnato a me non mi ha convinto,va b"
Beaten by a bunch of rowdy dwarves Maybe there is a God Jk
Who won?
BEST DAY EVER
what under the sun is this game?
"Chiefs got manhandled the entire game, WOW"
POV: the nfl isnt rigged
"Texans fan here, thank you eagles!"
This game did every human being a faver
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Im so glad the chiefs lost so bad
The greatest Eagles game I have ever seen!
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Cooper dejen first white corner for a pick six in a Super Bowl
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Defence was too much outclassed chiefs and Mahomes had really no chance to play that day.
This was the real Super Bowl
KC choked hard
I've watched this 4 times. How did KC even make it to this game???
How many times yall watched these highlights so far ?? Im on my 11th
Finally the refs were neutral and not favoring the chiefs like theyve done all season long. And it clearly showed who the better team was.
"On a side note, please never use that scoreboard design again. Its not good"
They humbled them
"The game was super balanced: the Eagles beating, the Chiefs taking a beat"
Just fuqn BEAUTIFUL i literally shed a fuqn tear when my eagles WON!! GOOO BIRDS!!
Mahomes is 0-3 in big games whenever Brady is in the building
13:04 no fear
13:04 no fear
13:04 no fear
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"That Defense was outstanding. No blitzs, otherwise it would have been a different game."
That Smitty TD pass congrats eagles!! Fly eagles fly
Watched these highlights 1000x and its only day 2 after the game
GO EAGLY
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
6:18
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
6:18
6:18
Hopefully my Saints can get back into the playoffs with Kellen Moores play calling
18:43 The moment I lost my $1K 0-0 Super Bowl box
"the best chiefs player was the rookie worth, he has nothing to be shame of"
"For 3 solid Quarters, Eagles defense had better defensive efficiency over the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, 1985 Chicago Bears, 2002 Tampa Bay Bucs, all time great defensive units in the Super Bowl and in that exact order as well. Until our backs up came in and Chiefs ran the score up to 22, for 3 solid quarters, our overall defensive efficiency going into the 4th quarter made us the greatest defensive team to play the Super Bowl what a dominant performance"
<exhales> Does anybody have a cigarette?
"Wait, wait wait, I thought we were playing the Kansas City Chiefs, not the KC Chefs. Lmfao lmfao lmfao lmfao."
Greatest hate watch in NFL history Quite possibly the most satisfying Super Bowl beat down ever
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
My favorite Super Bowl besides Super Bowl 50 and my broncos
THIS GAME REMINDED ME A REPEAT OF SUPER BOWL BETWEEN TAMPABAY BUCS AND THE CHIEFS WHERE THE CHIEFS LOST. BUS TOTALLY DISTROYED CHIEFS LIKE THE EAGLES DID.
vic fangio had probably the best defensive gameplan in super blwl history
love the Eagles
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"Well regardless of what Mahomes accomplishes going forward, he's been blown out in the Super Bowl twice. Not once did that happen to Tom Brady. When he faced his largest deficit, 25 points, he won that very game. Anyways... hopefully the Mahomes vs Brady debate can end now at least until Mahomes is nearing the end of his career."
18:42 yeah what throw to little to late
Amazing content as always!
loved witnessing the chiefs lose
at 14:16 mahommes is forward of line of scrimmage should have been called back
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
*END RACISM!*
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"I only watched when the Eagles had the ball and it was such a smooth & clean game a well deserved win Dotson was a nice secret weapon, Sweat, Carter & the other 2 who sacked Pat were relentless. Saquan sacrificed himself to be a distraction. AJ, Devanta, Dejean were outstanding!!!"
Supporting Eagles and they won
not even brady could of clutched dis
Thank you for the great content!
NFL had to flip the script so they can keep the sheep at bay
The Eagles won this game before it even started. Love my Eagles
"One thing I have learned in my 35 years of watching the NFL is it doesnt matter if was Troy Aikman, Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes. If you keep a constant pressure on the QB they will make mistakes and you will win the game. Simple as that. The Eagles did just that and scored a lot of points off of Mahomes mistakes."
Kendrick got more youtube views
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
The Eagles safe the NFL
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
AJ brown is the best wr in the league he so dominant any qb who have a feild day especially the elite passers
Just pure domination. Fly. Eagles. Fly. The Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl LIX Champions!
"Oh no, we lost the game. Darn it"
To see the face of Patrick Mahomes during all the game was priceless and pure gold... good job Eagles !!! Congrats
Je ne suis pas un fan des Eagles mais l ils ont domin et survol cette finale que ce soit en attaque ou en dfense : victoire amplement mrite et merci eux pour le spectacle ! Greetings from France !
greatest game ever
https://youtu.be/cXs2CW_efeg?si=iOG44ypYKkUQGM0q
As a european i've got no clue what i'm looking at.
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
They got beat 40-6!! 14 pts came from them playing our back ups! KC got spanked
That Cooper Dejean pick 6 was
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"""Mem-ories are made of this...Sweet Sweet, the memories you gave to me!!!"""
"This is how the world feels when either Brazil, Germany or Argentina don't win the world cup of football (soccer)"
awesome finish well done philly
"as european I never liked this game but the way Eagles played kinda made me like it now well done , booing on TS was a cherry on top"
"NEVER EVER compare ""His Holiness Our Lord and Savior Patrick Mahomes"" to Tom Brady ever again."
*Can we PLEASE get a halftime show that is representative of most of America???!!!! Not some hip-hop artist on an ego trip and using the show to further a personal vendetta!!!*
Amazing content as always!
Everyone happy besides the Chiefs and their fan girls
Both the O'line and D'line hugging and dapping each other at the end of the game as a sign of respect is what I like the most. All those big men went up against one another for the longest!
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
As a NE Patriots fan. THANK YOU PHILLY!!!
Its crazy cuz the chiefs really werent winning by much all year
"Wish I could see it for a fair price, but guess I live without."
Eagles!!
Eagles defence were insane. Mahomes couldnt do anything against them. Some of their blitz plays were nuts.
THE EAGLES ARE SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS 2025
The Field goal that was called off because of a penalty is one of the highlights? What?
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles winning Super Bowl LIX.
"Yeah, the post season is definitly not rigged."
DECKED!
"Me anunciaste ese aparato muchas veces, No lo comprar"
"Trying to imagine any pregame speech involving the Eagles, particularly from Hurts and this is what comes to mind: 2 years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost the Super Bowl. We lost coordinators. We lost a part of ourselves. Tonight we have a chance to take it all back. Offense, defense, special teams, you know your teams, you know your assignments. Get the Lombardi. Bring it back. One round trip each. No mistakes, no do-overs. Some of us have been here before. That doesnt mean we should know what to expect. Be physical. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And were going to win. WHATEVER IT TAKES. Good luck."
Wow did not expect the eagles to win
What an absolutely dull sport. Imagine having to have a concert at half time to keep the fans awake. Cheap copy of rugby with too many stops and way too much padding for mens sports.
South Korea sos sos sos This is a recent election fraud that occurred in Korea We fold the ballot in half and place it in the ballot box. Election fraud occurred due to ballots allegedly being automatically restored to their original state during early voting I'm a flyer expert There is no paper in the world that automatically returns to its original state. South Korea's democracy has been destroyed. Let the whole world know Democracy collapsed and the president was imprisoned. Please protect democracy in Korea. I'm crying
"Ive never seen or thought Id see a KC offensive be this weak , of course full credit goes to the defensive line who just dominated the chiefs never seen a Super Bowl over going into the 3rd quarter, the eagles looked so much bigger and stronger than the chiefs all around"
dominate /dmnt/ verb/ have a commanding influence on; exercise control over.
40-6 at best for the Chiefs. Eagles too the foot off he gas after that
America won
Finally exposes the fake nfl
What a difference in defense from 2023 to 2025. That Pick 6 was B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!
Can anyone explain how Hopkins missed that catch at 9:17? It almost looks like he's not even trying to.
Fly eagles
Real score: 40 to 6
This defense will go down as one of the greatest in history. Fly Eagles Fly BABY!!!!
Was Taylor in the stadium? I didn't saw it.
Thank God. I was so sick of seeing The Chiefs win every super bowl
can we all agree that brady sucked on color commentary?
Smith with the perfect toss to the back judge after his touchdown...
Glad the chiefs lost
Time for Kelce to retire. Gronk will always be better than whatever the hell Kelce was this game. Gronk always came through.
I've watched this 15 times already
How you get Kendrick and NOT Drake.... huge fail
16:13 98 slap was everything. Definitely chuckled lol
Lady was in the stance using a voodoo doll on mahomes is nasty work #PhinsUp
The Chiefs are who we thought they were!!!!!!!!!!!
"I thought this Superbowl would be close, tipped the Chiefs to nick it. The Eagles were unrea6"
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"Hey, at least the chiefs won the coin toss!"
18:04 My fav play
This game was basically the whole NFL community vs chiefs and refs
Didnt waste my time watching
Thank you from a dolphins fan!
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
NFL needs an embellishment penalty like Hockey. McDuffie sold that OPI
At 2:12 if he wouldve threw it to Barkley he wouldve got past the first defender and been gone
Mahomes is not what everyone was making him out to be and finally its come to light
We did it Philly
Go Birds
13:00 Maybe favourite play of this game
"As a Chiefs fan, the fact that they ended up in the SB is awesome to see. We eeked by many games throughout the season, but the coaching and Mahomes and team helped us get us there. You can't deny that. You can hate on them all you want. Getting to the SB 3x in a row is something special. Winning it 3x proved to be impossible. Eagles played their hearts out, and proved to be the best team this year. Well deserved. You can't deny this Chiefs team is a dynasty with the amount of playoff wins, and SBs and runs they have had. We will be back. There's some tweaking to do Still proud of them boys! Just an off game... keep your head up Chiefs' Kiingdom!"
The Eagles GM is the true hero here!! What a team he put together.
He really scored on his birthday on the superbowl talking bout amazing
"When Brady was down 28-3 to the Falcons, I tweeted in halftime Belichick will make the adjustments and WIN the Super Bowl. I said this was over after the first quarter. It was exactly like the Bucs/Chiefs SB."
"Chiefs shouldnt have been there, bills vs eagles wouldve been much better"
Ive never seen a team so unprepared for Super Bowl in my life.
49ers fan but thank you Eagles best Football game superbowl Ive ever watched
"Well, same choppy officiating just a better result in my opinion"
"5:48, absolute ELITE blocking by kelce..."
"Well, there's only so much the refs can do."
Backups and third strings getting to go in for voctory formations and wrapping up the SUPER BOWL! What a team. FLY EAGLES FLY
THE OL FUMBLEROOSKI
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
The eagles finished there story
Congrats Eagles
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Eat that Taylor Swift
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"Mahomes used to run to the sides when the box collapsed. For some peculiar reason, he was running in the box and being squashed again and again"
Now I feel like crying my eyes out because last years Super Bowl didnt go like this for the Niners
""" man i feel like the refs weren't calling late hits on all thise sacks"" patrick maybe mahomes lmao"
How Was Mahomes This Off His Game Something Smells Fishy
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"This wasnt a Super Bowl, it was a massacre"
"Brady was disappointing as a color announcer. Whining about obvious penalties like the offensive PI at 11:37 in the first quarter that were called, otherwise bland or biased towards KC until they were well out of contention. Get robot man more training or get rid of him ."
POV: ROOKIE MODE on madden nfl 25
"Why nfl rigged I, saw the final score is at half time Should the screen shotted and posted it. Pats all over agaign"
"Next year I want to see either the Bills, Vikings or Lions in the Super Bowl. America is hungry for new champions."
"As a Raiders fan, thanks for taking that Frog out!."
Scoring on the 2nd team defense will always be hilarious to me
"Whiy is called Superbowl? The league should call Black Celebration Day! Only black singers dancers,players,other Latinos Asians white, doesn't belong here! Let's all stand in our gret and applause those black man and woman that are dealing with so much racism in our country!My asian Latinos and white people lets celebrate black day, because we don't deserve nothing, they deserve all, lets be ruled by them! What a shame nfl becomeed! That's diversity ,only black? Don't deserve a from my time to waste on your craaopoy game! NFL"
I havent watched the highlights from superbowl 57 yet but Ive watched this 3 times already
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Eagles D-line won this game. Don't get it twisted. Absolute domination.
I never seen a Super Bowl with this wee hype and excitement from both quarter backs they both know. Even eagles coach at the end of the game looked like if he just got demoted lol Gambling will take over all sports.
"I have never enjoyed Super Bowl as much as this. Eagles, you guys are heroes Thank you for winning P;s 22points on Chiefs was mercy given by Eagles."
That smitty TD was the definition of send it.
Nick let Jalen out his stray jacket again!
"Even sitting in the booth, Tom Brady is still Patrick McHomes worst nightmare.."
Bruh this sport is boringg
This was Amazing
Glad the eagles won!
Eagles d turned up man
15:40 refreshing
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
You don't need to be a crypto expert to realize you can change your life and be wealthy investing in XAI315K now
Everyone loves some humble pie
RIP Philly infrastructure
This game felt so good to watch.
Thank God for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide
The 4th quarter was just a pre season game for the eagles lol
The Wings of Hell !!
Greatest game ever! LOVED This game! Best Super Bowl ever! Love my Eagles!
Hottest crypto in the market = XAI315K
"after that BS PI call, the eagles defense went berzerk on the chiefs."
How about the Eagles kicker who had to double make so many field goals and didn't miss once. That's icewater in the veins.
Script was changed for Eagles to win...all because of all the backlash from the fans....NFL is the new WWE....
?
Literally so tired of the chiefs thank god
That first call was definitely a call that was dumb. The refs was trying to cheat for the chiefs
Healthy investment for 2025 = XAI315K.
Canada is one of the biggest holders of XAI315K coin. Is it because Elon Musk is from there? xD
This Patriots fan enjoyed every second of watching Chiefs get bulldozed.
"My dad would tape the games in New Jersey and mail them to me in Japan, Australia and the Philippines. Constantly watching 2 weeks behind. But never missed one! Took a lot of smack talk from 49er and Redskins fans"
KC were paper champions
When the Kansas City chiefs lose America wins
They Kansas city swifities caught dat belt this what happens when theres no refs kissing mahomes and its real football no script just dominace jalen hurts outperofrmed mahomes when he lost and won mahomes mac jones level without the refs
Stop investing in MikeyMouse projects and invest into XAI315K token. A REAL utility crypto coin.
Not only did Philly win but America also won
The Chiefs were not prepared for the Eagles. Mahomes was sacked or rushed every time he had the ball. Time of possession between the Chiefs and Eagles favored the Birds .
the amount of ads is insane
Time to get hungry again. No more commercials. No more Hollywood. No more ego.
Feeling Better After Investing $50K Into XAI315K
Patriots are still the best dynasty
"I'm only buying Bitcoin, Solana, and XAI315K."
"Rams fan here. Saw this game neutrally. Congratulations to the Eagles. It was a Dominating win. Cannot believe we played them better than the Chiefs. - Eagles Defense deserved the MVP. Jalen had a typical day. - i am kind of glad the pundits won't be talking about Mahomes being The GOAT and comparing him to Michael Jordan - NO ONE had Over 100 yards of production, except the usual: The QBs; that doesn't count. I repeat: No One had over 100 yards of production. - Jalen Hurts has the fun loving, jovial and gregarious personality as Bill Belachick and Nick Saban"

"I'm Not A Sports Fan It's Nothing But Money Now,, I Was Going For Kansas City, The Browns Should Stay In Cleveland Ohio No Excuse For Moving"

When are the pales gonna realize that sports ain't for them ???? Yall lucky we let yall commentate the games . Thata why we doing every half time show and that's why a dark-skinned qb won !!!!!
NFL games has been proven to be rigged
If XAI315K isn't on your investment portfolio yet you're not paying attention
"What a wonderful advertisement for ""socialised"" sport."
The fact they said they let chiefs score at the end and didn't care was madness
You mentioned XAI315K being the best crypto investment this year. Can you make a new video on updates? We want to hear!!

This was the best game ever!!!!
Thank you Chiefs for the free therapy session.
Great video! Do you still consider XAI315K the best crypto investment for this year? We all want to know!
Comes to show how KC was never even in the league. To play in the Super Bowl. Should have been the Texans or the Bills.
CHIEFS WERE FRAUDS ALLLLLL YEAR. GO BIIIIIIRDS!!!
I tripled my portfolio with XAI315K investment alone...
Chiefs Fan Here. Congratulations Philadelphia Eagles on winning the Superbowl we will be back
"Invested 5,000 XRP into xAI315K and Never Looking Back"
Investing in XAI315K is similar to marrying a wonderful wife. Picking the new flasy meme coin of the week is like choosing a mistress. It usually does not end well.
I could watch replays of that 4th quarter strip sack fumble smack on Mahomes all day everyday. Way to go Eagles!
Great Video! BTW amazing call on investing in XAI315K. I'm up 200% already and it's just the beginning.
I was rooting for Eagles but happy for Xavier Worthy for those 2 touchdowns. Making Longhorns proud
Well done the Eagles.
Only alt coins have collapsed. Bitcoin is dipping but XAI315K coin is going parabolic
"""Can't say anything about the refs now"" says D-Hop as they're down 34-0 in the Super Bowl"
I don't see any other perfect time for one to invest into crypto specifically XAI315K than now. Buy and Hold XAI315K now.
GONNA FLY NOW

"It is all fixed for profit, do not be decieved. The entire NFL is on big corporation which can legally fix any & all scoring."
Eagles were the better team all year long. Wish the Lions had been healthier going into the playoffs. Would have loved to see a full strength Lions/Eagles matchup in the NFC championship game.
I was hoping for a better game than that but I guess it was too much for the Chiefs this time around. Great game for the Eagles though congratulations Philly
Bringing backups into the superbowl is diabolical...go birds!!!
Go eagles!
Amazing content as always!
The Eagles exposed Chiefs. Showing how they were just an average team that shouldve been 5-12
Real score is 40-6
If you're new to crypto - XRP and XAI315K are your best bets
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
*The halftime performance was actually better than the GAME*
I didnt watch a minute of this game and Im glad. Refs are WAY too trigger happy and its wasnt even a game.
"It's pretty clear to observe two things from this game The Eagles defense played every down as if it was 4the down, because it was personal of how they were screwed 2 years ago. Justice was served of the Eagles getting their revenge and it was very sweet to watch too. Congrats Eagles"
Tom Brady Signature Here! Hahahaha
If you aren't invested into XAI315K by now you'll miss a huge train you wish you were on...
"While the Eagles players and the coaches were practicing hard, the chiefs were too busy making commercials. Bundle Rooski anyone. GO BIRDS!!!"
Most satisfying super bowl ever. But haters will still hate. Keep doing. Fly EAGLES Fly!
I was bored at home so decided to watch the game and see what the hype of football is all about and it was the best game ever!!!
I believe XAI315K will defeat bit coin
EAGLES LFG
XAI315K = Millionaire Maker
Fly like a eagle
I have been watching you for years and bought my first btc before the run early 2017 around $900. I bought my first ico around the same time $PLR. I am huge into crypto and could not agree more that investing into Elon Musk's XAI315K is the top notch investment that will yield 50x-100x potential. The future is digital and AI is leading the way.

That hand to the face at 15:59... So satisfying
"Three-peat denied, revenge complete. Way to lay the hammer down on the Chiefs!"
Nothing will beat the first Super Bowl but this is so so so so so close.
"This Superbowl reminds of the time they played, Tom Brady and the Buccaneers . They couldn't score a touchdown throughout the entire game, due to the lights out defense."
They were humbled
"I'm done with the NFL, now that they support racism and a fascist."
the only stats that should only count for pat mahomes is in the first half
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"The NFL became as unwatchable as the nba with this awful product. Kickoff, racist halftime, dome stadium, restricted defense, gambling etc. I turned it off late 2nd quarter and listened to the great radio broadcast by Kevin Harlan who tried to make it better than the boring game !"
19.5 minutes of highlights!
Invest into XAI315K if you want to retire early. Mark my words
NFL Eagles Chiefs
"The Eagles have been doing this all season. We knew once we scored 55 against Washington in the NFC champ game, that it was a wrap for the Cheifs."
"Enjoy it guys, soak it in, be merry! there will be another 10 to 15 of 15"
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Eagles just gave them two free touchdowns for pity
Those chiefs tackles were extremely awful
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"I didn't watch the pooper bowl, so figured I would watch the highlights here."
9:04 one foot??
"Like an eagle, rise above the storm and soar high"
The mainstream media has not caught onto XAI315K yet... Once it picks up news the token will skyrocket
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
This game showed just how good the Eagles were and it really showed how bad the chiefs were this season when the refs weren't bailing them out
Too bad Hurts isn't a authentically black qb ryan clark isn't gonna be too happy hahaha
"So, a team that went 15-2 during the regular and postseason stepped into the most crucial game of the year only to gain 49 running yards, be sacked six times, intercepted twice, and lose possession after a fumble."
Get ready to make big bags of money investing in XAI315K
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Now lets see if the Eagles can get the threepeet!
"the poor chiefs were in a psychological no win situation after their meeting with the eagles in the SB two years earlier. a ref decided the outcome of that game in favor of the chiefs, so this game had no other possible course but for a drubbing. that ref ruined both games, but i am happy for eagles fans. fly eagles, fly!"
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"

Jalen Hurts > Josh Allen
Super sad game
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"In my final comment of this game, it's pure dominance by Philly on both parts of this SUPER BOWL ,and I give a lot of credit to the coaches, watching reruns of past games, but Philly will add another ring to the players, but I am going to watch the next NFL draft, but no NEW YORK TEAM has made a impact on their roster, but now my look is at the NBA, with the KNICKS, AND NETS,looking pretty good, don't forget about LA LAKERS, with LEBRON and his son. But I also think that KC has nothing to be ashamed of, as they were going for another ring, nothing."
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Chiefs QB is terrible
"Its obvious that we give the big star players their praises but the ones who dont get any recognition throughout the season, stepped up big time in key moments this game. . I love giving the underdogs their credits"
Congrats to the Eagles. I am not sure what happened to KC offense. KC showed they could score against Philadelphia when they need to but they showed up too late in the game.
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"

Imagine saying youre threepeating at the parade last year and then get embarrassed on the big stage. Mahomes redefining the name choke artist
A lot of people are saying that this was like the bucs and chiefs but its not even close. In that game Mahomes made more positive plays with his legs and overall but this game was complete dominance. One could look even say that Mahomes has lost a step since that superbowl.
I like both teams
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
The final score was 40-6. Junk points dont count mahomo
Amazing content as always!
The Eagles fly!
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Chiefs true colors without their refs help
Brady talking about the pain of his defeats not gloating about his victories over Mahomes was classy. Thought he was much improved on his comms duties during the SB.
Me watching the entire highlights and not understanding anything.
The Highlights Of This Game Has Way less views Than the Kendrick Lamar Halftime Performance! That Really Says A lot To What People EnjoY.
I love my eagles but im gonna be honest. The d-line hasn't been that dominant all season or they havent had a great game like that maybe twice this season. We have some good guys but usually its one person having a great game not the whole line. I havent seen any chiefs games this season and after this game im really wondering how in the world did they almost go undefeated?!
"I see that ppl dont know that Taylor is a Eagles fan, she wears red when her bf plays, this time she didnt wear cause it was her bf vs her team, so u can stop crying. W Eagles"
The eagles beat the cheifs like a college team winning their championship game and let the backups come in the game and close it out... dam
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"I am so happy for Jalen Hurts. I do not know what happened in Alabama but, I am so glad that he has a Super Bowl Ring and Tua Tagovailoa does not."
I cannot understand anything don't know how to count the score
Kenny Pickett Super Bowl MVP
How can the Eagles be World Champions when only American teams compete?
I felt like Brady was loving it but then the game got so out of hand he started feeling bad for my Patrick mahomes.
Eagles lost to the patriots then they beat the patriots. Eagles lost to the chiefs then they beat the chiefs
"In this part of the video, again another very bad call by the refs,in this game, that's why the NFL has implemented rapidly has instant access to looking at any bad call, even though I have nothing to do with their job as a person I have my own opinion on this game"
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"

What a boring sport

I had no idea the Eagles won. Some weird sites posing as the game here in the UK. Scary. Thank you for this! Way to go Eagles and Philly

that was embarrassing.......
Now when can the Phillies win a World Series??
Mahomes was basically playing alone out there against an entire team
Cheifs def was horrible and dat all dey is to it but go chefs
Gonna rewatch this at least 15 times. Does the heart good seeing Travis Kelce and Patricia Mahomo getting humbled
Thank you for the great content!
"Is it just me, or does Tom Brady sound like hes losing his voice at 13:22?"
I am not an eagle fan but I favor them over chief
"Not so easy when the refs dont have your back, is it?"

"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Che schifo di gioco
Jalen hurts is closer to mahomes than mahomes is to Brady legacy wise.
"nesse dia todo torcedor do bills era eagles,"
Mahomes at the end is not the same as the one the start of the game
"This sport is very dumb, 95% of tackle and 5% of game I dont understand you Americans"
Hearty congratulations to the Eagles team. I always felt they will win. They brought their A+ game. Every player did their part. They shoved Chiefs EGO to where it rightfully belongs.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Wtf - so boring even watching the highlights
Worthy deserves his flowers that gamekid didnt give up!!!
"Mahomes didn't wet the bed, he defectaed in it"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
How is this game played?
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
As a lifelong Chiefs fan. This was an abysmal performance by mahomes and the offense. Also an outstanding performance by the eagles. Satisfying.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Can we talk about how that ref caught that ball perfectly at 13:12?
15:44 Go Birds!!!!
Thank you for the great content!
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Wtf is this game. And did they really say that this is bigger than the football world cup?
Getting the Backups put in on you in a Super Bowl is beyond disrespectful
QB
"Hello, Humans Don't wait for humans to respect you. Instead, respect yourself. That's all you require. TERRANCE OUT"
That ball flip Devonte smith did to the ref after he scored that long touch down was so cold.. ref didnt even have to move arms out of its a touch down sigh
Now lets not get complacent. Get key free agents and work to get back to the Super Bowl!
I truly believe chiefs threw that game
I just found out that eagles were not only in the superbowl but my boys actually won it ?!?!
All I can say is Philly really showed the Chiefs some brotherly love.
And some well say this is better then real football
Watched Eagles grind up all teams ( AFC north ). That defense was the very best in Pro Football this year ! Eagles Quarterback is most underrated player in Pro Football ! Super Athlete ! Super Competitor ! Watched him play many ball games at Alabama ! Congratulations Eagles !
"Philadelphia, Disney World is yours"
Chuck Bednarik and the Dutchman are smiling up in Heaven
"This super was an upset everyone knew that the eagles had a good chance to win nobody expected that it will be this dominant, was a great super bowl to watch, unexpected outcome"
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"The Chiefs were scripted to win, then the plane crashed."
The things they say about Hurts are all the things I saw out of Mahomes. Lol
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Mahomes never beat another Superbowl winning team. That qb is not better than my qb. Hurts always looks better against Mahomes. And Hurts has the advantage in head to head matchup.
Pat mahomes going to get rid of his whole o-line
Thank you Eagles!! And congrats on winning the Super Bowl!!

"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Is that Sam Darnold in a Mahomes mask
Thank you for the great content!
This is the 5th Super bowl I watched and this was the best but I didn't like the chiefs doing last minute game cheats and winning the game but this time it was different when eagles won this time. Thank You Eagles.
This just goes to show how difficult it is to do a threepeat. Not many teams can achieve what the 4peat Bills did from 1991-1994. Their record is safe for now.
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"What I find life affirming is NFL fans everywhere, not even just Eagle fans, are celebrating the thumping KC and certain KC players got. There just seems to be a collective sigh of relief we won't have to see 3-4 certain KC players (and coaches) EVERY time we turn on the TV! This team just had some certain smugness to it that was so off-putting.....let's hope it's decades before the are relevant again."
Always hated swifties well done eagles
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Chiefs couldnt cross midfield until end of 3rd quarter, unbelievable. Eagles defense were just too much for KC"
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"THANK GOODNESS the mumbling, fumbling and frequently cannot complete a thought Tony Romo didnt do the game. The man who says Jim 30x a game!!! Why is he still on the air!! He was a fair quarterback and the same as an announcer."
Too many ads
incestuous sport
Scripted league
"I know the Chiefs weren't clearly dominant this season, despite their record - winning like 16 one score games - but, this game was just baffling... We got two insanely competitive games against the Texans and Bills in the playoffs, but in this Super Bowl it's like they completely forgot how to play. They did literally everything wrong. Just embarrassing. The Eagles clawed us in every possible way. Absolute blowout - complete domination. Congrats Philly."
KC did not get beaten. They got whomped and mutilated by Philly. Great game. Great offense and defense by the Eagles. Kudos to Hurts and the entire team. And the town of Philly!
As a 49ers fan I've never liked the cowboys but the chiefs I hate these guys the gratification I felt watching the Eagles abuse kc congratulations Eagles never thought I would say that
I cant understand why people watch this nonsense. This is not even a real sport. Stick to the real
KC CHEATS FINALLY GOT DA BACHI OF YEARS OF REFS HELPING THEM.THEIR DONE!! LOL

WHAT A BEATDOWN! EAGLES WIN THE SUPERBOWL AND STOP THE 3-PEAT IN DOMINANT FASHION. FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
Mahomes looking like caleb Williams
Rugby leauge guy here this game is to slow.
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Chiefs played so bad the refs couldnt even make calls to help them even though the refs tried
"For the first time everunless it was against Dallas(Always root for anyone playing against Dallas ) As a Commanders fan, I was rooting for the Eagles and Im not a KC hater. I just dont think they deserved to be there. I think Buffalo wouldve given the Eagles & the people a much much better Super Bowl and if you disagree? Well we can agree to disagree! Congrats Eagles!"
5:32 how is that on the offense thats unreal
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Why is no one talking about how it says 2024 on the thumbnail
Chiefs down
Scripted
"I am a Chiefs super fan , but the Eagles were better than good, on both side this time . There were perfection, maturity, cohesion ... What a great victory, one for the Ages !!!"
if jalen had mahomes numbers at half.. i dont even wanna see what would of been said about him
This game was so disrespectful . I was honestly hoping that the queefs would at least score a field goal so they didnt go out 40-0
Tom Is not good
somebody tell those ringless bums josh allen & burrow to step tf upp
"Mahomes was throwing way too low most of the time, no one was defending him, he was taking too long to figure out whether to throw or rush, and kept trying to rush half the time. Also, as a Chiefs ""fan"" (mostly cheering for them for Taylor Swift lol) I gotta say *why* did the *Eagles* get the false start penalty when it was clearly the Chiefs who did that?"
Now stop shoving taylor swift down our throats
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"8:35 The pass, and celebration was cool"
Absolute cinema
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
The Formula for beating the Chiefs has been delivered!
the superbowl wasnt just for the eagles 24
The only thing worse than the chiefs were the woke commercials
Press 8
Gets better every time I watch it

Packer fan here.. I was pretty happy watching that beat down.. even though Philly beat us. lol
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
The one time I build a parlay Kelce shits the bed
How is this a sport??..leave alone being entertaining??
The 3 tds by the chiefs were just sympathy points from the eagles lol
This sport would be so interesting and appealing to most non-Americans if it wasn't stop-start.
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"

65 literally pushed him towards Mahomes
Eagles
This is so shameful tbh
OMG the D line was insane roided out all nite. No stopping them. Great effort from Patrick Mahomes tho
You take the money rather than making history. What a joke!!
This proved that the Chiefs can't win without the referees help. They tried in teh beginning but the refs couldn't make it to obvious. Chiefs should have never made it to the Super Bowl.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"

although a pick six on a birthday is very cool
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
super bore compared to grey cup with a 1-point game at halftime
4:24 Barkley telling everyone to calm down after this interception shouldve been THE HIGHLIGHT. He managed to keep everyones head in the game. True leadership by Saquon even though he couldnt score a touchdown.
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Not once did they show on tv the camera pointing to Andy Reid lol...
15:45 JC slapping Mahomes and Chiefs fans' dreams of a three-peat down at the Superbowl.
7:02 Knocking over your own quaterback in the Super Bowl is wild
"Oh as a rams fan, not even an eagles fan, this is refreshing"
Well the KC defense said saquon wouldnt get 150 yds rushing just too bad they still gave up 33 points tho (not counting the pick 6 of course)
"The halftime show was absolutely un-be-f'n-believeable ""RACIST"" and the performance just showed how much these individuals hate America. (just like in Superbowl L)"
"This Eagles team is stacked. The few players I wish got to get this W is Kelce, Cox, and Boston Scott."
Life long chiefs fan here: The Eagles played on a whole other level that night. Chiefs didnt stand a chance.
I started looking at the UFL schedule at halftime of this game because I knew it was over.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"Rewatching it, on the pick 6 mahomes threw that back across his body. He's always making dumb throws like that, it's anti fundamentals you are NEVER supposed to throw back across your body like that on the run because it's supposed to get picked, it's just nice to see him punished for it"
Eagles wouldn't allow the refs to take over the game
Amazing content as always!
"The NFL said No MV3 for Lamar Jackson. Philly said No 3-peat for the Kansas City Cheats. As a NFL fan, thank you PHILLY"
As a Broncos this was fun to watch. Ol Vic had those guys playing hard.

Good job refs
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
24-0 haltime score is unbelievable to all Kansas City Chiefs fans. State Farm wasn't there for Patrick Mahomes.
This was like watching Conor get smashed by Khabib
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
I am a Chiefs fan so I see this game was satisfying for you but it was only satisfying because your team cannot make the Super Bowl and always losing but if your team has not been to the Super Bowl 5 times out of seven years you should not be talking and the Chiefs won three Super Bowls out of those are facts. A lost doesnt mean that the dynasty is over you saw when the Bucs beat us we came back and won two Super Bowls we beat the Eagles two years ago they beat us so we are even 1 & 1
All the weapons he has and still couldn't put up a fight I mean an alstar cast wide receiver core and couldn't score more than 6 points until eagles put there second string in
eagles delivered a whooping
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
I've watched this an unhealthy number of times
Good thing those Refs from Arrowhead were not there
I won 200 dollars from the Eagles winning
12:00 kelce just standing there not trying to block or get open is crazy his money line hit at least
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"Chiefs defense actually minimized the damage, this game could've looked a lot worse."
To easy to to easy whateva ole boy said
Cheifs fans hows that for ya
This is a satisfying game
"If Mahomes had Allstate instead of State Farm, he wouldve been protected from mayhem like this!"
Amazing content as always!
Seriously three full ads to start then 1 minute then another 2 full ads by the end of this video I had seen at least 9 ads - this is madness - YouTube calm down in the ads . At one point I couldnt even remember what video I had clicked on because there were so many ads . Relax on the ads dude
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
That pick 6 was insane. Good job eagles. America wins.
Steeler fan here. The Eagles literally CRUSHED KC. What a defense!
Dont let us get Myles Garrett
NFL needs to hire a better director here.... it's too obvious a worst performance on a stage on tonight game ? we all know the chiefs gonna lose --everyone was putting their $$$ on the chiefs.....
14:06 not like it really matters but how do they miss that call
"My brother was reminding me ""Ayye and it took the avengers TWICE to beat Thanos"" Hats off to you Philly and Great win."
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"My mother is why I am the Eagles fan I am today! We celebrated Super Bowl 52 together! I lost her in 2022, 6 months before the Eagles lost in Super Bowl 57. This is my favorite moment in my personal Sports history. Thank you, Birds!! And I know she's up there celebrating!!"

"40-6 was the real final, as Eagles rested their starters after that. This was a beatdown, BTA."
Well I got to admit that Mahomo isnt invincible like everyone thought. He is a great QB but every great athlete finally blows their load and starts showing theyre just average. Only one that was the total package was Dale Earnhardt. Now he was the best ever and never lost his greatness!
"This was super helpful, thanks!"

This game was a snoozer. Thats what the nfl gets for carrying the chiefs to a bunch of Ws they never should have got. Bet the ravens or bills wouldnt of got blown out this bad.

When you go to work and see how quiet the Chiefs fans are today. Thank you Eagles !
"49er faithful , Philadelphia you was the stronger team this year and you took it straight to the super bowl and dominated congrats to you but my boys will be back next year if we healthy all teams on alert my 49ers coming through you already know"
really impressed by eagles d allthough chiefs played shitty ^^. revenge for the stolen superbowl and the rediculous holding call. too bad the kelce brother who had deserved it not playin anymore
Non-Chiefs fans eating good!
Bro y'all stop being rude that chiefs lost and I know that but it hurts me to see everyone telling me to shut up when they hear chiefs
congrats eagles. what a season. steelers need some love
*Game was rigged. I need you to find another 19 points.* --Diaper Don
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
"This was such an egregiously terrible performance by the Chiefs, that I hope somebody is fired for this and a massive going back to the drawing board is in order. Yes you can say, Eagles were that good, or not. But to show up at the Superbowl, to then put that performance down at this point, shows even further what we 'think' is organic, may not be. This was like somebody literally turned off the Chiefs, as if given a stand down order. I overall wanted the Chiefs to win sure, but I'm not really a fan. But this was a middle finger to longstanding fans. This Chiefs was most definitely not a Superbowl worthy team this year, they should be ashamed and make whatever changes are needed so this never happens again."
Watched this game four times already and I still love it
Talk about a beat down
"KC, you now know who is currently the best team in the NFL. It's not you. You got SHUT DOWN in every way possible."
J
"GO BIRDS, SEE YA'LL AT THE PARADE"
Awesome game . Congrats Philadelphia Eagles
Bruh cheifs 19:12
7:07 even 66 grabs him haha
"If mahomes had allstate , instead of state farm,he would been protected from mayhem like this. Lol."
I knew Josh Sweat was good but he manhandled Kelce and whomever was attempting to block him all night. He's about to get pizzaid.
What a time to be an eagles fan
Lamar at home watching the game and popping his zits
What a game! I guess KC and Mahomes aren't invincible after all! Being humbled is a good thing.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Talked ta Lamar
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
I am a Chiefs fan good game Eagles congrats...
Bruh when TB12 says he doesnt like that call. Its so funny bc I USE TO BE THE ONE SAYING THAT TO HIM
Am I terrible for being happy only because Taylor swift took L after L?
Proof that the chiefs did not deserve to be there
The only word i could understand in K Lamar performance was the N word.great class NFL SOOO PATHETIC. SO GLAD THE REFS COULDNT CHEAT AGAIN FOR KC
"As a German, who cares for a variety of sports disciplines, and has a bunch of great American friends, I decided to actually give the Superbowl a try, observe live what the fuzz is about. - Five long hours of my life I'll never get back! Any major sports game I've ever watched had prestigious show acts and VIP guests and some fun ads,but in the end, the event was about sports. What I saw last night was about everything but football. Massive overstimulation, obscene consumerism (what's the deal with commercial breaks at a 5-minute-ratio on US tv?), an endless series of more or less interesting celebrity close-ups, 4 guys in the off hysterically commentating the game all at once, and a winner that was clear pretty soon. ... I do congratulate the Eagles on their rather unexpected triumph over the Chiefs, but I can't say this night has made me wanna watch another Superbowl."
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"I dont know how many more times I'm going to watch this. Im sure, at least 10 more times, this this is #5 for me so far"
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
"Although not perfect, the refs actually did a pretty decent job."
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
Bro that O-Line are MONSTERS !
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
Best Super Bowl ever.
That Zach Baun pick was a thing of beauty lol
Go Birds!!!!
I will forever love this team!!!!!! Fly Eagles Fly
"Sooo sick of chiefs,andy reid,kelce+the rest of the chiefs.the nfl and the refs giving them wins forever.sick of taylor f'n swift.the eagles knew they had to beat them badly to take it out of refs hands and they did just that.they beat the snot out of em"
Still cant believe the Seahawks didnt run the ball
"Chiefs had an easy schedule,they only had to beat the bills, thanks to the refs they won that one"
Yea but they don't call the offsides when my texans miss the field goal
Travis Kelce out there running routes like Travis Scott
That last two point conversion cost me and extra $25 on top of the $70 Id already won on my squares.
"The NFL is faker than wrestling. Have you ever considered why the refs never get admonished& fined for a call? A player gets fined for wearing a pin& in 55 years of watching football, I've never seen a ref get a fine once. I might be slow, but this year, I finally asked that simple question& the only thing I can come up with is that the refs are doing what the NFL wants them to do"
"I'm not a sports fan, but I'm a lifelong Rocky fan and a fan of Philadelphia, so I'm excited and glad that y'all won again! Congratulations, it was an awesome game and a much deserved win!"
Obviously it was the elder Kelvrr that was holding the Eagles down
"Jake, Dotson, Maddox. . Are unsung heroes! Its obvious that we give the big star players their praises but the ones who dont get any recognition throughout the season, stepped up big time in key moments this game. . I love giving the underdogs their credits. . Those 3 players showed up man"
just coming back to see them lose
Amazing content as always!
Release the micd up!
Dont blame Pat for this.. he made mistakes but him getting how many pressures isnt his fault and for the defense letting up so many plays.
"I cannot tell them at the bottom of my heart, that the Eagles have done a fantastic job! I love my favorite team! Fly Eagles Fly!"
Thank you for the great content!
So glad the eagles took it all the way and won the superbowl
again agian again again again ag
Had to come back to relive the moment where a defeat happened and not a 3peat ! Flyyyy Eagles Flyyyyyy
Tom Brady was so annoying honestly
That was one of the LAMEST games I have seen.
Christmas came early with this. Watch for the comeback storyline next season.
This sport is genuinely terrible
Regular season KC would've had 3k points due to flags
SO MY QUESTION IS ARE THE CHIEFS REALLY AS BAD AS THIS OR ARE THE EAGLES BETTER THAN THEY LOOKED ALL SEASON?!!!!!!! NOT A TRUE BELIEVER!!!!!!!!
"Ok, but that Cooper DeJean read was insane"
I was not expecting pat to throw a pick 6 lol. Super satisfying to watch as a 49ers fan
tom brady is still da goat.
DeJean turned the tides forreal
Halftime performance was worse than a 10th month abortion.
"The chiefs forgot to pay the ref . They were treated the same way all the other teams get treated when they play them. Always playing dirty and getting away with it, i never understood it. They got what they deserved"
"I've read a lot of jokes about Mahomes for getting sacked a lot but Chiefs line just observed how Mah gets under the train again and again. They just couldn't do anything with Flyers charging at him, they seem like a team from another league."
U can tell the eagles said F the script. Let the best team win
GREAT WIN As a EAGLES fan WE GOT OUR LICK BACK FROM 2years ago FLY EAGLES FLY
That ball to Hopkins and his two picks were all behind his targets. Mahomes wasnt ready. Period.
Made them boys looks like they didnt belong in the super bowl
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Amazing content as always!
"At 1:54 p.m., Western time, this had 5.4 million views now its at 6.7 million. Let's make this the most viewed NFL video."
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"13:02 is my new favorite Eagles play of all time. The turnover on downs, and then we get to this moment - up 27-0, where the clear thought in everyone's mind is ""burn clock"", but the Eagles had other plans. 27 points wasn't enough, and they just pull out one more haymaker to level the Chiefs for good. The commentary too...""Now the Eagles get it back, they're gonna run some clock...or maybe just throw the dagger! Hurts, going deep, for it all, Devonta Smith, HE HAS GOT IT!!!!"". I'll never forget that moment."
3 sacks in a row then an interception is crazy work
Ngl the fans seemed loud af!
I bet Bills and 49ers fans are loving life rn
The greatest game Ive ever witnessed as an eagles fan. Dominating blowout on the biggest stage to win a second Lombardi. 52 was sweet but this one is sweeter
"As one who does not like patrick mahomes And is also a cowboy's fan... This super bowl sucked. So I didn't bother watching. Here's to all the eagles fans out there, #DC4L"
You can't win a football game tipping off that you're going to pass or QB keep every down. In the Walter Staubach. .
Eagles front 4 was scary this game. Hell of a performance they put on. They came out swinging and never looked back
Ive watched this like 10 times so beautiful
"The Eagles have a secret weapon. It's their defense. I have seen them take on Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Green Bay, La Rams, Washington and now Kansas City and those teams don't know what happened to them. The only thing KC did was pretty much shut down Barkley. But Hurts can run and throw himself. If Barkley is cut loose he is good for two or three touchdowns by himself."
KC got licked and I was here for it!
"Never in the wildest dream of Eagle's fans and worst nightmare of Chief's fan, would this Super Bowl turns out this way."
Hand it to the Eagles D scheme. They never blitzed but kept pressure on Kelce the entire game - designed plays for him to release were eliminated with constant defensive pressure on his side
What happened to the kc they were so good now they are bad
"Philadelphia won because: Jalen had all day to throw. Patrick had no protection. Eagles kicker was fantastic. Eagles D was big, huge ."
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
Yeah screw Mahomes!!!
The game was intense. I wonder what Taylor Swift would say about it.
"To the people that say Mahomes is Jordan, Puh-leeeze , dont disrespect His Airness with that nonsense because Michael Jordan NEVER looked like a bum and NEVER lost in the Finals."
This could have been 54 - 0 if they wanted it to be
Wow the Chiefs got annihilated. No way were they going to win with that many sacks and interceptions from their QB.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Not a chiefs fan and not an eagles fan. I just think kelce should retire on this. Reaching a high note and retiring like his brother.
um it was clearly aj brown as mvp. so stupid
"I kept waiting for the Chiefs to go on a drive, simplify the game and by the time they started to, it was WAY TOO LATE. Eagles gameplan was PERFECT. Incredible Defense. Congratulation Philly."
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"Hey guys, who you thought was gonna win the Chiefs or the Eagles in the second one you have to go out last Friday?"
"I need my glasses, Is That's Caleb Williams with a Wig."
The Swifty era has ended
Never been happier to see an Eagles win.
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"ThaT FLY BY, HAWKS On HIGH....Lost Directions, can't SAY WHY"
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Amazing content as always!
It was cute watching the first minute or 2 when the chiefs players still thought they had a chance. They were crying before half time
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
What's up with that generic looking scoreboard
"Eagles were the underdogs, when doubted they show up & show out!!"
Amazing content as always!
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
The refs still cheated for the them. That 1st touchdown shouldnt have counted. Mahomes was pass the line of scrimmage on that toss to Kelce for the 1st down
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Jets jets jets hate them chiefs rather bills eagles final Kelsey wasn't swift today ha
That D line was INSANE
"if only the Chiefs had hosted the SB at Arrowhead and got blown out, that would have been even sweeter"
It was nice to see the Chiefs get put in their place. If it wasn't for the help of the refs they would have never been in the superbowl to begin with. They didn't belong there.
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
I like the scoreboard
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
So much for Mahomes trying to break one of TB12s records lmao
https://youtube.com/@no_option-i6e?si=LQtt37FY-jozQA7I
GO BIRDS! FLY EAGLES FLY!
See what happens when the officials are not paid off in favor of the Chiefs. Someone said The Eagles 14-2 team playing an Chiefs 8-8 team just got schooled. Congratulations Eagles!
Its the Taylor swift curse . Kelce aint have no completions till end of the 3rd quarter.
The eagle playin like its a madden game
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"Getting there is one thing, winning is something else. Mahomes is still young, and I'm sure he will get to the Super bowl again. Kudos to Philly."
What a boring game .. FAKE football
GO BIRDS!!!
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
I want to credit the refs for giving us the fair and square Superbowl game lol.
Amazing content as always!
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Even the 13 KC Man on The field in stripes couldn't save KC this Superbowl !
Eagles D-line had one of the most dominant performances Ive ever seen. They were pressuring Mahomes on every play before he could even catch the snap.
E-G-L-S-E-S!! -mayor of Philly. Lets go birdsss
The NFL saw all those clips with the refs making calls for the chiefs and changed their agenda.
That was so satisfying
Thank You Philidelphia Eagles !
Hope swift pegged kelce nice and hard after the game but in all seriousness at least noone got injured in the game except the chiefs souls
Now The whole world knows that Mahones chokes under defensive pressure every time !
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Worst halftime performance in Super Bowl history.
"No 3 peat, Not even for Vince Lumbardy because one was a NFC championship. 2 and Out baby !"
Eagles are the world's Super Bowl 59 Champs!!! Congrats
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Man, I cannot believe how disappointed I was in Mahomes. Six sacks, and two interceptions"
One of the least competitive SBs ever played. Chiefs offense couldnt move the ball. Eagles offense utilized the rest of their stars not named Barkley to embarrass KC. Game was over at halftime. Chiefs had no answer for the Eagles defense. Pitiful display. Boring game.
I'm gonna watch this highlight video all summer long. I love it!
Ain't nobody going to KC
KC can shine the shoe's for Philly next year !
Amazing content as always!
Kansas City is a joke
Thank you for the great content!
FLY EAGLES FLY
"Millionaires playing a game for their billionaire owners. No, you silly naive fans, they aren't playing for you. LOL."
Rigged....watch those sacks slo mo....they allowed those sacks. And that int for the td. 2 obvious purposely missed tackles. Idk why anyone watches this. Its like wwe
super rugby americas
That's what I'm talking about Phillies referees
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
I think that The Dead skins can beat KC.
"34-0 late in the third. A shutout until The Eagles started celebrating and sent in their benchwarmers. Although the Chiefs did not play very well, Reid and company were thoroughly outcoached with no plan B to neutralize the expected pass rush."
NFC Rules The NFL !
"As a niner fan, congratulations to the eagles for winning their second Super Bowl by winning against the chiefs"
What is amazing is how A lousy Reed team has two Superbowl wins with a lousy team like KC to begin with especially with Mahones the choker.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
This is my 6th time watching the highlights today. Go birds
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
I said before the game that All Philly needs to do is pressure Mahone and He would choke. Mahone has always choked under defensive pressure.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
13:05 when jalen threw that bullet we all knew the chiefs were done
Has to be one of most flawless SB performances ever
Let's go eagles 3:29 3:29 3:29 3:30 3:30 3:30 3:30 3:30 3:31 3:31 3:31 3:31 3:31 3:32 3:32 3:32 3:32 3:32 3:33 3:33 3:33 3:33 3:33 3:34 3:34 3:34 3:34 3:34 3:35 3:35 3:35 3:35 3:35 3:36 3:36 3:36 3:36 3:37 3:37 3:37 3:37 3:37 3:38 3:38
A thing of beauty is a joy forever - My man John Keats said that
Philly was being nice to let them score at the end. They easier could have shut them out completely !
I think that I enjoyed that as much as the ice bowl back before the Superbowl
"Fly Eagles Fly, Fly Eagles Fly!!!! I love my team, what a game BIRDS!!!"
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
I was originally not going to watch this but I ended up going to a Super Bowl party and so glad I did because I enjoyed every minute of seeing the Chiefs get destroyed.
fhhhhhhk the chiefs!!!!!!
"Lets be honest Mahomes is not even close and never will be on the level of Brady and Montana, the dude already has two horrendous 2 sb blowouts where he played worse then a rookie"
Let's go
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"Final score, Philadelphia 40, Taylor Swift 22."
They were super bowl champs 2 years ago!!
Why this dude keeep gettin sacked by 4 man rush?? Someone explain
"""We're gonna run some clock- or THROW THE DAGGER"" Best call I've ever heard"
"As a Steelers fan, I say Thank you Philly for crushing these referee-protected golden boys once and for all!!"
"The eagles are just super lucky that the actual 3 best nfc teams the lions cowboys and San Fran all had major injuries devastating ones had they not, Philly certainly would not have reached the sb but got blown out by one of the three teams as cowboys and 49ers did to Philly last year, Philly is the fourth best nfc team"
"Rocky IV: ""You see... He (Mahomes) is not a machine! He's a man!"""
"The Chiefs had a chance, prior to the 1st quarter."
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Glad I skipped this game.
The NFL rigged machine actually decided to let the talents play and see who actually can win(they did try though)
Eagles made it to big to rig The refs did try though lol
CHAMPS!
Hope this was a Swift lesson
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
2025: Chiefs win in the divisional but lose in the conference; Andy Reid loses weight and shaves the moustache 2026: Chiefs win in the wild card but lose in the divisional; Travis Kelce finally admits he is g*y 2027: Chiefs lose in the wild card; Mahomes gets traded to the Giants 2028: Chiefs don't make the playoffs... for the next ten years
AJ hit the Jameis Winston Slide
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Eagles' defense was absolutely filthy... one of the best super bowl i have seen.. they held the cheifs down WITHOUT any blitzing...
Thank you Philly
What's better than one ring... TWO RINGS!!!!!!
Rigged. Fake news. Was like wwe
6:31
Glad for the Eagles to win. But what the hell was 52 of the Chiefs doing at 6:58??? What kind of play is that??
Amazing content as always!
"To the MFn Philadelphia Eagles and their fans in attendance, Raider Nation loves ya baby"
Final scoreline flattered the Chiefs This was an annihilation
40-6 is a wild score !!
Cant wait to watch and listen to the mic up Super Bowl
"It is embarrassing that Jalen Hurts has already won a Super Bowl before Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen where those two QBs were Drafted before Jalen Hurts, and still to this day both Lamar and Josh still yet to reach a Super Bowl appearance in their NFL career."
Philly defense got all eyes on ball stop run and short passes and stacked and interceptions thats how you play defense is eyes on ball and quarterback
Eagles Kicker Broke Adam Vinatieri's Kicking Record. All them Field Goals he Made Yesterday.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Chief s so worried about Saquon so badly but remember Philly have all the weapons they need
Mahomes was not on
I am KC fan. We are happy for Hurts and the eagles for the win. Hurts really deserved it. Hes been ballin since he entered the league. See u guys next season. Go birds!
Legend has it Taylor is still twerking
I cznt wait for the Mic'd up to come out. Go Birds!!
Tom Brady won this. lets go Bucs.
Still meat riding mahomes while he down 20 is crazy
"NFL, gave us KC. Look like a 15-1 team? Nice halftime show guess bud light and disney wasn't on your radar?"
The defense won the game they played the hearts out
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"6:31 ""Patrick one of the best in the world?"" Sure didn't play like he was the best."
Steal more eggs.
Fly eagles fly to slap the Kansas City chiefs
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
HAHAHA i bet so many people lost crazy amounts of money betting on the chiefs
"Brady isnt a great color commentator, and the fact that he said he didnt like the call on AJ Brown... come on dude, if that was called against his opponent back when he played, he would have loved the call. It was a textbook offensive pass interference by the Eagles. But the penalty on McDuffie was a bad call, one of the few bad calls the Chiefs suffered from. KC just got frustrated and got penalties and from what I saw, the Eagles played mostly clean. No late game controversial calls, not that it would have helped the Chiefs as they were down too much."
"Finally the refs were not playing for the chiefs,and they got what they deserved"
I'm just glad we don't need to call him Hattrick Mahomes
Don't run the ball or anything.
1:53 kelce gets absolutely clamped by a linebacker one on one trying to run a seam route. Gronk is turning that play into 20+ yards. 5:52 kelce got smoked on that block directly caused mahomes to get sacked. Then the next play same thing kelce gets absolutely smoked and caused a mahomes sack. 14:44 gronk is catching that 11 times out of 10. Kelce couldnt hold Gronks jock strap. Never was a real debate but for all the delusional chiefs fans this should settle it.
Mahomes worst game in history; what the hell happened ?
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
To the powers that be: please invite Chris Brown to perform at the Halftime show NEXT year!!! Please!!!!
Never gamble guys.
lol. Kenny Picket...
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
No more pretending kelce is better than Gronk. Dude was running around out there like the chiefs found a they/them at a pride parade and put a chiefs jersey on them. Kelce is a rub-route merchant who couldnt block a middle school bench warmer.
"Just shows, even in an offensive league, Defense wins championships"
The refs couldn't save em this TiME !!!
"Once Coop did that pick 6, I could see it in Mahomes eyes, he was mentally messed up, just couldn't recover. But how about my QB though!! The one people ragged on the entire season!! Want to shut haters up? WIN! PERIOD! FLY EAGLES FLY"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Excuse me Chiefs fans but your favorite team couldnt be the first team to win a 3peat. Yall were too hateful to achieve that honour .
We will be back and win it next year and I hope its a rematch with the eagles and idk what happened we havent played this bad all year but we decide to in the big game
"You know that Eagles defense did a great job to stop Mahomes and Chiefs offensive team when they couldnt score any point for almost three quarters. Then they scored 22 points in a quarter, that shows how perfect Eagles defensive team did their job and how great Chiefs offense actually is."
"Looks to me like the only reason the Chiefs even scored is because the Eagles having such a big lead and so late in the game decided to relax a little. If the Eagles would have continued the pressure they had until the end the Chiefs wouldn't have scored at all, shutout."
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
The final point (chiefs)22-40(eagles)
Chiefs really only scored 6 points the other 16 came on the back up players! I love it!!
"I'm making this comment everywhere: Hurts, don't it?"
This is truly the most miraculous game i witnessed in the history of NFL. Absolutely satisfying to the soul. Long awaited.
Everybody was talking like this was a huge upset. 20 minutes before the game started someone asked me who was going to win. I checked to see which team had the number 1 ranked defense. Philadelphia was #1. K.C. was ranked 9. I told them that Philadelphia was going to win. I predicted the final score would be 43-27 Philadelphia. So I wasn't surprised by the final score.
We gonna see how many chiefs fan are there cheering
"Props to Eagles defense, because theyre the ones who won the game for Eagles. They kept Chiefs pointless for almost three quarters. They had 16 pressures, 6 sacks, 3 turnovers, 2 interceptions and one touchdown."
"Patrick mahomes clearly threw this game,of course the eagles defense is dominant but nfl is so scripted man lol but great win for Philly they deserved it"
"8:27 upon further review, we have determined this was a catch by Worthy"
Bird flu didn't get the Eagles !
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"Eagles are doms, chiefs are bottoms"
Kansas City got spanked
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
OMG! I was crying half the time cause Im a Chiefs fan.
The noise was all eagles fans. It felt like an eagles home game @13:06
birds baby
Chiefs needed to get their egos checked.
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
6:16 cooper pick 6
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Glorious!
7:01 Patrick Mahomes got sacked by his own teammate
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
We need the Viet guy in family guy yelling scoreboard
As a raiders fan thank you eagles for giving KC a taste of their own medicine
Nobody thought it would be so one-sided
This game shows how much better the NFC is this year compared to the AFC. The Eagles could have beaten the Bills and the Ravens too. The Commanders could have probably beaten those AFC teams as well.
man we really won the bowl and qb1 got mvp what a time to be alive
"What a beat down, 40-6 in the 4th qtr. tells you the whole story. D-Line dominated the game and Jalen Hurts was unleash! Lets go"
GO Eagles
"THE STADIUM WILL NOT SELL OUT NEXT YEAR, THANK YOUR PUBLICISTS"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
GO
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"This was a masterclass from the Eagles. Offense, defense, and special teams all made huge plays. Total domination."
can't think of a less deserving team & fanbase. Of course they tried to burn the city down last night.
Parabns aos Bravos Valentes Guerreiros do Philadelphia Eagles - Bicampeo do SuperBowl 2018-2025 ! Esse Time o orgulho da Philadelphia - Dos Estados Unidos e do Mundo Todo ! FLY EAGLES FLY
"mahomes is a sore loser after the game tured on his own team mate perine, glad that fraud lost,without refs chiefs wasnt even a playoff team"
Fly eagles fly so glad they beat down the cheatin chiefs
"tbh the scorebug has kinda grown on me. at first I was like wth but since my eagles won the superbowl with this, it kind of has a special place in my heart now"
"Trumpists lost, America won!"
Travis couldnt block for his dear life he should retire
"""There will be no 3-peat."" ~ Pat Summerall"
I have 4 words for the chiefs:offensive & defensive linemen!
"The Eagles D played better than expected. Mahomes played the worst game of the season, exacerbated by the sea of green jerseys chasing him."
"I thought the Eagles were cooked after that OPI on AJ. But to be fair, the stink surrounding the refs helping Mahomes can be put to bed. They did nothing for them in this game."
"Here's a professional TV announcer who still hasn''t figured out the pronunciation of the name ""Xavier"". Three syllables, really?"
"This was glorious, just glorious"
don't be mad travis you can still get the real dub off the field ;)
Im happy that the Chiefs LOST!! Thank you Eagles!!!
When you're a Cowboys fan and you can't decide whether you want the Chiefs or the Eagles to win:
To add....was so happy when Swift got booed
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
18:17 wouldve off been cool in the first half
I guess swifty money wasnt good enough for the refs this time
Too big to rig
This game was sad to watch for chiefs fans. Thankfully I like the eagles.
Give the Lombardi to the Defense Coordinator
Say Drake I hear you like em youungg
I love it when patrick cries
What a beat down! Love it
This was a amazing game. I think cooper dejean should of gotten MVP.
Head up KC. There is always next year. The Kansas City Swift will be back.
Fly Eagles Fly Super Bowl 59 Champions! So proud of My Boyz! See you Friday on Broad St. 215

Eagles defense had Mahomes looking like a Vietnam Vet with PTSD
Boria ed arroganza.......hanno preso legnate da costanza e spirito di squadra
I think Williams (Nr.93) has deserved MVP.
Goodness. Chiefs got exposed
GAME OVER
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
When the refs finally realized you are not worthy of their blessing 16:08
The eagles defense was absolutely amazing.
"Tom ""I don't like that call"" Brady"
One of the greatest defensive performances in NFL history period
Mahomes unlocked his X factor in the last quarter
This was a repeat of SB 55 but waaaay worse for the Chiefs.
What an embarrassment for the chiefs
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Man only if the offensive line for the Kansas City chiefs would INITIATE CONTACT INSTEAD OF BACK PEDALING. GET UP ON YOUR GUY WTF. PUSH HIM BACK I CANT BELIEVE THAT.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
"As an European, I have never seen any funnier game than this. Whoever watching this sport has no self respect"
As a chiefs fan was super impressed with hurts and the defense but Mahomes til played solid just needs more talent
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"This is how I really would look if the league wasnt helping them out, but not like this because we are the real squad we made him look like what they really is average and truthfully speaking this was suppose to be our 2 ring in two years if we wasnt robbed out of that one two years ago but thats over and we proved it again whos the real squad"
This super bowl was truly truly a Philly thing God bless
Worst Super Bowl ever and boring Im glad the chiefs lost though
Go eagles amazing game

"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
"You can tell women have infected the NFL higher ups, new rules order, and completely feminized the refs. What are these penalty flags about?! Might as make the refs throw red tampons."
"Tom Brady needs to retire @7:21 and 17-0 Eagles he says ""They (Eagles) haven't been able to do much today against this very formidable tough Chiefs defense."" HUH??? Then within minutes it was 24-0 I guess the Eagles did something Tom."
"Said it from the get-go! Pressure, Pressure, pressure!! TB did it, & look??!"
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
What a dominant performance across the board by the Eagles...next up...will they swap Siriani for Kellen....I won't be surprised if they do...or if they pay him big $$ to stay....
It was awesome to see chiefs fans leave early instead of seeing them get spanked . GO BIRDS
Sorry homes!!
"No 3peat, beating KC and boing Taylor Swift priceless!!!"
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
LETS GOOOOOO
Bucs and Eagles got solution to make Mahomes like average rookie QB Fantastic 4 DL is answer haha
this looked almost identical to the Tampa super bowl. what a masterclass by the defense
"Epic stop to 3-peat, pro-chiefs calls.cant wait 2025 season!"
@15:42 Jalen Carter tried to blow the doors off Pat Mahomes
"As a Bills fan, I am so happy for Eagles!!!"
That front 4 for the defense was nasty all night long
Do we remember a time years back when not one eagles receiver could catch a pass? Ohhh how time heals all wounds!
FLY EAGLES FLY
That was one of the worst beatdowns in NFL superbowl history.
So happy the eagles won..
Remember Patriots vs eagles super bawl? yeah you are not him
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"The Chiefs were tired. Do you know how many playoff games they have played in the last 6 years. Fatigue will eventually overcome you at any age. Mahomes looked tired and confused. Also, the Eagles defensive coordinator Nick Fangio has excelled as one, almost every place he's been. Chiefs stuck at 2 straight. Like a whole lot of teams. The Dallas Cowboys could have had a 3 peat. But Jerry Jones said: 100 other football coaches could do your job, of something like that. Mr idiot owner! As long as he's their owner, they will never get back into even the NFC championship game. That's just fine with the Eagles fans!"
What's up with this graphic? It looks terrible.
I can't stop watching this. The best day of my life. Can't wait for Broad Street
"It couldn't have been done better, boo yah"
"Thank you Eagles! Sincerely, a Patriots fan"
"The Eagles are like kratos from God of war 3, Destroys the entire world, but defeats an evil bigger than them, and restore hope to the world."
15:45
"Are you kidding me ?! Swift a kind-hearted soul ? Listen to all the angry, vengeful songs she's written abt folks who crossed her: ""Look What You Made Me Do"" against Kanye/Kim K, ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" against Ex Harry Styles, and most notably, ""Bad Blood"" against Ex bestie Katy Perry. These are all well documented. Swift a kind-hearted soul, what a LAUGH"
"At 7:01 it looks like Patrick Mahomes was hugging defense player number 66, play this video in slow-mo"
"That was just such a massive beat down! Superb performance by the Eagles. I'm a Cowboys fan from Dallas and the Eagles have always been a huge rival, but I have always respected them as a very tough team even back in the old days. So congrats to the Eagles!!"
"not even with referee help chief couldn't""n win .."
Yo kelcy needs to be traded bro he didnt even make an effort after half time multiple plays he litterally stood there didnt move wtf
Cheifs did just about as good as the Yankees did against the Dodgers
even the replay is great to watch. Fly like an .
Spank.
"Im not much of a football fan, but I cant help getting Pumped up for the Super Bowl. As I watched the game, there were many times where I couldnt help but cheerGo Team!"
Been waiting for a KC takdown like this all season. Brady sucked as a commentator.
"What did Travis Swift do? Oh, I mean, Taylor Kelce?"
CHIEFS LOSE. AMERICA IS HEALING!
Superbowl Hangover...
"From a New England Patriots fan, thank you Eagles"
7:22 aged like MILK
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Taylor swift cursed the chiefs. she's bad luck now
Nice..
This was like Germany vs brazil 7-1 in the world cup level embarrassing
As long as the boyfriend doesnt win I m happy.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
So that's what a fair game looks like
"Why the Chiefs lost, because of the BIG EGO. Go Eagles #1"
I'm a Chiefs fan and seen us losing from the beginning. Mahomes was terrible
I blame Taylor Smith
The eagles clinch there second ring pop after many years as a LeBron fan
3:53 we just gunna ignore him holding Barkley??
Let it be known. Bils would have got it worse. Nfc just bully nfc sorry bums.
"As an Eagles fan, I thought this was gonna be a long night. I'm happy to say I was wrong 100 percent!"
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"No true athlete fan every thought that the millennials Mahomes & whats his name, radio pops boy friend would be able to do the long hard work of being legends. Listen to what Im saying.. the actual work of being a legend. They never had the ability to. Thank you generation millennials for still not being able to follow through with anything. Love you."
Bunndllee..roo...skiiii
Mahomes needs to call State Farm. .
that shovel pass to kelse was beyond the line of scrimmage
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
That was a demolition. Go Eagles!!
Weak asf game
Go birds baby
LETS GO EAGLES btw taylor swift is mad
Way to go Eagles. Amazing city for a superbowl. The half time show was dusmal. So out dated. I'm sorry Philadelphia as a city is an embarrassing spectacle of destruction. Winning shouldn't be an excuse for vandalizing a city!!
"In football 3 words really matter,""speed is power""."
Nothing like seeing the Eagles Totally Dismantling the REFS. Mahomo was seeing Ghosts
"When under dog team win, make everyone happy"
Messi was disrespected to bad
how about those eagles
I'm a Patriots fan and last night i was going for the eagles and it felt so good to see the chiefs loose and they can stop comparing him to the Goat TB12
"Perfect... ...pitch, perfect game |-| good win!"
The announcers were terrible sounds like high school play by Play
Its only fitting for the overconfident team that just squeaked by and got lucky time and time again this season to get absolutely humbled by the team who found themselves in a similar place last season and learned from their mistakes! Go Birds!
"Just wanna say even though it doesnt matter, at 14:08 when mahomes needs to pick up the third down he clearly passes the ball after crossing the line of scrimmage. I was shocked that wasnt looked at watching it in real time because it looked obvious to me and it was"
Biggest offseason acquisition wasnt Barkley. It was Fangio.
What a weird sport. Nobody cares except America. Nothing exciting
"white DB pick 6 during black history month on rat mahomes head, he hood certified Coop wit da coupe"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Teams know how to expose KC now
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
FLY EAGLES FLY!
"The most dominating performance by a defensive line in Super Bowl history, IMHO. Six sacks by 4 men playing against 5? It was men against boys."
Mahomes played like it was his 1st Superbowl instead of his 5th
I didn't want this to end
Ngl no one watching the super bowl for the american football. We watching for kendrick
Whatta great game n V.I.C.T.O.R.Y.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
I know everyone is talking about the game but the editing in this video is excellent. Thank you so much. As someone who couldnt see half of what was going on during the party.
Maybe we will see less insurance commercials
We have the closest 3 peat in nfl stopped before gta6 19:03
"Hurts is unbelievable, sad that he gets look at different because he's blk and makes mistakes, but that's what makes him gr8. .we all make mistakes, we gotta stop looking for perfection because anything that's perfect ends up being fake"
It's not 2024
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
The AFL champions ship was the Super Bowl
"Green Bay had the best defense ever. Who remembers their 1930 defense? I was at that game, and it was truly one of the greatest defenses of all time. Forget the 1985 Bears that you always talk abouttruly, you guys have a short memory!"
So awesome
That was one of the superbowls of all time
Man I thought Mahomes died on that strip sack
Chiefs O Line sucked this game
Tom Brady will lose his commentary job if he keep criticizing the refs.
"i love it, that's what happens when the refs are not on your side chiefs haha"
This was just a good ole fashioned whoopin. BTA like they stole something. Were champions again!!
Shout out to Jake Elliot for having to make twice as many kicks due to penalties after struggling all season. The dude really stepped up.
"Eagles putting up 40 pts against the Chiefs is wild As a 49ers fan, thank you Philly"
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Team Eagles
"Did I miss something, sorry I thought The Chiefs were unbeatable...."
Underrated
These are the results when the chiefs offensive line ain't allow to HOLD. Bosa would've had a field day if the refs didn't allow holding in both superbowls vs the 49ers
Taylor Swift Diddy curse
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
2025 is
Play of the Game 13:04
Mahomes is 0-3 in playoff games when Tom Brady is involved.
BTA
Mahomes is across the line of scrimmage at 14:13
Like if you didnt watch the game
That Eagles defense was everything
Now that the chiefs lost everything is perfectly balanced as all things should be.
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
13:30
See Philly has a lot of black guys on there team even the white guys are black up in Philly and they love to drink Johnny walker red
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Good win eagles, but when it's all said and done, Pat will be Kobe to Brady's Jordan"
you know it was over when it was 0-27 mid 3 quarter. much fix since chiefs aint that bad.
Congratulations to The Philadelphia Eagles!
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
I love to see the season long cheaters lose.
@Nfl yall know who not to bring back to halftime. Sza gave it a buzz
"For a fake scripted game, this was terrible no matter who youre a fan of"
Why didn't the Seahawks run the ball?
"Last year they want a rematch, this year, payback time."
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"As a Cowboys fan...I thought I'd be routing for the Chiefs...then I remembered, Taylor Swift is a Chiefs fan...so GO PHILLY!"
"The point shaving from Mahomes, Saquon and Kareem in this game was wild. As long as the fans are too dumb to see what's going on, the more it's going to happen. Same thing with Luka in the Finals last year."
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
When is 2025 playoffs mini movie
Wtf is this
Nice job spending 500000000 million dollars a year on defense you pity little birds
That last throw to Worthy was beautiful
The walyzed ok mo how many people could have cut out the entire episode with the duck walk
All of a sudden its not rigged.
"Remember in the beginning of season when all espn analysts were trying to persuade the public and eagles to fire the coach because he gestured the fans out of frustration! Never listen to espn analysts, good thing eagles didnt. ESPN is joke and get so many people fired by bad publicity and in the moment story lines. From behind a mic its easy to fire people"
There's the Chiefs I remember growing up
whos here after 40-22 eagles win
"Offensive line can only be patched so much to the point of it being exposed. What happened to the running game that you guys had going in the regular season ""wasn't to bad at all"". Who do we blame for the lost."
That would have been a great game if that was bills vs eaglesCongrats BiRDs! Well deserved! Thats the result when the refs not bailing out the KC
I though the cheifs would have been playing better ;/
Brady is not even close to being a Superbowl caliber broadcaster. I'm ready for the hate from Brady fanboys.
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
This was the only way the Eagles could win. The officials would have gifted a close game to KC. TOO BIG TO RIG.
game was sold clearly
"Karma for the Kansas City Cheats. Between them playing poorly all year, the refs being in their pockets, and having Omenihu the abuser, they deserved every bit of this loss."
"I guess the higher ups who control the NFL puppets said thats enough limelight for the chiefs, mahomes brother and swift, they came together and said eagles winning. What was the bets for eagles and chiefs?"
Fkc
Is it me or do these players look like high school football players
"Good god. I didn't watch the game although I knew they won when there were a bunch of ecstatic drunks outside my window, but ... I had no idea that they almost blanked them for three quarters of the game. I love how the Eagles' best QBs always seem to be the iffy also-rans that get a shot and make good on it."
"So, who won?"
No more playoff chances for the cheating chiefs
Goodbye curse of the white shirt always wins superbowl.
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
thank you for the video..oh. btw.. the president is a moron
Most Satisfying Super Bowl Victory EVER!!! What a game by Philadelphia
I had to watch simulated.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"From a Chiefs fan, Congratulations to the Eagles and their fans. That was a thorough undressing . It absolutely stings and although I would LOVE for DeAndre Hopkins to get a ring, I have to admit as a football fan I'm glad to see veteran players like Saquon Barkley and this may be random, but Darius Slay Jr. get rings."
Watch tackle number 62 for chiefs. He literally played absolutely terrible. Multiple defensive linemen annihilated him. How is he even a pro. Man up
"This had to be the most boring yet satisfying Super Bowl Ive watched, the eagles dominating and chiefs losing was so nice, but it was over by half time, only interesting thing after the 2nd quarter was the half time show"
Kelce brother: Why did i leave the team?.
What a blowout!
Philly will have some great parade for these guys.
Total domination by Philly. KC Totally out coached. Andy is just to old and we need a coaching change and an offensive line. I am voting for Tommy Tuberfield. He recruited Mahones to Texas Tech and knows how to communicate.
"As a titan fan, good job aj brown"
"We all drooled on KC getting SMACKED for years now! Very sad it happend in the one game --- but yeah - I am so happy , for now, the greatest of all time stands solid! This Interception ... Master Mahomes was Braindead . He lost this game --- over and over."
The jean ahha.)
17:11 It was 40-6 with 3 minutes to go in the 4th.
Taylor swift drove now
How bout them dawgs
DUDE I AM A CHEIFS FAN HOW DID THEY LOSE? REFEREES SHOULD HAVE MADE US WIN!!!
Brady was never blown out in any super bowl he played in but Patrick has been blown on twice
The Chiefs defense stopped Saquon and forced Jalen to answer the call and he did. Yes the defense overall was the best thing but Jalen deserves his credit and he did what alot people said he couldn't do.
"As a Patriots fan, I know how the Chiefs fans feel. AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!! My brother texted me after we lost Super Bowl LII to the Eagles, ""Fly Eagles Fly!!!"" I got him back for that last night. He is a Chiefs fan. His wish was for his Chiefs to be so good that they got accused of cheating. The best part of this game was Tom Brady was there to announce it. Brady never lost to the Chiefs in the playoffs or the Super Bowl."
go birds
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
If you can't protect the QB you can't expect to win in the NFL.
Amazing content as always!
JORDAN MATTHEW JACKSON JR
"For all those comments about Herts not being able to get the eagles a Superbowl, I won't be entertained by you anymore."
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
Easy to predict who will win nice 2.00-2.3 odds on prematch bets
The Eagles Defense were the true M.V.P.s!!!!! Absolute Domination!!! (((STANDING OVATION))) Many Congratulations
This was the bedd Super Bowl ever
I hate to seea sell out game to me kc quater back did that. Watch all his game if yu ever see him play like that
Did you see the halftime show!? Ameroca is turning into Africa.
Amazing content as always!
Philly got a great and dominant team for year to come. Especially that D-line
Thank you Phil you gave me so much joy for beating da chiefs.
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
Imagine winning the Super Bowl on your birthday . Legendary !!!
I've already watched this 4 times as a Giants fan so happy for Saquon
Looks like the chiefs will living rent free for a while
L TAYLOR IN THE CHAT
that bs pass interference at the beginning kept me from winning $1100. OR aj brown could have gotten 7 more yards in the game
"Esporte feio, sem a mgica! Pessoas correndo atrs daquilo que s Eles veem ... 1000vz Futebol, basquete, vlei!!!"
I was hoping for a shut out.
Best game ever
"The score would have been eagles 10 , chiefs 0 in the second half if Mahones did not throw 2 pics in 1rst half . That was the game"
The Eagles had the Chefs playing scared for two and half quarters. The Chefs weren't sure of themselves until it was too late when the Eagles started playing prevent defense and the second string for the rest of the game.
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Yall did yall shi
Not a Chiefs fan but all you Chiefs haters sound as dumb as the Brady/Patriots haters did for all those years. I bet a bunch of you even liked Mahomes until he kept winning.
Since the season is over i'll rewatch this game until it return ...literally the best way to end the season
Thank you for the great content!
"When the Giants beat 18/0 pats Spag went after Brady and shut down Moss, so why didnt he go after Hurts and shut down Brown,too much worrying about Barkley!"
Worst Super Bowl ever; blowout and a lousy halftime performance. Attendees did NOT get their moneys worth
"EA Sports, it's in the game"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
"The title should be called, Philadelphia Eagles Highlights lol"
"No dog in the fight for me, but Mahomes had no answer for the Eagles defense, and defense wins championships. Congrats Eagles!"
I know enough about football to understand the game. But after the score was 34 to 0 even my 5 year old grandson knew that it was all over for the Chiefs. Still I have NEVER seen a quarterback get sacked 6 times in any game let alone the Super Bowl.
Fly eagles Fly
The good thing is that the Chiefs had a nice collection of Taylor Swift sad love songs to listen to after the game and recover.
"I just have no time for Philadelphia, but these Cats straight manhandled the Chiefs,well done Eagles."
Awful score bug
"Only reason eagles got to the sb is that dak got hurt otherwise cowboys would have won the nfc east as they always do, the nfc east daddy is Dak. So eagles just got lucky that the top 3 teams Dallas San Fran and Detroit had major injuries this year eagles were the fourth best team in the nfc"
Jalen hurts finished his story
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
pahomes
Man if the refs did their job like this the niners would have won the last superbowl too.
I so proud of my team lets go eagles
Didn't watch the game but from this highlight reel - it looks like Philly was the only team to show up. Chiefs looked like they got to the game by winning a raffle and a chance to play.
12:20 holy bleep! The chiefs were called for a holding!
A great day for 98% of the country
"Upon seeing this again, the Chiefs were playing great for 1 and 1/2 Quarters, so many key stops... Mahomes and only Mahomes sank the Chiefs in the 2nd quarter. He was being pressured, but not enough to excuse those AWFUL picks, missing WIDE OPEN receivers and instead throwing picks, again and again Mahomes calmed down after the half and played like his normal self, but the Chiefs as a whole were deflated at that point and not playing as hard as they were in that first quarter. Mahomes QB'd arguably the worst quarter of his career in that 2nd quarter."
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"This is what happens when they're helped all season to get them into the Super Bowl for that sweet, sweet Swifty money, then the refs call a reasonably fair game."
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
I honestly think the Eagles have a top 20 defense of all time. They were best defense all year and the starters gave up 16.7 ppg in the playoffs. They held one of the GOAT qbs if not the GOAT to 6 meaningful points technically 14 points with the starters in.
"Eat sh*t NFL for blocking all videos on Bluesky btw. All of you mafia thugs are going to be brought to justice, your Cowboy bookies and Indian bosses."
The title of this video should be highlight of eagles
wpw idk
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Philadelphia Eagles just amazed me I was impressed by their cool play
"The sequence of the 12:50 Avonte 4th down PBU on Kelce to the 13:00 dagger to smith took the chiefs soul. Absolute backbreaking, eagles called game while already up 27-0 late 3rd. All gas, no breaks. Complimentary football at its finest. The DAGGER play call was a masterpiece in PA passing and the throw itself by Hurts was without a doubt, the most beautiful rainbow deep ball Ive seen in my life. This game was akin to a symphony, completely cohesive sum of its parts, resulting in the most dominant SB victory I have ever since: Start the 85 Bears conversations and comparisons. This was an undeniably special team and classic SB blow out with this 2025 Eagles team proclaiming this game and season as simply; THE BEST SINGLE GAME PERFORMANCE AND SINGLE SEASON IN FRANSHISE HISTORY. Go birds. Grease the poles."
"Nine straight AFC West championships Seven straight AFC Championship Game appearances Five SB appearances in six seasons Three SB wins First Back to Back SB wins in two decades 17-4 playoff record- an entire season's worth of playoff games Let's see anybody, including Philadelphia, do better!!!!"
HOW DOES THE NFL UPLOAD VIDEOS WITH GLITCHES STILL IN 2025!!!!
I was on tubi and thought scorebord bad but thought it was tubi
Rigged
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
WTG PHILLY !!!!!
"It was good to see this win by Philly but I gotta give Worthy credit, that boy pretty much saved the chiefs this season"
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
This game is played in the United States! Very boring!
Fly eagles fly!! I was one of the only eagles fans where I watched the game but I was the loudest in the room representing from San Antonio TX
Only Drake got a bigger L that day
You can't rush only four men most of the game against Hurtz. Kept hearing how he had plenty of time. Scrambled for key yards. New defensive coach for KC next year.
You can tell they wanted to celebrate each touch but there was nothing to celebrate.
Mahomes statline: Chris Paul shoots a 3 to cut the lead to 47
Thank you for the great content!
"Justice has been served, Buffalo's Bill"
Proof that the NFL is SCRIPTED
"Love seeing mahomo get owned, what a fraud"
"Like putting the words LETS END RACISM is going to solve anything What are the people who are racist just suppose to read that and not be racist anymore. ""Too bad they didn't include that little slogan, I was really thinking about not being racist anymore, but oh well"""
"As a European who doesnt understand american football, can someone explain to me how kansas made it to the final, let alone won the past 2 years? Because the way theyre playing is painful to watch."
Congratulations to Philadelphila 76ers for winning National American football championship
That first eagles interception gotta be one of the best ive ever seen
"This match just reminded me that most of the team ""sleeps"" with their wives and girlfriends at the hotel... Chiefs players had cramp."
Taylor Swift baked a large pie for the whole Chiefs team and Eagles graciously supplied a key ingredient: humble!
Rams did better against Eagles
Aguilas campen si seor
That was a blowout.
"It looks like ""Winning"" is truly now for The Birds lol"
Patriots fan that became an Eagles fan for the night. Well played Philly!
As a giants fan guys at least saquan did nothing to achieve this win its a celebration we will take it
That was The most satisfying Superbowl of my lifetime. So proud of that team.
"Smith , always has his moment no matter what. Bro plays his part and gets rewarded ."
14:10 over the line
Amazing content as always!
Does anyone know the song in the background (5:46) ik its sounds muffled but ive heard it
I feel bad for the chiefs I wanted them to win but I am happy for the eagles
I dont even watch football and even I can see that the chiefs o line is awful
Does mahomes not know how to change pass protection? I mean he was getting slaughtered all night
Imagine the two field goals were touchdowns
"This was probably one of the lowest rating superbowl in a while, despite a good game, but thats what happens when NFL wants to start playing these stupid woke politics. Nice job guys. We watch to see football, not your lame campaigning attempts."
Amazing content as always!
Their defense on this day reminded me of the 85 Bears. Perfect time to peak for the season.
"Obviously, the commentators wanted the chiefs to win however; Andy Reid will be back!!"
lol i know chiefs fans thought they had a 28-3 game incoming
I waited 2 weeks for that.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Now i feel bad for jason kelce
Im a cowboys fan and we still have 3 more super bowls then the sheagles
Well either way Philly is getting destroyed. Kinda don't make sense why Philly wonders why everyone hates their fans
As we say in our country SE LAS METIERON!
Thank you for the great content!
One of the worst super bowls of all time but we all knew that
What a satisfying win. The peace and quiet from the Swifties and Mahomes for the next few months is going to be beautiful
The chefs thought they were going to win the reason I wanted the Eagles to win is because all the defense has Georgia people
We may have seen the last of the Kelce-Swift duo for good and that's Ok wit Me ~
This is how it would have been for the Chiefs all season long had the refs not given then preferential treatment
Just surprised at the fact that they allowed the QB to be sacked 5 times .. or was it superior D by the Eagles ?
"Eagles defensive line was just too good! other than that nothing extraordinary. Chiefs had their chances too, no excuses! GGs to the Eagles!"
The refs was like ight chiefs we helped yall all the way until now yall on yall own today
The refs didnt let the chiefs hold for one game and look what happens.
"""Cooper DeJean is not a safteyyy"""
Brutal.....
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
DOMINATION
No refs to help da chifs this time
"Look at chiefs 65 in 1:54, he literally pushes the eagles lineman and it ended up as an incompletion"
Eagles fans shut the hell up ur team basically cheated
eagles just looked all around great in every department last night.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
I wanna shed a tear rn yo
Finally not a rigged superbowl
10:11 what run? 5 yds? Dude they hype up anything mahomes does. Stop glazing
Halftime was a joke! All that money! Cant they do better??
"As a Buffalo Bills fan, I fully endorse this Super Bowl."
"I only watched the highlights, but while doing so I was a little bit worried that the Eagle's defense would outscore the Chief's offense."
Almost as bad as 43-8. LOL.
I'm not a fan of either team. I hate the eagles fans though. So I was going to be satisfied one way or another. If the eagles lost the Philly fans crying would have been great. If the Chiefs lost Taylor Swift would cry. So since it's impossible for both teams to lose I'm satisfied seeing Swift and her woke fans get broke !!! One thing makes me proud is both quarterbacks are Texas boys !!! Like the majority of the truly great NFL players. Especially at quarterback !!!
E - A - G - L - E - S
Cooper DeJean sealed the victory when he made that pick six and returned it for a Touchdown! KC had no chance for a comeback
"I'm not an ardent sports fan, but after having grown up near Philly I only root for the Eagles. But for some deep subconscious reason unless they are 30 or 40 points ahead I can't relax watching them play. Yesterday was my kind of Eagles game. Always had the lead, didn't make dumb mistakes, didn't get dumb penalties, and ran up the score in a way I would have objected to if the Eagles were on the other end of it. It was the kind of game I would have found boring to watch if the Eagles weren't in it and winning all the way. That was the most satisfying Eagles game I have ever seen, surpassing even winning the championship game in 1960 with Van Brocklin at the helm. It's just the old-timer in me, but the only thing that would have made it even better for me personally would have been if they had been allowed to wear the retro Kelly Green uniforms."
6:45 who said white boys cant play corner??
fly eagles fly to the road to victory
Wheres the Mercy Rule?
Looked like steroids won it for them. But I'm not bitter!
"Forget eagles, they played like a pack of wild bulldogs"
NFL will beat the UFC this year for biggest miss match
Im so glad that da Eagles smoked them.
The Eagles taking a belt to the Chiefs backside was satisfying! But Taylor swift getting booed.. PRICELESS!!!
Not surprised....if you look at the wins the chiefs got .....a lot of them they just baily won.....the refs gave them a win over Bills....I think if you got back and take out all the questionable calls Chiefs got .....they might not have even made the playoffs....Mahomes played awfully against the Bills....anyone who watched the Super Bowl and are White ..stop any interest in the NFL.....and word to our Black Citizens.......if you don't want to be part of the UNITED STATES stop with the BLACK NATIONT ANTHEM......you want to get rid of Racism..stop the race card .oh and when $$$ hits the NFL and they come crawling back Don't answer the phone watch College Football
Josh sweat was lowkey the MVP 2.5 sacks 6 tackles That dline was crazy good
"If other teams ntudy what the Eagles did to Mahomes in this game, the Chiefs will never make another playoff game again. To think the Chiefs were so bad, the Eagles put in their backups."
Video has the wrong title. Should be just Philadelphia highlights.
The refs contract expired just before the game
Everyone knew KC didnt deserve to be in this superbowl and that showed in this game! Eagles was BTA all game!
"This Chief beatdown is for the Corrupt Refs giving the Chiefs so much Favor Sincerely, Texans Fan"
Lions fan here. I am so happy for the Eagles. They beat the Chiefs. Eagles showed all the NFC teams what it takes to win a Super Bowl. Great running back great receivers great offensive line great quarterback awesome defense and a pass rush with only 4 guys. Lions have a ways to go.
"I really wanted the Chiefs to lose, but I really wanted the Eagles to also lose. I'm a miserable Giants fan, what can I say?"
diff outcome on real grass
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
Remember how close the game against the Rams was? Shows how good the LA Rams currently are!
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
The last defensive line to have performed that well belonged to the 101st outside of Bastogne.
i never thought id root for the eagles
FLY EAGLES FLY !!!!!!! GO BIRDS !!!!!
Thank you for the great content!
The Bill woulda put up more of a fight than this bruh. Come on. But lets go Eagles
The. Chiefs got there A..es handed to them rock on Philly
i thought it was over for the eagles on that first PI call lol. i was preparing for the chiefs x ref duo
Congratulations to the Eagles
mahomes biggest lie in NFL
"To the Chiefs, hopefully you guys understand now that Mahomes probably isnt the goat (at least not yet). You cant deny that sometimes you need the refs. You could say the O-line sold Mahomes, but those two bad ints that Mahomes threw shows that he isnt always all that. You guys need to fix yourselves up. I dont doubt that you guys cant win another Super Bowl, but that poor performance shows that it might take some time. But good luck for the future. You guys still have a good team that can make some noise so its not over yet. To the Eagles, you guys dominated all throughout the game. Im not trying to glaze or anything, but you guys had a pretty crazy performance. This game shows the big potential you guys have. Jalen Hurts especially had a great game. That defense was especially good too, as they didnt allow a Chiefs score until the 3Q. They did allow 22 points after half which shows that maybe it declined a little. But congrats on winning your second Lombardi, and congrats to Hurts for winning SB MVP."
Amercians why are your football highlights this long when there is really not that much action? Why do I care about every first down? I get it for the hardcore fans but also have a 5 minute highlights of all the actual touchdowns
Eagles gave them da whooping of their lives
"this makes the NFC east the winningest division in the Super Bowl era with each of them having multiple Super Bowl championships. (Dallas 5, NY Giants 4, Washington 3, Philadelphia 2)"
14:13 you cant tell me Patrick Mahomes wasnt past the line of scrimmage. FLY EAGLES. Your world champs
In the second quarter Kelce was hanging out waiting for the ball from Mahomes like he was waiting on a bus.
GO BIRDS
"A little late to the party here, but as a Lion's fan, thank you Eagles."
mahomes didnt have enough to pay the refs them platinum rates like he was before
I can't put into words what an impressive and fantastic match we saw. The champion who should have won like this two years ago won!
Chiefs first TD drive they got away with 3 huge holds and Mahomes illegal forward pass to Kelce.
Thank you for saying/showing nothing about Donald OR Taylor.
"5:49-6:31. This sequence of utter dominance was a perfect microcosm of the entire game. We have been saying Thank you, Giants! all season for Barkley, and rightfully so, but we rarely say Thank you, Dolphins for letting us get Vic Fangio back. Goodness gracious, he absolutely humiliated Patrick Mahomes last night."
the eagles cooked for their home game
MI equipo los Delfines de Miami
Domination .... MIC DROP
This was a stomping. Lmfao. Dynasty over.
Eagles crushed them
11:56 watch Kelce
"Very happy for Philly, now if they would bring the half time show up to entertainingwould have been Theyve been going downhill for several years now"
13:00 hail Mary
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Cheifs will not win another superbowl..
So happy to see that the NFL and the umpires could not defeat the better team. Those umpires sure tried but still lost out Go the EAGLES!!!!
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"Who was responsible for coming up with the halftime show of total no talents, straight from the hood?"
I bet Jason Kelce is kicking himself rn
The only touchdown the Chiefs got in the first half was at the airport
"I dont know why people waste their time on the NFL. Horrible game, horrible commercials, worst halftime ever."
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
the shuttle pass to kelse looked illegal because the quarterback appeared to be past the line of scrimmage
what a boring game!
today is a good Monday.
"So..... the Egalges go to prevent defensive in the 4th Qt, KC scores 2 touchdowns!"
"Chiefs getting blown out by a real team when the refs are under the spotlight kinda confirms they are an 8 and 7 team... That said, I think the Eagle pretty much beat anyone this year."
FLY EAGLES FLY
Thank you philly For destroying this Chiefs Team
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"The world just witnessed the Eagle's version of ""Tenacious D"". Sorry Jack, I couldn't resist."
"DISGRACEFUL, the NFL didn't acknowledge the President before the coin flip. 1st sitting President to attend the SB, and he isn't acknowledged. He should have flipped the coin. Again, just disgraceful... I'm done with the NFL!"
Travis Kelce looked like he was ready to cry in the 2nd quarter...lol
Best scripted Superbowl nobody likes the cheaters thank you eagle's from a diehard 49ers fan.
beatdown love to see it
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Just shows how the Chiefs really are when the game is played fairly with no referees help.
KC Refs didnt pay enough huh?
This what happens when don't have the refs on your side
"Glad it was the Eagles, wish it were my Lions though."
"The game nobody wanted, but everyone loved."
We seen how the true Kansas City chiefs play.
This game was way better with Brady and Burkharht rather than the last one with Collinsworth and Al Michaels.
"For a superbowl game, this was boring AF (Im not a Chiefs or Eagles fan, I just wanted to see an entertaining game, a battle between two teams, not just one team dominating the whole game)"
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
I dont know if anybody notice this that shovel pass to kelce at 14:12 He was already passe the line of scrimmage by a yard or am i crazy
Cooper should of been MVP
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
It's seems chiefs back messed up seriously big time! Any repocations for him for costs the Chiefs a really serious game?
My Panthers wouldve made a better Super Bowl against the eagles lol.
My Panthers wouldve been a better opponent in the Super Bowl against the Eagles lol.
eagles wiped the floor with the chiefs sorry swiftys
Refs finally realized they had to stop glazing the Chiefs for the Super Bowl
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Steelers fans are livid
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"As much as I detest the Eagles, I can't thank them enough for doing the Lord's work and beating these menaces."
"I heard when the chiefs lose, swifty puts the strap-on and hikes Kelses balls all night long"
T Swizzle boyfriend is now T Fizzle.
Never seen so many false startsfalse starts by a snapper in one game
There's only one player with skill. The guy who throws the ball. Edit: kickers are darn good
Ive been telling people the chiefs arent good they are just lucky and the one game the refs cant help them they got destroyed
"look at the bright side chiefs fans, that new scoreboard looks kinda cool"
"Can someone please tell me why do they wear these motorcycle helmets? Are these new? I dont follow American football but I am curious. Another question, are there no more tackles (i mean heavy tackles)? This feels different from the older highlights of NFL tackles. More toned down version."
If not for 2 OT losses KC makes SB 7 straight seasons. Only offsides and blowing 21-3 lead changes that.
You can tell how bad the chiefs are without the refs
"Being a packer fan...that was so exciting...congratulations"""" EAGLES...VERY PROUD .OF YOU , TY FOR BEATING K.C...CONGRATULATIONS."
Give us Greg Olsen! Brady is worse than Collinsworth!
I can see the attraction but it's not a good game I'm afraid
We really WON !!! just like i knew we WOULD !!! Philly
"After that first controversial offensive pass interference call, i for sure thought the Chiefs were gonna win."
BTAAAAAAAAA
The chiefs were all offsides 3:13
"I'm a chiefs fan and this is sad, you know we were having a pretty alright season. We beat the bills and other hard teams so all chill and stuff. Until the most important game the chiefs have to lose it. Our O line did terrible, our recievers didn't catch except xavier worthy, even kelce dropped passes and missed blocks. Mahomes didn't even feel comfortable in the pocket and threw picks. Sacks have been happening in a row. Sad to see my fav team get destroyed by the eagles like this. But gg eagles, yall deserve it."
The Blowout On The Bayou
"Hopefully in light of the big loss, hate for Chiefs will decline in offseason. No ref call can be said to have made the difference in which team won. Chiefs need a new offensive line."
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Crazy how the chiefs score more points in the last 6 min and couldve even get a field goal in the first 3 quarters
KC run could be over. But lets see anyone else get to SB 5 times in 6 seasons.
We really WON !!! just like i knew we WOULD !!! Philly
Its hard to explain as a super bowl fan with no team but I wish the game was close
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Go Eagles!
"The Eagles have presented the rest of the NFL the blue print in how to beat the Chiefs, for now on!"
Weve been spoiled over the last two decades or so weve only had like 3 blowouts in the Super Bowl. In previous decades there were blowouts all the time
And this is what happens when the refs play fair without favoring Chiefs good job Eagles
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
It was so good that the chiefs got destroyed I watched it live and now watching it again
Thank you for the great content!
Sorry that halftime show was the worse ever! Stick with entertainers know world wide not unknowns in one small section of Rap. Not to know him but no one could relate to anyone of his songs except for Ghetto Gangs and B- Achs
"I'm not whining, but it should of been the Bills here not KC. At least the refs didn't screw this game up. Phillys D line was amazing."
Eagles better give Gillie A Super Bowl 59 Ring.
Im just here for the comments... where's my Popcorn?
Gisele Bunchen was the doomsday for Tom Brady Taylor Swift will be for Travis Kelce. Celebrities have no place in Football
10:12 10:12
"I'm not a fan, but I almost cried for the chiefs . I can't believe they lost like this. It was absolutely shocking and satisfying at the same time"
why do they were helmets and those ridicuols pants?!?!
13:12 Even the refs are making great catches
Carl from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Refs were gonna try until it didn't matter. Offensive pass interference on A.J brown was severe BS
I thought that you put the date 8:58 9:08
"My proudest moment was saying: no son, theyre saying Coooooooooper."
Super Bowl was terrible. Why because the Chiefs didnt make it a game. The Super Bowl is supposed to be the two best teams. The Chiefs sucked. They didnt bring their A game. The Chiefs coaching should have done something to get the Chiefs back on track. The win for the Eagles was never in doubt.
Nope not a good day at work I just woke him and I not today the Eagles didnt lose them wont the are is the Super Bowl championship because they are the best team American history in
Jeez. Mahomes played like a bum
"And just like that, Jalen hurts made sure there were no Taylor swift fans in sight ."
they average as hell without the refs
BILLS NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR DEFENCE BEYOND VON MILLER!!! The EAGLES HAVE THE WINNING RECIPE!!!
One of the best game I saw as an Eagles fan
Man was this satisfying to watch. Chiefs over all really weak. Nice good that their time is over.
The Chiefs dont deserve to be in the super bowl
Drake playing 'Headlines' After the Halftime show
"This video has to be fake. I watched it live, and I distinctly remember all the players on the field freezing in place every 2 seconds, then teleporting a few yards. I didn't see any of that in this video."
40 to 6.
"I was rooting for the Eagles as hard as I rooted for the Rams, Panthers, Giants, Rams again, Giants again, Seahawks, and Falcons."
Alter ist das langweilig
Can you guys make a Super Bowl micd up vid pls Im subbed
What dose that mean black ref
Someone needs to make sure that Travis Kelce gets his heart checked and an X-ray of his sternum; the end of that football hit his sternum traveling at about 60-100 miles per hour.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Andy Reid is amazing but I hate the Chiefs!!
Why did it finish early? Did the Chiefs coach 'throw the towel in'?
Tom needs to be an analyst for every chiefs game
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"This was so satisfying. EAGLES dont play!!! They murdered the chiefs! I am so satisfied. Thank you Eagles! Fly Eagles fly!!! Signed, a Bills fan"
Patrick Mahold that L
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
I added a comment on the highlights video between the Chiefs and Bills where all the bad calls happenedthe 7 year curse has started for Kansas.
We will do it again next year fly Eagles fly 2026 super bowl champs
All those chiefs fans are going to become eagle fabs now its crazy how people are
As a Seahawks fan this game felt familiar. Tho I cant put my finger on which one it was I think I need to go a mile high to find my answer
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
I bet Pat pegged Travis last night for not being there
W
Im just glad the Chiefs didn't win. Eagles are the best team of 24-25.
W
18:32 Brady clearing his throat while broadcasting was absolutely hilarious to me for some reason
The truth is that The Kansas City Chiefs had no business being in this game period. They got exposed for the inferior team they really are. Their last 3 games were handed to them by the refs. The Bills got ripped off they were supposed to be there not the Chiefs.
Omg my like made it go from 15K to 16K. Thank you to the last handful of people that didnt like the comment because their vote didnt matter.
THEY SAVED THE LEAGUE!!!
Mahomes had a stinker hes got to lose some weight because he needs to add some speed to his game when he runs out of options
This was glorious.
Amazing content as always!
"Early on, it felt like the refs were gonna be a decding factor. Those first two flags- on Brown and McDuffy- should've been picked up in my opinion, but tbh, the Eagles DOMINATED this game from start to finish, especially defensively. Mahomes had constant pressure and when he did get the ball off, he was inaccurate. I haven't seen the Chiefs get embarrassed like that, atleast in the playoffs, since Super Bowl 55 agianst the Bucs. Chiefs did a good job containing Saquon but Hurts in the first half had all day to throw. By the time the chiefs knew what hit them, they were down 24-0 at half. NO CHANCE"
"its like the Chiefs said Hey well stop the run game, but we got nothing else for ya"
No way the chiefs doing the money celebration when they got one sack down 17
I am so glad the Eagles spanked the Chiefs
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"CG Esgles! Perfect Superbowl! greetings from Czechia, Europe (Cowboys fan)"
3 sacks and no roughing the passer? Strange
the Giants allowing Barkley to walk in free agency has got to be one of the biggest free agency blunders ever made because Saquon Barkley walked out of the Giants front office and into NFL history and a SB Championship title
Who cant read a defense? Not my QB
"When are those dumb Americans going to ever broadcast real football. A handball version of ""rugger"" they keep calling football!!?! They are in their own little world!"
Sack after sack after sack let this haunt mahomes for the rest of his career
Cut go back back give me a goal like if that happens again. Tell your coach like the pistols are people in the big boys like we got to put them in OK
Audio is terrible
Such an impressive win for the Eagles. Domination in all phases. Wow!
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I WAS AT THE GAME AND GOT THIS VIDEO OF THE PICK 6!!!!! https://youtube.com/shorts/7YIiII-Q0J8?si=6aZJ1KprMgyCH9iN
"As a raider fan, this has to be one of the best Super Bowl since Super Bowl 55"
definitely watching this a good 4 times
Paparazzi crowd should not be allowed this close to athletes
Worst game Ive ever seen
Horrible game
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
thx eagles
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
Such a boring sport. Stop. Start. Stop. Start. The real football game is celebrated around the world not just one country
this was the worst most boring superbowl i ve ever seen
I like that toss to the ref after that touchdown
Bama & Georgia really showed up in this one
It wasn't even close.
Eagles won that by brut force
Happy SnowFurfee May everyone have it magical EarthRise..&.EarthSet!!!! StayFurfee
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
This was the nfl going see? We dont fix matches while theyll continue to fix matches
When refs call a game properly the Chiefs are a mediocre team. Buffalo should be here instead.
This is amazing.
Tobad Miami doesn't have a good GM
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
just saying i quit watching goverment funded sports like NFLNHL NBL back in `1980....IS ALL WAIST OF TIME AND WHO CARES !!! just a reason for drunks to buy beer and pay to watch junk ...
Stop trolling the Chiefs! They did their best all season ! They just cant win all the time. The Eagles just had no choice but to stop them!
Why did they try to lock in the the 4th while the refs had hella flags on KC
GOOOO BIRDDSSSS! They really gonna hate us now
and like Tom Grossi says in his videos: Thanks again Giants
Go Barkley and Go Birds
Rigged
Eagles D line was the MVP
Big smile on my face
1:03 had me WORRIED.
The chiefs name should be the refs
Taylor Swift will have herself another boyfriend next month. Kelce didn't do enough to offer her enough Screen time during the Superbowl.
GOOOOO BIRDS
Everyone knows that shovel pass to Kelce shouldnt have counted bc mahomes was crossing the scrimmage line but they let it slide cause they were getting clapped lmao
W
Great job by the Eagles! It was time for the Chiefs to hand over the trophy! Congratulations Eagles!
For a Denver Broncos fan that was tired of the Chiefs getting so many calls their way this was a really satisfying beatdown by the Eagles.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
NEVER GONNA WATCH NFL football again. Pure $CAM & a HU$TLE. THE blk ref only ruling against the Chiefs @ GFU
"To grow and make more popular the American football, it is time for the NFL to think about holding the Superbowl Final elsewhere than in the USA. Expand your horizon and go and see the real big world before 2030. Why not a Superbowl in Amsterdam or Tokyo or Bogota or Moscow or Saudi Arabia or Shangai or Singapore or Antananarivo or Rio de Janeiro or Toronto or Santiago Chile or Abu Dhabi ..... Good luck"
it's too bad this could have a way better game if the CHIEFS would have played as they have in other games
This One's For You America! The integrity of the sport has been saved! Enjoy it!
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
As a 49ers and lions fan thank you so much eagles the whole game was the most satisfying game Ive ever seen
Im a giants fan and Im so happy to see eagles win this especially when the giants got rid of my dude Barkley who played lights out football the whole season for the eagles
"Eagles went into this game starving, ate them Chiefs up and came out full leaving no crumbs! Congratulations Eagles!!"
And ppl think Mahomes is better then Brady yikes
"Stupid barbaric game, it's not football, it's eggball, almost everything in USA is opposite of the world even their ball"
The refs tried to give the game away
This game can be described simply. When you got beat so bad the other team cant even be mad of how it went
I like rugby better.
I'm the happiest person alive!! Thank you Philadelphia for that performance to me this was Eagles/Broncos vs Chiefs/Cowboys.....Go Broncos
THIS is what the Chiefs have been all season but the refs kept bailing them out. The Chiefs should have been a 7-10 team if the refs called games fairly.
lol 12:32 hes just draggin him by the mask
I dont understand
"18:02 50yd ""Homerun"" ball (actually in the air for +/- 65yd) Credit where credit is due ! Too little, too late. But still impressive"
who the F watches this stupid sport????
"Lifelong Bills fan, and all I can say is Thank you Philly! Fly Eagles Fly!"
draft kings won big on this one
chiefs got what they deserved
Eagles defense downright scary
Good win for the eagles. Chiefs finally got what they deserved
Up yours chiefs and swift too.. thanks eagles.
Travis kelce came to .. see the halftime show
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
18:05
I couldnt stop celebrating bro
Everyones favorite blow out
"Game ball to front 4 of eagles. I only saw 1 blitz in the highlights, yet they were in QBs face all game."
lol chiefs bad
Still find it crazy how the eagles didnt blitz on defense ONCE except for near the end of the game when it was all said and done by then.
Give mad props to Elliot! Laser focused
"Platforms like Robinhood have introduced Super Bowl event contracts through Alyssa Amy Joanne , allowing retail investors to speculate on various outcomes related to the game"
Imagine having Pacheco and Kareem hunt going against the #1 pass defense refusing to run the ball? Way to go Andy Reid smh!
Nothing new here with Mahomes he has 83 turnovers in 7 seasons and a whopping quarter dozen turnovers in the Super Bowl...
combine db
seattle lt
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"This superbowl was lmfao i didnt even feel like a superbowl. Patriots 4Life, Tom Brady GOAT!"
Jaylin put a Taylor made hurtin on them for a swift chiefs loss.
Congratulation to The great Champion Philadelphia Eagles.
"Eagles up 17-0 and Brady says that KC is a formidable defense. Yeah, i know you are new and all, maybe you dont say dumb things like that."
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Refs really had so many horrible calls early
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
13:11 DeVonta Smith's toss to the ref is perfect.
How the chiefs loser
If your team keeps making runs at the SB you are GOING to lose some of them along the way the Chiefs are NOT going to win EVERY SINGLE SB appearance that they make it is just a matter of odds and that only God is absolutely perfect all the time and no one in this Earth is. The Chiefs not ANY other team has ever not will EVER win every SB appearance that they make it too including the Eagles especially if a team is making back to back to back appearances in consecutive fashion there is GOING to be a wall that that team hits eventually to matter how unstoppable they may seem to be NO individual human nor group of humans is perfect all the time in their effort not the Chiefs and not the Eagles either.
"14:10 - 14:15 I noticed in the game, and now here (in slow-mo), Mahomes was over the line when he made his shovel pass ! I thought he should've been called for ""Forward Lateral"""
"The refs totally cheated, not letting the KC offense on the field until midway through the 4th. Unfair."
13:05 really was the dagger
Thank you for the great content!
congrats eagles
Good for the Eagles.
"Hurts just hurt Mahomes State Farm status , that boy bout to replace him"
"Kelce was missing catches on 3rd downs, letting rushers pass by in key moments. Twice in a row actually , that man was having a bad day"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Congratulations Eagles!
Eagles defense reminds me of the Steelers 70s defense. Killer!
"What happened, I thought everybody loved the chiefs? All of a sudden yall happy lol Bradys the goat"
"You could make an argument that Barkley should be the MVP, not for touchdowns or yards gained but because of what his presence on the field did to the Chief's defense. The Chief's game plan was obviously to stop Barkley from beating them, and they were successful at that. However, their focus on stopping the run opened up the passing game and also enabled Hurts to be effective as a rusher. KC had to pick their poison when it came to Philly's offense. They chose to focus on Barkley but the Eagles had enough other tools to run up the score anyway. All that said, Hurts is 100% deserving of the MVP award. Even with all the focus on Barkley he still had to have a great game for Philly to win and he delivered."
This was JPP and Shaq Barrett stepping on the Chiefs throat in the Super Bowl all over again
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
Travis Kelce couldnt stop any of the defense.
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
The game looks like for EAGLES
@14:15 over the line of scrimmage they let that slide feeling bad for him
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
First half summary. Eagles 24. Chiefs 23 (yards)
Australia here. Why they got a rag in their arse?
Eagles won back in 52 and did it again baby. Rooted for Kansis but good job eagles The D was immaculate
Game was over by halftime. Biggest blowout since Seattle-Denver.
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
We got our lick back
"Greenbay fan here, thank you Eagles, you made my whole day"
Cry Chiefs fans
THE DEFENSE!!!!!
Thats the DEFENSE that wins
kc are bums mahomes lol a bum
"My Favorite part is seeing all the Offensive Linemen & Defensive Linemen at the end of the game shaking each others hands before running to their teammates, they are such unsung heroes & most likely understand each other much more due to the constant repetition of eye contact, audibles & tackling of course."
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
who was at event stand here
Is Mahomes bad now?
I have a feeling that Patrick mahomes wont be the same after this game
Mahomes looked so defeated by the 3rd quarter. So satisfying for non chiefs fans.
i miss tyreek maaan.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Vic Fangio > Steve Spagnuolo
Jalen Hurts is a class act H Town Stand Up
Seeing the defeat on Mahomes' face makes me happy
"Wheres all the excuses? The refs, the rules, the field? Oh wait.. champions dont make excuses when they lose. They look within, take responsibility, and build. The Chiefs have had to reinvent themselves multiple times since Pat has been there. Theyve played an entire season worth of post season games. The eagles understandably just wanted it more. Happy for Hurts and Saquon but Ill refer to Bill Burr on my opinion of eagles fans"
I think Jalen Hurts is re-defining the role of the QB.
Jalen is just a Chill Guy
Eagles nailed it!!! It was a perfect game
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Fly Eagles Fly 2 Super Bowl wins since 2017 in our third appearance Go Bird's were just getting warmed up this team is so young
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"Tom Cruise mistakenly labeled the Eagles as ""Goliath"" in that strange opening video - when they're actually David."
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
The real GOAT never got blown out and could easily have 9 Superbowl's. To even make the comparison manifests a severe deficiency in cerebral capacity... PERIOD.
Thank you for the great content!
Fly eagle fly !!!!!! Support from france
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Idk why the Oline played terrible Patrick had no time to set his feet the whole game. And I think Matt Nagy is countering Andy Reid no way the playcalling was this awful. This is 100 times wost than losing to the Buccs
Best Super Bowl OAT
"Any true football experts know a good qb behind a great line will be Goated, while a great QB behind a bad O line wont do anything."
Love theEagles
I knew the eagles was gonna win because the chiefs always scraping by winning by 1 score games soo I knew it only took a good blow out to seal the game
I actually thought there was gonna be a Super Bowl shutout for the first time.
This is whats happened to the chiefs when they dont have the refs on their side
"The beauty of this was the Chiefs did such a good job of (practicing) stopping the run that they had no answer for the passing. Saquon probably affected that game more than anyone by making those 1 v 1's even possible. Not to mention his amazing, freakish blocks all game. What a stud and what a Champion."
So happy the Eagles won. Glad the Chiefs were served some humble pie in such an epic way.
this is what happens wen the chiefs dont cheat the game.
"Awful scoreboard Fox, just terrible."
I'm surprised the video is longer than two minutes long.
Turns out the top refs in the league have to play by the rules
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
DEFENSE. WINS. CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I knew the script had the Chiefs losing as soon as I saw Taylor sitting with the common folk (not in a suite). Then Travis couldnt catch a cold hmmmm. .
I had no skin in the game but I will say that Im glad the Chiefs lost. Hated that the NFL was showing Taylor Swift in last years Super Bowl. Im happy she got booed. America is tired of her old teenager look.
This is the only Super Bowl that didnt feel like a super bowl
I wanted them to give mvp to coop but hurts is just as deserving. Go birds.
"Mahomes said, ""This Hurts!!"""
"We should definitely give props to the O-Line of Eagles as well considering how many times the commentator says ""hurts got a lot of time"" before hurts throws the ball"
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
Rigged ?
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
stupid sport
America's new team. Way to go BIRDS.
"Great Game. A Classic Case of a Game Being Lost in the First Half.Well done The Eagles. Pity Kansas didn't Throw more of those Hail Mary's. ""IF You Can't go Through a Great Defense (Eagles),Throw Over Them"". Roll on 2026 Super Bowl"
Eagles defensive line was just awesome.
I'm happy Philadelphia Eagles won super bowl championship against Kansas City. I picked Philadelphia to win. This is the first time i saw Patrick Mahomes get beat by a lot of points LOL.
Fly Eagles Fly
Eagles got smash kc
Eagles def can target repeat with that defense. Shiiish
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Man those were hard fought 39 yards for kelce. Bet he wish he didnt wear that outfit.
"As a Seahawk fan, almost just as satisfying as Super Bowl 48"
America won last night.
"Lol, did you see some of those referee DEI penalty calls in the beginning of the game? You let them play in the Super bowl, how dare you call those penalties, even the announcers thought they were ridiculous"
It was nice to see the better team won the game.
Thank God for the eagles. Don't want to hear no cry babies from the chiefs. They had the refs on their side the whole season
Yeeeeeoowwwwww
What a game to witness by far the most impressive performances by the eagles
chiefs got there arse kicked
Eagles defense is dominating....it was a defensive display of domination....always different ways to change the game...
"Can anyone explain to me why, at 5.50, Kelce appears to not even try to prevent the sack? Is it some complex 'holding' rule or should there have been a second line of defence?"
13:51 its good to watch mahome boy sad
Good game wanted Chiefs to wake up sooner...and put on an aero show....
First time the NFL wasnt rigged
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
patriots came back from a big deficit to win the bowl against the falcons
This is how good Kansas City is without the referees help.
brady is the goat horrible performance by patty
Does anybody else think that the halftime show was absolutely terrible
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
The eagles got lucky with their defence...so defence does make you a champion.congrats to them
Eagles
Chiefs can't win without the refs on their side lol
Is it just me or did the Kansas City Chiefs lose the game on purpose? Anyway... Proud of the Philly eagles.
Tom brady complaint on refs stopped the favoritism. If anyone would know about getting pampered throughout his career is him
23 billion was put on the chiefs to win
Congratulations To The Philadelphia Eagles
14:08 forward pass????
Two Quarterblacks in the Super Bowl? Aren't we supposed to be unQuarterblackie?
With the Chiefs losing our long national nightmare is finally over.
Guess the chiefs ran out of money
"As a Bills fan, this was satisfying enough. I'm so glad the KC Swifties finally earned a load... our a loss... both??"
...and even Big Dom makes an appearance.
"This wasnt just a blowout, this was a slaughter!"
No ads at all
"Good game , solid football"
Best Super Bowl since KC vs BUCs
Wokism ended in NFL finally
No record for you chiefs mahomes was bad
Is this the game that played at Kendrick Lamar's concert
Too little too late. The Eagles owned the field and the day. Congratulations! Announcers sound like Chief fans.
Very satisfing
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Even if he won Mahomes wouldn't be the GOAT yet, if ever. Now that he got destroyed, he will never be the GOAT. Unless he follows this up with a 4 peat. About the same chance ofTaylor Swift not writing a song about Kelce when they break up in 6 months"
As a Chiefs fan congrats eagles on your superbowl! I had a feeling we weren't gonna 3-peat we've been going strong the past 5 years.
This is exactly what happens to you when you believe your press and you show up to win the trophy but you forget you have to play a game
Eagles Dominated the cheifsss
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"Push in the back at 6:20 was the turning point of ""thanks for rigging it for eagles guys"
"The Eagles defense was vicious last night, especially their defensive line."
"This Eagles win was pre-planned for two reasons: 1) To dispel the notion that the NFL is rigged so the Chiefs could reach the Super Bowl. 2) So Vegas can screw the countless people who placed high bets on KC, confident that they were gonna win against Philly. How many incurred heavy losses betting on the Chiefs?"
"Eagles said, and I quote. Insert batman voice: ""This isn't a fight, it's an operating table, and I'm the surgeon"" And proceeded to break both arms and legs of the Chiefs"
The eagles made that ugly scoreboard look so beautiful
Im so Proud of Jalen Hurts first and the Eagles. Not enough Credit given either. FLY EAGLES FLY!! Give the Eagles credit they deserve.! 34-0 at Halftime. Offensively they were Great. Thats what Patrick Mahomes get for walking in stadium in All green.
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"I wanted the Eagles to win this one, mainly because I never want there to be a three-peat in the NFL"
As a charger fan i would pay a.j. brown of davante smith 15 mil to play for my team.
We embarrassed the Chiefs. The Eagles came to play Philly style football. It was a massacre from start to finish. Hurts beat every blitz Spags threw at him. We had 6 sacks without blitzing. Our 4 front players destroyed KCs offensive line. Our Defensive looked like pros playing against little league players. It was the best overall team performance Ive seen. We even sat out starters at the end in a superbowl. Thats amazing. Great job Birdgang
If you slow it down to .25 speed there was no movement by the snapper on that field goal. Should have been 1st and 10 Eagles. 5:24
"finally, all better den kc haha"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Kansas City be walking the Trail of Tears.
Choke city for the Chiefs or Eagles came to Play
Oh what a beautiful day to wake up to! Life long Eagles fan I bleed green literally my Grandfather wrote the most detailed history of the Philadelphia Eagles from when the team first started to 1996 when he finished the book. This is my fourth Super Bowl and winning the championship again feels so good. Me and my dad carry my grandfathers legacy and its just such a wonderful day.
I like the Chiefs but the Bills should of been at the SB. The refs cheated for the Chiefs so this loss to me was justice.
Congrats to the chief fans in Africa for finally getting a chiefs are Superbowl champions t shirt
Kendrick Lamar had more yards in the half time show than the chiefs had the entire game
Kelce got beat on the block
Congratulations to the Philadelphia from Glarus
I aint no Eagles fan but just like 2017 against the Patriots... we were all Eagles fans.
I wonder how much Taylor lost on the game $$$$
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Fly Eagles fly hurts is a Super Bowl MVP!!!!
"This game was decided before the teams even hit the field. I respect the Eagles and don't hate that they won but they're not that great a team! KC didn't lose that game, they gave it away. Bad scripting and bad acting made fans lose a lot of money. I turned the whole thing off at the start of the third quarter ."
Chiefs Kingdom we lost but it wasnt a lost season by any means. Who repeats and makes an appearance in a 3rd? Chiefs got guys on the roster that have never lost in the postseason. Imagine that. Congratulations Philly!
trying to play tuney at tackle was a huge mistake. He got dismantled vs this line
"Brady never got blown out in a Super Bowl. This guy did. Twice, once by Brady"
Exemplary performance by the birds kc deserved every bit of it ! !
"Even the refs gave up trying to save the Chiefs like they always do. But they started off trying on the very first drive, with that ridiculous offensiver PI call against Brown!"
"Yes, they did stop the run, but the Chiefs dared Jalen to throw that ball, and look what happened. What an insane dominant game! So happy I got to share this moment with my Dad. GO BIRDS"
this is a good chief bashing forum thank
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Worst superbowl in history! What a joke. Cmon ppl let's not pretend this was an actual win. We all knew who would win but can't have a team win 3 in a row.... this is worse than letting Brady win all those games when he didn't deserve them. We all know who the real Champs are.
This is some weird-looking rugby
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
KENNY PICKETT IS A SUPER BOWL CHAMP
Im so Proud of Jalen Hurts first and the Eagles. Not enough Credit given either. FLY EAGLES FLY!! Give the Eagles credit they deserve.! 34-0 at Halftime. Offensively they were Great. Thats what Patrick Mahomes get for walking in stadium in All green.
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
You cant look like this in a SuperBowl and be in the GOAT conversation. Sorry. This counts. Its a SB. It counts big.
Patrick mahomes isnt the goat. This is evidence when the referee officiates the game fairly for both sides
"I need Williams (93) to get a raise or mvp, hero defensive moves. Eagles fly baby"
KC cheats must have shorted the refs money from what they were asking for
Wheres Priest Holmes or Christian Okoye when ya need them?
The NFL hit the trifecta here. Worst Super Bowl game. Worst commercials. Worst musical performances.
This is what Mahomes looks like when he doesnt have the refs on his payroll I think we can stop this whole goat conversation now
"Honestly, the Chiefs should be proud of stopping Saquan ao many times but they put too much energy and focus into stopping him that i think they lost focus on everything else"
cant beat a good team. cant win without refs. lol not surprised
"Joel 3 King James Version 3For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 2I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land. 3And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. 4Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;5Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 6The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. 7Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head. America and a confederate of many other nations stole and enslaved God's chosen ppl in transatlantic slavery. The Jews were black. This is part of the reason aside sin that judgement is coming. The Deuteronomy curses do not fit modern created state of Israel which should be a sign for the nations for who Israel is READ!!! Yahshua is King!!"
Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"What's crazy about this game, the refs gave the Chiefs O line a handicap cus they could tell they were boys amongst men. Holding & facemask on every play & they were like it'd be unfair to call out these kiddos for double dribble"
Only if the Niners would have gotten some of them holding calls
Im so Proud of Jalen Hurts first and the Eagles. Not enough Credit given either. FLY EAGLES FLY!! Give the Eagles credit they deserve.! 34-0 at Halftime.
"Arrtez d'appeler cette merde ""football"", le foot se joue avec les pieds et est le sport le plus populaire au monde. Vous tes dfinitivement un peuple d'incultes, heureusement le King a sauv la soire hier la mi temps."
Looks like Kansas City's gameplan of stop Barkley with everything they had just let Hurts find his wide receivers. Big mistake.
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
The Philly defense was Taylor made for a Swift Chiefs exit.
Congratulations to the Eagles and their fans!
"Im not into football at all, but watching this game has made me into an Eagles fan"
Why do these lads wear tights to play football ??
"So the Chiefs spent two weeks solely on how to stop Barkley, and nothing else."
even tho chiefs got trucked.. they are a really good tackling team.
Give me my money
chiefs play on a neutral site and get exposed.
Congratulations eagles
Some of these calls were head scratchers but shoutout to tha eagles for tha W
"Wish I could give this one 1000 likes. Dont know if anyone else caught this but before the game, Brady interviewed Mahomes and asked him what one word he would use to describe the potential third straight win. Mahomes answered greatness. Karma."
brady woulda came back
Still think the NFL is rigged I just think they knew they had to let the Eagles win this game otherwise people would have lost their mind
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"Sorry I didn't watch this live, and you guy's must have some stories to tell hope to meet you someday and talk life"
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Finally
Im so Proud of Jalen Hurts first and the Eagles. Not enough Credit given either. FLY EAGLES FLY!! Give the Eagles credit they deserve.!
i watched the game it was so good
Further proof that the KC Queefs were never the premier team of the AFC. They had ref help all season to help them get to this point just to show how they been playing all year. They are a mid team at best.
The primary runner (most carries) was Patrick Mahomes with 4 think about that.
Mahomes looking like prime dak prescott
I do not get american football...at all
Eagle taking that crown back from 2023
JUSTICE FOR THE TEXANS AND EVERY TEAM THAT GOT CHEATED BY THE CHIEFS AND REFFS!!!
Kc better replace their c with an o
that was a lousy boring football gameonly thing good was l only needed to watch the first quarter because it was over
world healed.
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
As a kc fan this was a brutal loss but going to 5 sb in 6 yrs with 3 wins I'll take that all day. Oh and let's not forget you lossed 2 yrs ago to us and then last yr JAN 15 2024 you got throttled by baker Mayfield and co 32-9. So enjoy this for a minute or so. Your boy Barkley last night was a giant in bird clothing. You won't be back anytime soon. But I'm pretty sure you'll see kc in the big game more then you want through the next 5 yrs! Obtw hurts will never win another ring.
Best domination ever
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
That was a class in domination by that defensive line!!! Way to dominate Eagles! Had the game won before end of the 1st half.
When Eagles fly
Mahomes is the most overrated athlete of all time.
E*L*G*L*E*S!
"7:20 Tom Brady said ""they haven't been able to do much today with this very formattable Chief's defense."" Mr. Goat it's 17-0, Eagles. 24-0, Eagles, Chiefs looks like they gave up"
Thank you for the great content!
Thank God the Chiefs lost!!!!Even the criminal refs could not help their Cheats!!!
congrats eagles I still love my chiefs
The coach should sack Mahomes on the second quarter...give him time
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Thank God we dont have to listen to it was the refs Non Sense.
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Defense won that game but the qb always gets the MVP...
Just watched 19 and half minutes of American football highlights and didnt understand a single thing
9:21 when you are falling down and dropping wide open completions it's just not your day.
I think that maybe the Bills would have done better.
Amazing content as always!
Go Eagles!!!
8:35 #21 what are you doing???? Your responsibility is the other top half of the field.
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Can someone tell me the difference between this game and Rugby
The chiefs were beautifully hi jacked dismantled and beaten . They didn't belong on the field
THE EAGLES DOMINATED THE QUEEFS !!!! #FLYEAGLESFLY
"Im going to register a QB sack in the superbowl as a ""super-sack"" cause nothing more satisfying than seeing Mahomes on the ground."
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Finally the taylor swift curse is over fly eagles fly
This is a shut out if Mahomes doesn't get away with an illegal forward pass.
James bradberry got his revenge .
"s/o to mahomes, he gave my boy cooper a pick six birthday gift on his birthday"
That DEJEAN interception TD
Eagles' defense is crazy
Revenge is sweet
Thank you for the great content!
Congratulations Eagles They came out ready to not just win but to defeat the Chiefs.. revenge
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
"8:16 #62 gets walked back into his QB causes a terrible INT. Go back last year and watch what Chris Jones did to Dion Dawkins in the Divisional that altered Josh Allen's throw. Not always about making the sack, sometimes just getting the QB off his mark is enough."
WHOOPED
"Sacked, Interception, Touchdown! All night long!!!!!!!"
We got robbed of a Bills-Eagles final
Life long Philly guy who loves all our teams. The Eagles have been through a lot but never gave up.
Caption wrong..Eagles Super Bowl highlights
The Chiefs are frauds
uncle vernon - justice. no meme fits better. JUSTICE
7:56 Terrible call against the Chiefs. Just god awful.
Whoops those were the email addresses that the Clinton Communists Dystopian Revolutionary Forces keep deleting for the NFL draftees for their blood bath wars.... But this..... https://youtu.be/3XriXDtfqCg?si=cDv5o4UmRfOR0Xdh
I dont get why u watch whole game for hours when plays are like 20min long and u call it interesting sport?
Amazing content as always!
"Don Sr spent over $10.5 million dollars of Bus Driver Ralph Kramden's hard earned money which was of course intended not for Ralph NOOOOO but for Ralph's lawful wedded REAL BOSS...... info@mfa.gov.ir,admin@cpc.gov.sa"
crazy how bad cheifs look when refs are fair.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
6:39 pulls a Bret Favre and throws back across his body. Cardinal sin.
This sport is so stupid
Them SEC boys Gotta ring in college and the nfl. GoDawgs
6:37 push pause and you can see he has nothing. Either throw it away or dash like hell to the sideline and get what you can.
Man if only my niners would have beat them two years ago
This exposed the cheifs for the frauds they are
Hurts playing baseball out there lol
6:35 Patrick has to see that coverage pre snap and check to a counter. Too good of a QB to not diagnose that.
"NFL is so fake, just like NBA"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Forward pass 3rd qtr before that TD
First time watching an NFL game. Seemed like the problem was that number 15 kept getting tackled. Fire him & get Tom Brady in.
14:13 illegal forward pass.
Were the Chiefs actually trying to win?
"I didnt really like either team in the SB, so I was just hoping for an interesting game. This was certainly not it"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"This sport is a joke! The Kansas No. 15 wouldn't fit in a fourth-grade rugby team anywhere in the world, in any position. Watch rugby. There is such hysteria after a tackle as if the world championship had been won."
Mahomes is having that tampa bay superbowl ngl
"6:08... first sack Kelce let him go looked like TE screen, second sack #19 just ate Kelce and Pacheco up . #62 got walked back into his QB's lap as well."
I love how they barely showed Taylor and that she was booed when they did
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
1:34 Really!!!
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"It was over by the end of third quarter. Any QB tucking the ball to run is now a RB. Hurst showed more on his runs then Mahomes clearly. The rugby style offensive line of Philly was remarkable and should've been my Bills under these same conditions a game back. Grats to Eagles this season and looking forward to my next season of my Bucs/Bills teams taking another run to this venue one game at a time. Disclaimer: If my 80's childhood Bucs team ever end up in a Super Bowl against my young adult 90's K-Gun Offense Bills Mafia, (Live Games Watched) I will abstain from picking a favorite to win it. Great game and noticed Chiefs just didn't have their game in control as much as the Eagles did."
why was it so close at the end
@12:58 Jalen Hurts throws deep to Devonta Smith in the end zone. 55 + yards & touchdown in less than seven seconds. Unreal !!! [ Eagles 34-0 ] . Game was (in all practicality) over in the 3rd quarter after this scoring run.
"19.5m of highlights, wish they would do this for every game"
I feel bad for all who betted on the chef's to win
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Chiefs: Saquon Barkley isnt beating us Rest of the Eagles: Ok..
"How about Travis stick to his principals, focus on the game and the team a week before the SB, why you taking the quarterback out with Taylor Swift to a fancy high profile dinner 36 hours before the game?"
5:06 that is a picture perfect textbook tackle. Outstanding job #20.
Mahome who??!! Oh the sac guy..
They truly never stood a chance. All of those close games vs the Raiders and Chargers told us months ago... they were never even close to this Eagles team.
well deserved
"Back to Back dominating performances, Eagles made sure the Refs couldn't win the Superbowl for the Chiefs. Congratulations"
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
The Eagles really just put in their backups for the 4th quarter
The Eagles got Mahomes on 24 hour lock down.
16:10 - 16:15 Literally looks like an Anime combo sequence to defeat the bad guy for good. You could feel the collective football world willing the Eagles to win.
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"Only once they used the foot, why its called football anyway?"
"Blowout Superbowl losses: Mahomes 2, Brady 0"
Whys that pass at 13:12 to the ref so crisps
"I said if the eagles were going to win it, they were going to have to make it too big to rig. That's exactly what they did."
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Cheifs offence is so bad lol
2:50 idk what Spagnulo saw to go with single coverage so much in this game. The Eagles beat it easily every single time. Couldn't quite see but looked like single high coverage.
"I don't recall Tom Brady ever throwing two INTs in a Super Bowl, or being sacked that many times. Love the final score."
8:26 LOL
World order restored.
This game reminded me of the Broncos and Seahawks SB defense just overwhelmed and took over the game
KFC suxs. Eagles are lucky the are not facing the real REDSKINS team. Dont care if you won I hate the Eagles forever. REDSKINS FOREVER!
Eagles only won because its rigged
"Eih Mahomes.... not fun being under such a pressure all game ah? Welcome to the day-to-day life of Joe Burrow. With a difference, Joe sacked 9 times won the game..."
Reid and KC front office are smart people... they know changes need to be made on the offensive line....
Say what you want but hurts is the definition of resilience!
The Golden Boy stank.
They should of showed gillie
"Eagles improve to 2-3 .400 now in SB, while the Swifties fall to 4-3 .571"
I never thought Id feel sorry for the chiefs and I still havent yet!
Was Mahomes having a seizure the whole game? Or did the Eagles just gave him no chance!
15:44 what a call. this for me is the lasting image of this Superbowl: Seeing Mahomes getting smacked & mugged by the Eagles D-Line.
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
40-6 is the real score. Chiefs are finished
"5:54, 6:04 and 6:11 my fav drive ever"
@14:14 how is that not an illegal forward pass? His whole body is across the LOS by the time he releases the ball!?
Idk who whines more about a loss Bills or Lions fan ....nfl had no choice but to give pouting joshy his second place ribbon ..
I'm done watching the NFL National fake league Overpaid entertainers
Gooooo Birds
Jalen hurts balled tf out!! My goodness!! But that DEFENSE??? Smh. HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE
Cant wait for the new Taylor swift song about this
"I am so glad Chiefs got dominated, Mahomes trying to act like the next Tom Brady is laughable. 15-2 during the regular and post season just to get 49 rushing yards, sacked 6 times, picked off twice, and lost possession after a fumble in the most important game the refs carried you to? Overrated."
On that third and six shovel pass from mahomes to Kelce mahomes was obviously past the line of scrimmage. Should have been a penalty bringing up 3 and 11. Chiefs would have gotten the only touchdown when our guys were still serious and we might have gotten a shut out
LORD MAHOMES HAS FALLEN
"The Chiefs didn't really show up to the Super Bowl this time, which made it a bit boring. But I'm glad the Threepeat didn't happen and that the clearly better team won. Amazing performance by the Eagles defense and pretty good performance by the Eagles offense. Question remains why the Chiefs suddenly underperformed so extremely and why they couldn't do that already in AFC final so that the Bills could have got a chance in the Super Bowl. :/"
16:15 LMAOOOOO
5:29 holy rig
6:24 DeJean happy skip 7:00 Mahomes sacked by his own guy
CHIEFS might WEAR feathers but they CAN NOT SOAR like the EAGLE.
"Is it me or are scorebugs and graphics on not only the NFL, but sports in general getting more lazier? Come on!"
"Ill admit I had no hope in the eagles, all year its been about the chiefs its been about mahomes when the eagles were up 24 all they did was talk about how mahomes and the chiefs could recover rather than the team that was dominating, I am really glad I got this one wrong congrats eagles fans"
Look at Buffalo been robbed of 3 Super Bowl performance but they give him most valuable MPV to smooth the cake over
EAGLES masterpiece incredible
Philly on behalf of the AFC delegation we thank you
The Eagles defense IS UNSTOPPABLE
Go ELGSES!!
I wonder what happened in the 4th quarter. KC outscored PHI 16-6
Jobs finished
No chietting in this game. Ref didn't chiett as hard. P. Mohomo got sack 5 times and intercepted. What a good game.
They only showed taylor swift once lol
Chiefs defense really thought Jalen Hurts couldnt throw the ball
CHEIFS OVERRATED
The eagles brought there second team into the game in the fourth to give the players some playing time I respect that coach decision fly eagles fly
LETS GO BUFFALO
Eagles avenged my Bill
"ty Kansas City Chockers, I'm sure Taylor Swift will console you."
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Go eagles!!!!!!
Eagles played to win. Chiefs idk what the hell happened to them wow
Mind boggling there is a white CB in the NFL.
He was over the line of scrimmage on that toss to kelce
"Na, ennyit r Mahomes s a KC, ha nem toljk ket a jtkvezetk..."
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
The Lions or Washington could have handled KC barbecue well done!
Eagles are Americas Team
"Philadelphia Eagles 40, Taylor Swift 0"
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"Horrible commentary by Brady. Fox should feel stupid for paying him all that money. They got ripped off, lol."
defense wins championships.
Good looking seal!
No Cahones Mahomie's got Talorized! Sooo sad KC!
"What, no blackout?"
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Lets Go Eagles!!!!!! YEAH!!!!!
Had to be fixed
An absolute massacre and I enjoyed every minute of it. That defense was something out of this world.
The refs didn't help the chiefs in this game eagles won't put up with it
I kno noone is mentioning this and it sounds silly but i really like how the fox score board looks it gives me a nostalgic 90s feel.
Good looking seal!!
The head coaches security was the mob lol
6:15 was epic... gotta love a pick 6 in the Super Bowl
"I was just hoping for a tie with lots of injuries . (that's what my dad used to say, I'm sure he didn't make it up, when you really don't like either team)."
Travis Kelce Body language says everything about how he feels..
You definitely could tell who had the eye of the tiger in that game.
"A real GOAT could be down 283 iat the end of the third quarter n the SuperBowl and still win the game. I think this goat isn't really a goat, he's more of a lamb chop....This is the second SuperBowl spanking he received, the first was ..........well to a real goat."
Not a single person with a brain cell cares
Eagles D - so many sacks. Great play by their offence as well. Chiefs may be rebuilding their offensive line for next year !
8:02 everybody's coming
Dumbest sport and the dumbest system. Hockey is the best
The first-half performance let down the Chiefs but was a deserved victory for the Eagles as they pounced on mistakes and dug deep in the second to stay ahead.
I see another repeat to next year Superbowl for the eagles
Chiefs and Mahomes lost their mojo. Lol.
Awesome game!!!!!!!!! Lets Go birds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Eagles are a classless organization, from the owner to coaches to players. After winning the game, none of them were good enough or had enough class or sportsmanship enough to mention the Chiefs. When the Chiefs beat them two years and ago and every time one team beats the other, they acknowledge the other team and gives them some credit for being there. But no, not the Eagles. These are classless and will be a one and done team."
Eagles defence world class - congratulations Eagles- Irish Steelers fan!
On that field goal attempt for false start i didnt see anyone move but KC Defense
As a neutral I was fed up of constant BS calls for the Chiefs. Finally neutral refereeing resulted in an honest game.
See what happens when there's actually a QB that's good. Not purdy. He is overrated
Good game period...
Haha I have no idea what's happening at any point
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Thats why you pay sneed
Worst super bowl in NFL history
I enjoy rugby more than american football
Which beatdown is worst???? SB48 Seahawks/Colts. SB59 Eagles/Chiefs
This makes me believe any team can beat the Chiefs again. Even though Eagles was one of the top best team in the NFL. LOL.
"what a made up sport, any other confused europeans here"
I dont even understand this game
Philadelphia Eagles SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS. LIVING THEIR VERY BEST LIFE. BIG UPS TO ALL
LFG!!!
That 4th and 2 offensive pi was a stupid call
14:13 hes clearly past the line of scrimmage.
The Jaguars put up a better fight against the Eagles this season... let that sink in for a moment.
Masterclass
"Throw, run, catch, shimmy ball"
mahomes looking like caleb williams out there
Maaaaad chiefs got chiefed
The eagles could have run up scores on the chiefs but they didn't I'm so happy the eagles won I'm a cowboys fan for the people of Philadelphia I'm on your side
NFL ... NATIONAL FIXED LEAGUE ... KNOW A 'J'0'0'? THANK A 'J'0'0'! THE FIX HAS BEEN IN SINCE THE 1920'S 'BLACK SOX'
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
How greedy is the NFL with the insane amount of ads that are on all of their Youtube videos?
TS never thought
The chiefs have highlights?
After Zach Bauns int it was over
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Stupid sport... you re just playing rugby with helmet.... coward.... this is not football
LOVE THEM EAGLES
"O-Line, finally did a good Job"
I just KNEW that superbowl logo looked too good on the Eagles jersey
Best 2025 ever! Im so glad the chiefs lost. The best play of the entire season has to be the pick 6. Hands down.
Is no one gonna talk abt that horrendous scoreboard
OUR SEASON. GO BIRDS.
"The Chiefs DID NOT deserve to be in this game. Not only were the Eagles the best team in the NFL this season, the Chiefs were probably not even in the top 10. More like a Wild Card team that should've been one-and-done. That's what happens when the refs carry a team to a super bowl.... Maybe the NFL will finally learn its lesson with this one. We'll see."
Funny how sorry the Cheats are without their zebra friend
The most boring game. How could they have such entertaining play off games and play like a rookies at the superbowl? Terrible game
The refs were not on the chief's side. They must have pissed them off.
Seeing Kelce's tears of sadness brought me tears of joy.
"Happy Birthday Saquon and Cooper, the best gifts are those you give to others, you Rock!"
Era justo ya me haban aburrido los comerciales patrocinadores de Kansas City
Barkley look so slippery when he has the ball
"So, what we learn? only come back so many times; too much scrambling; defense wins SBs; don't talk 3-peat if you're a Chiefs player (Kelce, I'm retiring after this win!), oh and, Brady is the G.O.A.T.!"
Man Hurts was dialled in
"Nice to see another winner, but unless this comes with eliminating any more mentions of any Kelce or Swift, it's empty."
7:00 Getting sacked by your own o-line is crazy
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Go Birds
How do Americans enjoy this sport its just a rip offf rugby
13:13 nice catch by the ref while making the touchdown call
"before the game I didnt really believe the league would allow the KC Swifties to lose, knowingly how badly they wanted the 3 peat to happen"
so the scripts are real
What about thooose....?
Someone call the marketing team on this scoreboard
What a stupid sport!
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Hell yeah
You can sum up this game by quoting Mr. Wonderful on SharkTank you are going to be crushed like the little cockroaches you are
"Congratulations, Eagles, on winning the Super Bowl. You guys were monstrous in the pass rush. Mahomes was not himself at all. Jalen Hurts deserved the MVP award as he led Philly to scoring drives that pounded KC's defense. Fly, Eagles, Fly!!!"
Chiefs are ridiculisous !!!
"That was very hard to watch, personally I think the Eagles should be charged with manslaughter"
"KC #15 still saying he didn't play his best. Dude --- you were STEAMROLLED, OK ? Give credit where it's DUE"
16:11 is my fav. Seeing Mahomes get rocked like a toddler.
Brady sounds so happy breaking down the DeVonta Smith TD
Referies could not support chiefs and Mahomes (y)
Finally eagle beat ks
That 3-play sequence with two sacks in a row followed by an interception has to be Mahomes' worst stretch of plays ever.
Intercept intercepted and interception sent Mahomes home
Rigoroni NFL rigoroni Super Bowl I won't be watching NFL next year after what the lions did Mahoney did Minnesota quarterback Detroit quarterback Rigoroni NFL
The Eagles used the same formula the Bucs did in super bowl 55 to defeat Mahomes.
Not enough Swifty pride at the Superbowl
Congratulations
People who think it was rigged better stop with the conspiracy theories. So stupid.
Kelce is so good agains elite D line so good in blocking almost like TE. I forgot he is TE so why he is not blocking anyone?
Fantastic game from the Eagles!!!
That O-Line of the chiefs needs A LOT of help.
Thank You Eagles for making swift work of the Chiefs.
"Me playing the theme to ""Rocky"" over and over in my head...... ""Flying high now....."""

Told my wife all week if philly was going to win they had to blow them out and keep one or 2 controversial penslties from deciding the game. Love to see it.
Why yall hate chiefs so much?
Such a great win for eagles! Fly eagles fly
Mahomes is a fraud
eagles beat magas and chiefs .. hella yea
Haha people so happy cause Chiefs didn't 3peat. Think they still happy with the 3 they got.
!
I can't remember if I have ever seen the backup players get put in during a super bowl
WHY DID IT REMIND ME OF THE SUPERBOWL LX
BEAT EM LIKE THEY STOLE SOMETHING
"So viewership is reported down 6% , wonder if its because you screwed the bills , or people are fed up with kc , or maybe because eagles are hated by many fans because of their fans.....great business plan feeding a mediocre kc team to the eagles so by halftime tvs were turning off the game worldwide ....Morons"
"""I Don't Like That One Either"" says the Whiner: 2:41"
Don't Let This Distract You From The Fact It Shouldve Been Bills vs. Eagles.
Take that Lombardi trophy home... I for one do not like the Kansas City Chiefs I can care less about the Kansas City Chiefs....
WHOPPER WHOPPER WHOPPER WHOPPER
Fly Eagles fly I'm posting this comment for my daughter to see 10 years from now HEY BABY AVA are EAGLES did it
"As a chiefs fan, congrats yall tried yall hardest and beat us."
14:15 passed the line of scrimmage. Illegal pass
KC got what they deserved. Mediocrity can only get you so far.
Eagles D-Line were the MVPs for me
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
We just witnessed the WORST Super Bowl yet
Most satisfying EVER
DESTROYYYYYYED!!!! CONGRATS To the EAGLES!!!! SUPER BOWL CHAMPS!!!
Angazi nokuthi zithi aybo ne Chiefs iboza naphesheya?
Is it just me or was mahomes passed the line of scrimmage on that 3rd and 6 play to kelce
"Eagles got to Mahomes without blitzing and their DB's reused to allow the Chief receivers to get behind them. They Eagles rushed with the intent of driving Mahomes up into pocket to get away. The score made it seem that the game was a lot closer than it really was. My only problem with the game is when the fans from the City of Brotherly Thugs booed Taylor Swift. Why? She didn't throw the ball, catch the ball, kick the ball, run with the ball, tackle anyone or even go out on the field during the game. That was low class behavior."
6:16
I would venture a guess that Cooper DeJean is the first white cornerback to get a pick-6 in a Super Bowl.
We are repeating
I cant believe the refs didnt show up for the superbowl
Great job on the game whos outcome is pre-determined so who cares about a fake football game?!
Yay
Its its all a hoax The the Kansas City Chiefs won.
If you wanted eagles to win then reply eagle goat Chiefs
Rigged
The eagles came To destroy the dynasty
"Everybody asked me and Ive been saying it for the past two weeks. If the Eagles D line can get to Mahomes, we win. We were too scary upfront."
tswift exit :) John the sweet man on the bike in the snow this is for you! go birds!
This along with the Yankgirls 5th inning choke are moments I'll rewatch forever
Do I understand this game? No. Am I gonna watch the highlights? Yes.
Where is POTUS?
Im from the UK. To translate this for soccer fans here it would be like Arsenal winning the PL or UCL.
Imagine playing a nearly undefeated season and then getting absolutely wrecked in the Super Bowl
Chiefs werent even trying trying
AJ Brown's celebration...amazing...KC bones snapping under his fists. GO BIRDSSSSSS!!!! WORLD CHAMPSSS!!!
"Y a pas dire, ce sport est vraiment nul. Ca s'arrte toutes les 2 secondes, aucune fluidit. C'est bien un ""sport"" de Ricains a."
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Too big for the NFL to rig, this time !"
"Thanx to the eagles ,,,saved us that whole Taylor swift rubbish"
Birds!
At this point change the name of this video to Eagle highlights
Chiefs was worried about saquon to much
truly a team effort fly eagles fly
Kelce looking LOST and not even attempting a block at 5:50 brings me so much joy. Old man don't got it anymore.
"Cry, Mahomes, Cry, on the road to no 3-peat (weep, weep, weep!) Weep, Mahomes, Weep, give Cooper his first pick-6 (first pick-6!) Get an INT, and one more, you should have payed refs more Cry, Mahomes, Cry, on the road to no 3-peat! COULD-NT-GET-A-3-PEAT!"
Chiefs not getting the little help this time!
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
The Eagles channeled every bit of there frustration from loosing to them last time and released it on Mahomes. I guess the Chiefs now understand what it is like to not have the Refs on your side for once haha.
"Chiefs fan here.. honestly good game to the Eagles. Chiefs gotta build on the O-line, couldnt keep Patrick safe. Good look to the MLB and next season to the NFL. #RedKingdom"
The Kansas city chiefs didn't know they where playing a game they partied to hard and wasn't able to play this game
What a SMASH
Fly Eagles Fly The MVP is the Eagles D-Line to night !!!
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
No mercy from the eagles defense
It should have been the Bills.
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
And who was the STARS of the game? Eagles Defense... they had Patrick scrambling all night long
"I cant watch the NFL. The NFL refs carried the Chiefs to the Super Bowl. Its a business, not a sport. Time for a new league. NFL is too corrupt."
Vai Corinthians !!! Go Eagles !!!
Patriots with Brady came back with 25 points of deficit.
SUPER BOWL LI NE WINS IN OT SUPER BOWL LII PHI BEAT NE SUBER BOWL LVIII KC WINS IN OT SUPER BOWL LIX PHI BEAT KC 2SB in ot PHI 2SB
14:14 mahomes was fs past the los
Go Dawgs
That throw to Devontae Smith after the turnover was just absolute DISRESPECT. I loved every bit of this!
Most boring Superbowl of all time.
Rugby league teams would beat these
A lot of us felt the Chiefs road to the Superbowl was paved with too many questionable calls and last minute luck. This game felt a bit like justice. Congrats Eagles. Your defense is terrifying.
When you dont have 87 controversial calls go in your favor.
1:37 only 1&10 in first half?
"Remember, Steve Spags beat the 2007 Patriots using a relentless D-Line. The Eagles came out and gave him a taste of his own medicine!"
Chiefs got a dose of their own medicine.
This was not a SUPERBOWL. It was an underwhelmingbowl. One team showed up with eye of the tiger.
If The Eagles have a Q.B might be scores 100piont to o
Eagles 2-0 in Super Bowl with Wentz on the bench.
This is exactly what the chiefs are when the refs don't interfere with the game. Nice job nfl but we don't trust you
The Chiefs didn't pay for their seats last night
"LAS VEGAS AND THE''''''LEAGUE-INSIDERS'''''MADE A TON OF MONEY OFF THIS GAME YESTERDAY BKZ NO ''''FIX BETS'''' ARE MADE WITHOUT ''''VEGAS-APPROVAL''''''INFLUENCE, MEANING ''''ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AND '''''GAME DECIDED''''AHEAD OF TIME YOU SEE, THE ''''CONSTANT''''BOGAS CALLS THAT ARE AGAINST OTHER TEAMS THAT PLAYED KC HAS EVERYBODY SAYING'''''YEP THE FIX IS IN, '''''''KC WILL WIN THE SUPERBOWL NO DOUBT''''''''LAS VEGAS SEES THIS AND TURNS THE TABLES AND YEP YOU KNOW THE REST........THE SAME WAY WHEN THE WARRIORS HAD CLEVELAND DOWN 3 GAMES TO 0 OR 1 I THINK AND CLEVELAND MIRACULOUSLY WINS 4 IN A ROW, EVEN THO CURRY AND THE WARRIORS HAD 1 OF THE GREATEST REGULAR SEASONS THAT YEAR!!!!! YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE WARRIORS COUDNT WIN JUST ''''''''1-GAME TO CLOSE OUT??????????"
"After watching the Texans-Chiefs game a few weeks ago it was apparent that the Texans found a way to contain Mahomes. Philly had the offense the Texans lacked. I was not surprised by the outcome. Like Presidential elections, you can only rig the close ones."
If anyone would have said to me that the Eagles were going to be up 34-6 at the end of the 3rd I would have thought they were crazy
Taylor sweet become taylor witch
1:50 I knew our defense was gonna be on one all night after this stop
shitty sport for stupid americans - total domination game
Seeing Mahomes get sacked and just beat the whole game was the best thing ever. GO BIRDS!!!
I dont abt nfl bt mahomes had no options on the pitch
@6:13 is when it was over - Congrats to the Eagles !
Fly Eagles fly! Very impressive domination of the AFC champs.
"Hurts got MVP, but Phillys D-line won this. They wrecked Mahomes all nightno time to breathe. Defense was everything"
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
very satisfying......now we need her dorky boyfriend Kelcie to retire
I wonder why they didnt show Taylor Swift as much KANSAS CITY IN MY BLUNT WHEN IM CHIEFING
"So a whole game can be fit in one, 20min highlights? lol"
That D .... Is to much for K.C...
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Mahomes deserved it.
RUNing back is hell for the Eagles...
I dont even watch this sport but 0-34 has to hurt
Mahomes still has 3 SUPERBOWL RINGS ouuuu other then Tom yall can shut up
So much for that 3peat
I haven't seen a beating that bad since Santa came to Philly
It's nice to see cheaters lose.
I see in this first Eagles drive the refs were already trying to help the Chiefs by calling that ridiculous OPI.
Defense wins Championchips
Annihilation!!
"as someone who doesn't like the chiefs, this game was the funniest thing i'd seen in awhile"
the pregame song was terrible the anthem was terrible the half time show was terrible the eagles were fantastic chiefs got scalped badly
The best part of these highlights videos is that I don't have to listen to hardly ANY Tom Brady.
"Mahomes started throwing touched downs in the last literal mites. If he had done that in the beginning of the game, the outcome wouldve been different"
"How can a guy that barked cadence in every game for 11 years go hoarse in the second quarter? Wish they had Collinsworth, Johnston, Aikman,"
"Great video NFL youtube team, thank you for not ruining this important event with adverts !"
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
You can't win with the refs all the time...
"Thank you for sharing this, I missed it live so THANK YOU"
Chiefs just showed the world how shitty they really are when the refs dont bail them out
Its almost like the Chiefs didnt belong in the Super Bowl and had been carried there by horrible reffing.
Good! Was getting tired of the same team winning it again. Congratulations to Philadelphia!
I was hoping to see Patricks brother Jackson dancing like one of the cheerleaders from the longest yard
"The chiefs defense played like everyone and the media thought they needed to do. Because everyone thought Hurts was a BUM and cant throw. ""If they can stop Barkley they win"".... must have forgot about the rest of the elite offense..."
Funny what happens when refs call a game more even. Finally making calls on the stuff the chiefs do every single game. Plus the eagles defense shut them down.
EAGLESSSSSS man I cried real tears last night
Chiefs got spanked hahahaha
Beautiful
Brady still the goat i guess
So satisfied with the eagles
That first offensive PI call at the start really faked me out. i thought it was gonna be refs vs eagles
Some really bad calls / bad ball placements. They need to have a training camp for officials.
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
"To be fair, any of the top NFC team would have blown out the fraud Chiefs. AFC was a mess all year."
This was worse than when Tom Brady destroyed Mahomes.
Amazing stuff my Devonta and aj
"5:48 was truly one of most insane 3 play defensive stand I've seen! Body blow, body blow then a knockout ! As a UK fan i adopted Philadelphia back in Super Bowl 39 when i was 13, Im now 33 and seeing Eagles win is awesome!!"
The cheifs and there fan base are worse than hamas.
No one hated my patriots like the world hates the cheifs. That says a lot. I love it. F the cheifs and there fans. Worst people on earth
"As a broncos fan thank you so much Philly! I hope all teams take some notes from Vic fangio even tho he was a terrible coach for us, because that defense was borderline relentless"
I never ever thought that Tom Brady of all people would be the one calling out the refs lmao
Great Game! And awesome result! But the half time show SUCKED not just a little.
Nfl commissioner told the chiefs organization youre on your own this one. The scrutiny is getting too close towards our scriptures
Mahomes's defense is terrible
"CHIEFS BE LIKE, OUR REFS DIDN'T SHOW UP TONIGHT."
"Many ask ""what went wrong for the Chiefs ??"" - What went wrong was KC playing with seven less players than normal, all wearing striped shirts. Officiating was under a microscope, so the calls were fair. Amazing what fair officiating and a great defense does."
That how you humble a team thats always favored and expects to win every game. Thanks Eagles!
Mahomes is soooooo overrated...and pipol are so sick of Taylor Swift
"Theyve had a good run, but it had to end eventually. Swifty fans wont be happy."
Kansas city CHUMPS !!! NFC !!
I wonder if ppl still think the NFL is scripted
That AJ Brown celebration goes hard
Im a huge eagles fan aswell but the unnecessary extreme hate on mahomes is uncalled probably just cause he gives God credit and wins alot
Look what happened when the ref dont help kanas
FLYEAGLESFLY
Where are All of my Chiefs Fans at After the Loss At Superbowl 2025 ?
Bow Bowl!
"That TD bomb to make it 34-0 was the Eagles coaching staff looking at the history of the Chiefs coming back. They decided to finally stomp them out, no comeback story today."
So how does it feel not having the ref help yall out huh? This is what real football is KC Cheaters.
Oh it felt so good!
"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
Taylor's last football game attendance
"Seeing the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the Superbowl 40-22 was nice! Unlike last year, I was surprised to see Kansas City lose Patrick Maholmes and that team lose in the Superbowl to the Eagles because I was rooting for them instead."
"This was not a fun Super Bowl to watch, but a very satisfying one."
I am a chiefs fan but the eagles out played them on offense and defense. Mahomes had no protection at all and Chiefs defense was just not there. Must learn from mistakes. Kelce was open a few times and not given the ball... I looked at both drops and they were not really catchable!
Seeing the Chiefs get blown out like this was the most satisfying thing for 95% of the NFL fanbase
boring sport bro
Mega schn
Our lord and savior Jalen Hurts
9:55 Ref almost got knocked out.
"All this talk about the three-peat, like it was just ordained. The Chiefs looked like a team that had no business being on that field last night. The Eagles absolutely embarrassed them. And for all the talk about Jalen being a glorified running back. The last three times hes faced Mahomes, hes 2-1 and outplayed Patrick all three times."
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"I have been telling people about how Mahones Chokes. Since their loss to Brady. If the refs don't help, he just gags most of the game."
America won the moment the chiefs lost
Best part of this was I could go to bed happy after the first half. :)
Sacked Againnn'!!!!!!
Eagles defense of line destroyed the Chiefs offense of line .....an this was a main factor in the Game! 7:21
Brady announcing the game is the cherry on top
Some of early calls were like wtf but eagles didn't let that get in the way.
Why did Hurts get MVP??
"Where are all the refs helped and nfl is rigged bots? Ah chiefs didnt win, you guys are so awkward"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
All of us Pats fans became Eagles fans last night Good job destroying the Chiefs! That was one of the all time greatest performances by a defensive line.
"The NFL was smart for once, everyone bet on KC winning, so they changed script to profit $$$$$$$$"
Mahomes looked tired before the game even started!The Chiefs looked flat & uninspired from the start!
Kenny Pickett was let go by the Steelers --- played in the Superbowl. Jahan Dotson was let go by the Redskins ---- played in the superbowl. Saquon Barkley was let go by the Giants ---played in the Superbowl. Way to go teams. It's too bad that Zach Erts hasn't played in one yet. I'd like to see that.
Fly eagles fly
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
I cannot believe I rooted for the bills and eagles this year lol. Coming from a pats fan
Im not a Chiefs fan or a Eagles fan but I was rooting for the Eagles
"You explained this so well, thank you!"
"Eagles fan here. Think a lot of credit has to go Vic Fangio for coming up with a game plan that shut down Mahomes & Co. for much of the game. Easily the best defensive coordinator the Eagles have had in recent history. Also, Hurts deserves a lot of credit for stepping up in a game where the Chiefs were bent on shutting down Saquon and daring Hurts to beat them. Well, he did. Will also give Mahomes some credit for trying desperately to make things happen (with both his arm and his legs) to the very end. Whatever else you want to say about the guy, he's a fighter."
"Didn't see the superbowl. But i clearly watched this, & holy s***. Patrick mahomes got hit but NO flags?mmm. Then I see that the chiefs D-line getting held but quess what? NO FLAGS. mmm. Once again a giant $$$ Corp. like the N F L catches on. They always do. Because it's all about $$$."
Well hate to say it paying the refs couldnt have happened this year like last did. The refs favored the chiefs when the Niners shouldve won lol glad my eagles won this one Barkley deserved as well as the defense
"So basically they just push each other for 10 second bursts for a game total of 15 minutes? How is this the most lucrative pastime (it's never a sport) in the world? Dejean did some running on his touchdown, good on him, that must have burned a solid 3 to 4 calories or 90% of the total game energy expended. European perspective, lover of America, but its ideosyncratic national 'sports' are a hot mess and, like its measurement system, doomed to remain a purely internal affair."
"Congrats to the Eagles SBL1X win...the 2 teams that torched Chiefs "" Bucs and Eagles...Eagles was even way worse ...ya didn't blitz at or Saquan him...ya ""Hurt"" him to death..."
"saw this last night, cannot believe 22 - 40"
"Everyone who's rooted for KC is now getting the ""rigged"" excuse mentality. They dont understand football."
4:40 thats what happens wheb taylor swift is sucking yo dk the night before the game
Lol you guys saying the cheifs was rigged to win LOL! this game was rigged so bad it was obvious even as an eagles fan myself I was kinda disappointed with a obvious 1 sided game with a predetermined victory from the beginning I kinda felt bad for the eagles even jalen hurts knew it i felt bad for him cause it was really a disservice to the eagles aswell cause even at the interview jalen hurts knew he didnt win it fair and sqaure he wasnt even that excited it wasnt genuine joy they usually have after winning a superbowl like you would after winning it cause of your own skill the eagles didn't even have to try... The chiefs deliberately played to lose they played like high-school football lol worst I've ever seen them play it was obvious they weren't even trying or even wanted to win the NFL got them to lose somehow cause they didn't want a chance of a 3 peat they said they were winning to much and couldn't be allowed to keep winning like this so yeah rip lol ohwell XD
Patrick Mahomes was running ... for his life ! 3:40
"5 sacks, 3 turn overs, terrible completion rate, could not run the ball even if they wanted to. The better team won. The eagles could have won the game with their kicking game only."
Historical game with first president too
The refs gave them that Superbowl. They're still pathetic.
"Just like I thought, Chiefs win yet again from favorable ref calls."
@11:59 Kelce just standing there lol.
"Fly, Eagles, Fly On the road to victory Fight, Fight, Fight Fight, Eagles, Fight Score a touchdown 1-2-3 1-2-3 Hit em low Hit em high And watch our Eagles fight Fly Eagles Fly On the road to victory E-A-G-L-E-S! EAGLES!!!"
No Hat trick Patrick this time!
Not an Eagles fan but I have to say.. the NFL needs to start giving MVPs to a unit. The eagles DEFENSE was the MVP of the game.
The league didn't want to tank like the NBA so for once they allowed the game to be played fair
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
Why this sport is so popular? NHL is better.
Mahomes gives such good assist to the eagles
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
Big brother smacked little brother
KC got spanked.
it wasn't even close
Thank you Philly thank you so much
"From this life long (since 1967) Chiefs fan, I'd like to congratulate the Eagles and Eagles Nation for winning SB LIX! I see no reason why they couldn't be the next team trying to 3-peat in a couple years."
"No refs help, thats what you get, EXPOSURE BABY!!!"
Refs were on Philly side all night
Scripts for the sheep
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Congratulations eagles fly eagles fly
"I think the KC got payed off , you don't go 17 @ 2 and play like they played don't make sense."
Are the eagles the next dynasty????
1:35 scumbag refs being paid to stop the birds from winning
the eagles front 4 should have received MVP
"The eagles had a 49ers fan and a Seahawks fan, together, singing fly eagles fly"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"For those who really know HOW to watch NFL games, this is a DELIBERATE way NOT TO ENTERTAIN THE PRESIDENT"
Chiefs cheated the last two superbowls and they got theirs!
"Too bad, so sad. ( Not really )"
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Good game to my Philly cousins live from Baltimore yall definitely did dat
Patrick new contract one pack of now and laters
13:11 clean pass and catch from Smith to the ref
Thank you Philedelphia Eagles maybe we will stop seeing the Travis Taylor Swift show and see real foorball.
"I was waiting for those Refs to jump in and start whipping out Flags against Philly in the last half. Thankfully, that didn't happen or else even with a 35-point lead they'll still throw the game the Chief's way. Them Refs knew they were being watched Very CAREFULLY today !"
"Such a bummer the Bills were not in this game, they wouldve made it more competitive"
I hope the eagles enjoy his moment. They only have 364 days to enjoy it.
Kansas city chief are just overrated Patrick running for his life awesome
The chiefs did well stopping Barkley
"It was just a couple of weeks prior that Nate Burleson was scolding anyone who didn't support the Chiefs. In light of that, this was the perfect game. What an absolute clown."
Its script to show yall its not scripted but it really is.
Spettacolo
"Eagles ran a train on the cheifs, worse than the train that gets run on swift."
Patrick is just a system qb
I personally think they couldnt rig this Game because they had been getting caught lately so blantinly and they had to let them play and showed how bad the Chiefs sucked this year
Luck runs out. Chiefs were average all year. Eagles dominated on both sides of the ball. Congrats Philly!
"AT 84 I'VE BEEN A LIFELONG FAN, BUT THE GAME HAS BEEN POORLY REFEREED ALL YEAR LONG. THE COMMISH SAYS THAT'S BS; WHERE HAS HE BEEN, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THE ANNOUNCERS DO A BETTER JOB THAN THE REFS. ONE HAS TO WONDER."
As an eagles fan i am proud but we rnt dont yet we are only tied in the superbowl set with the cheifs. This has to get cemented either we beat them again in regular season or the cheifs dont even sniff the conference next season.
I just read where Taylor Swift dumped Travis Kelce after the loss and is now dating Jalen Hurts!
My prediction chief will never be at the Super Bowl again congratulations Eagles. You are the superior team.
Thank god KC lost
"Thank you for leaving all the penalties and the reviews in there. Even with the refs giving them whatever they can, the Chiefs still couldnt get it done. All the Eagles had to do was score more than 30 lol"
Did the Seahawks take out starters when they destroyed the broncos in the Superbowl? The amount of disrespect . Great job Eagles
I did not watch the game because of the Kansas City Cheats. Thank God the Eagles won. Tired of seeing the Cheats given games.
I know Im not the only one.. Did Saquon mess yall parlay up last night ?
The fast that the announcers were glazing Mahomes down 34-0 is crazy work
14:02 Finally in eagles territory True but brutal
"5 times sacked and 2 times intercepted and some jerks thinks kermitt is the goat.... when refs applie the rules , kc swifties are nothing."
Congrats Engles!
thanks hank.
"The woke NFL Super Bore was a flop. The racist Black national anthem, the racist, lousy half time show with zero White people in it, the blow out of a game, made for a really Super Boring game."
How's the beginning of the greatest dynasty look??? Asking for a friend
Eagles D played out of their minds.
Is this just all of the actual play time of the game?
"@7:23 ""They haven't been able to do much against this very formidable Chiefs defense"" Philly up 17-0 Bizarre commentary from Brady."
Go Seahawks!
Eagles absolutely destroyed the Chiefs!
Yeah ngl the Chiefs Offense looked like a Highschool Team all the glory should go to that Eagles defense!!! And hey just sayin Josh Allen and the Bills would have put on a better fight to that Eagles team than those Chiefs
How was that shuffle pass. Mille for being past the line of scrimmage?
I didnt know this was a super bowl more like a blowout
Ill be watching this until next season starts.
"Not one injured player in last night's Superbowl. Not even one player shaken up--not one. Man!, that's a hard hitting game."
"as a bills fan, thank you philly for saving america"
"We could have had Bills - Lions, but instead got a lame ahh blowout. Thanks NFL."
So much for the nfl script conspiracy theory
Just another Super Boring game. As they usually are. What's with all the hype?
@5:30...an obvious infraction by the Chiefs defensive line (field goal attempt) to get the Eagles lineman to move. The refs did their best to take away points from the Eagles...
"The record for sacks in the Superbowl was Reggie White of the Green Bay Packers, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, for three sacks. that record held until this Superbowl"
"Congratulations Eagles fans, from Da Bears fan"
Dis game so fake man If u have a brain den u kno who don't take kc? I only like over
Touchdown Eagles Cooper Dejean
"Funny , Vegas odds were in favour of the Chiefs."
Thank god we stopped them
"Game was really 40-6, 40-14 at most , thats when they pulled the starters"
Philly came for a revenge and beat down!!!
"With all the heat on the ""Darling Chiefs"" for the Refs being their 12th man, the NFL had no choice but to make the Eagles win this game. Imagine the ratings plummet for next season if the Chiefs would have won this game."
I really wanted to see the Lions play Philly in the NFC Championship. That would have been a much better game. This had to be the most disappointing Super Bowl Ive seen. This was not even competitive.
"No worries chiefs fan, yall still got Taylor Swift"
One of the best super bowls in history I was so happy
Ray of hope for the NFL
4th Down and 3 #10 Field Goal It's Good
To think that majority of the defense is from the Bulldogs national champs team is insane
"My team was strong all season long!! Congratulations, thank you so much."
"Sadly i couldnt watch it live.. (im from germany and had to work early) Im not an KC Fan neither an Eagles Fan..honestly just a Fan of the Sport cuz cant really identify with any Team, since im from germany, as i mentioned. This Highlights make it seem like KC Defense wasnt playing bad but their offense where pretty much non existant other then i was reading articles like KC just generally playing bad it more likes the offense was playing rly rly poorly mainly."
The dethroning of a king can sometimes be brutal and the Eagles clearly proved it last night. Congratulations to the Birds and especially Saquon Barkley. He completely deserves a Super Bowl ring.
Eagles super bowl highlights........ the chiefs were there too...
@2:45...the pass down to the 1 yard line....check out the block by Barkley!
Fly Eagles Fly baby! GO BIRDS!
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"I remember hearing... ""The Eagles will never win a superbowl with Jalen Hurts"" Where you losers at now?"
I think the Eagles let up. If they wanted too they couldve held the chiefs to 6 points but they had dignity
I know everyone was pissed when that first PI call went in favor of chiefs defense. Errybody was like here we go again lol
I never thought I would ever be more satisfied then when the D-line smashed Mahomes 2 times then he threw a Pic 6
"thank you eagles - love, a bills fan"
Cowboys fan here!! Congratulations to Eagles!! But most importantly.. thank you for shutting up Taylor Swift and her boyfriend.
I dont know what worse the game or the halftime show
@ 6:36 Carter is literally begging while being held in front the referee
Devonta is now said how its spelled.. annoying change ur name or how ppl pronounce it
Finally! Im so glad the chiefs lost.
"I suppose Patrick can take comfort in his $500,000,000 contract poor guy"
Brady should give half his money back to Foxeveryone knows the obvious !
My condolences to all the Chiefs who spend thousands of dollars on Super Bowl Tickets and had to watch this game.
Kansas City Queefs
4.6m in 14hours and they say this is the biggest show on earth
I honestly thought that this was Josh Allen's year but with all the bad calls I'm glad to see the outcome of this one
That's enough of the GOAT talk for Mahomes. Blown out twice in the Superbowl.
Montreal Alouettes football would like Patrick rahones play so exhibitions games in Montreal so we can work on skillsets in sports
Why do they do stupid dances after every play?
This is almost as impressive as the BUCS defense from the 2020 Superbowl blowout. congrats Philly
This is the first American football game Ive watched. Arent the chiefs meant to be good?
This pass shouldnt have even counted mahomes crossed the line of scrimmage at 14:13
A route
"All the calls by the refs this year that went for the Chiefs. Caught up with them on this day. The Chiefs didn't deserve to be there, and it showed."
Eagles totally dominated those punks.
"Bardzo fajny sport, oglda si lepiej ni pik non"
PM getting sacked WAS the highlight !!
"thank you so much Eagles, you made my day last night"
"as a raider, it felt good to see mahomo humiliated. Never compare him to brady again"
I wonder how the Bills would have done.
GREATEST EAGLES GAME EVER!
"See what a good defense can do ,Buffalo."
"Brother when I saw Jaylen Hurt beginning of the season Performance and Saquon Barkley Allen Iverson move, I knew the eagles were gonna win everything."
You can see his head turn
See what happens when the Chiefs don't have the refs in their pockets!!!!!!!!
"First, congratulations to Philly on a well deserved championship!! Second, I have the formula for success in order for KC to win more Super Bowls. 1. Sell off or trade most of your playmakers. Have an almost completely new squad next season. 2. Let someone hit your quarterback in the knee, putting him out for the season. Wait for your superstar to come back hungry and win you more championships before trading him to Tampa."
This is the worst Super Bowl Ive ever seen in NFL history
First off 6 sacks numbers of turnovers mistakes by front line we may need younger blood players simply ran off the gas or were not ready for strength on strength football eagles gave rahoons will replay why they failed response football
Test the eagles for peds.
KC scored 16 points against Eagles backups. Real score was 40-6. Absolute dominance.
16:00 I thought 15 got smacked but now it looks floppy after a few rewatches Brady saying Pat trying to get one of those explosives was funny 15 is used to those roughing calls
They stopped getting away with it
13-1 if a team gets a pick 6
"This is what happens when you put women, drinking and party in new orleans instead of concentrating on the game. Mahomes and kelce .that is. Kelce hasn't been the same since he has been around swift. great job eagles for putting this team back in the place they belong"
Yessssss! Had my old school MOON jersey on
one of the stupids sport i have ever seen!!!!
Eagles took it to them dudes lol
Defense wins championships!
This game have the impression that Saquon Barkley was such an existential threat that the Chiefs did nothing except prep for Barkley. It's like they forgot the Eagles were a COMPLETE team. Mind boggling. Good thing I'm an Eagles fan
"I'm confused, can anyone relate. Too much going on"
As a Giants fan I should be anti-Eagles by default but the best team won here..Congrats!
"Can we talk about Jake Elliot?!? Homie showed up with the leg ready! After all the times he got iced, he still drilled the ball with precision."
"""#93 F- - - - N ''CLOCKED'' mahomes! ! !"
Congra eagle 2 superbowl . You guy in big boy league now
Chiefs were terrified of the Eagles defense. Zero swagger the entire game. Kelce didn't want to block. We won't even talk about the O line...
The regular season games were better than this even the highlights are boring glad I missed this game
At 14:22 we see Eagles DL #55 getting basically chokeholded as Pattycakes throws the first TD?!
"Most satisfying win I ever seen, chiefs really thought they were gonna 3 peat"
"Insane defense and that beautiful interception, loved watching this live despite forgetting just how much ad time there is hahahaha"
Chiefs it hurts
Finally
"It's not necessary, Brady, to point out the incredibly obvious. The merely obvious will do fine."
I don't feel as bad now as a Rams fan. We were beat by the SuperBowl champs. Congrats Eagles. At least my team gave them a fight. Idk what happened to the Chiefs lol
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"Congratulations to my favorite NFL team, the Philadelphia Eagles!!!!!"
Fly Eagles Fly!!!
15:56 Juh ropppp
I'm so glad I had work during this game.
"So happy eagles won!! Great job to the team and the great eagles fans, CONGRATS!"
? !
beat tf out tha chiefs
"""SMITH SHOULDA ''SPIKED'' THE BALL ON Watson's HELMET; THEN TRY TO 'SELL' IT TO THE REF THAT watson was IN THE WAY! ! !"""
This was the least I've seen Taylor Swift during a Chiefs game.
It was so satisfying watching the Cheatin Chiefs choke when it mattered. They played like . Haha Patrick Mahomes is no goat and will never surpass TB12
Yes they lost but the chiefs will be back need a offence line they didn't play well last night maybe because the orange clown picked us everything he touches dies but congrats to the eagles I am not a sor loser
Whooped dey (bleep)!
Travis kelce is so unlikeable
40-6 when Eagles rested their starters. So thats the final score for me.
"Kind of sad seeing that the refs denied the Bills from giving us a better, more evenly matched Super Bowl. But at least the eagles crushed."
That payback is a MF!...#FLY EAGLES FLY BABY!!!!!
What an interception by the coop on his birthday.
"""Nice to see that the Refs/Umps were 'IMPARTIAL' this time."""
why is this called better than real football it isnt even played with feet
Pat washed up
"I like highlights because it makes you wonder why it takes 3 & 1/2 hours to watch 1 game. Oh, how advertising has taken over our world."
"Minute 14:12 of this video , the Chiefs have 3rd and 6 , Mahome-boy was clearly over the line of scrimmage before throwing the ball , why wasn't it called ???"
"It all came crashing down for the chiefs. It is so hard to win one SB, but 3? No way!"
So this is what Americans enjoy watching than football what a lovely game
Eagles gave the whole league blueprint to beat KC.
Congrats Eagles and Hurts! Elliott was flawless
Philly Defense was the real MVP!
DyNasty Bginz
Unstrung! Ma
P'homes showed everybody how much he enjoys eating grass!
Full domination
I know so many people that could care less about watching these teams in the super bowl again and didn't watch it.
Jaylin hurts its a beast reminds me of when Brady when In there and beat them up
"did Brady just called cooper DEJEAN, this young stud."
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Wow thats crazy
Poor wittle Mrs kelce lol
My Philakansadelphia Cheagles won so I couldn't be more thrilled.
"Worthy was getting open deep all night. If the Eagles pass rush didn't show up, he and Mahomes might have connected for 6 tds."
This feels good getting back on them
It felt like justice.
Giants front office punching the air rn
I thought that it was fixed for KC to 3peat. So many people bitching that the Chiefs are gonna win the Super Bowl with the officials help. Philly absolutely smashed them. Congrats Eagles your fans are incredible and must be partying hard today.
Eagles totally dominate the overrated kc chiefs. Fly Eagles Fly to another Superbowl championship victory !!!
Amazing performance!! Lets go Birds!!!!!!!
How did KC lose without ever having holding called? Ees a puzzlement.
"Defense win championships... ...But the Eagles had both, offense and defense. Sad about blowout game. Happy for Eagles win."
The chiefs dynasty is over.
Not even the Refs could save the Chiefs from this beatdown!
That was vintage Jake Elliott last night. Go Birds!
Eagles came with a momentum and they rolled with it... jalen hurts just seemed so poised and composed the entire game and eagles defense were scary bro they were blitzin mahomes he barely had time to think and the coverage on the receivers were like white on rice... eagles deserved that win GG
"Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!"
5:26 that was rigged asf
Someone explain the final score in real football terms
Enjoyed this game last night. I was particularly happy that refrees didn't ruin the game.
Thank you Lord for giving us ALL the talents and abilities to perform for your Glory. Amen.
I could watch this over and over and over again. Go Birds!!!
Downtown was something special last night my city really won the chip like yall don't really understand fr
"coach gruden actually talked for an hour and then picked KC!!!!! lol, even i knew the eagles would win...how embarrassing for the bills fans...KC is a weak team that hypnotised their opponents with FAKE NEWS!!!!"
IS THIS THE DAGGER!?
"Two teams I absolutely cannot stand, never thought I would actually EVER find myself rooting for the Eagles over the Chiefs, yet here we are."
Obviously didnt matter but the 1st and 3rd TD passes by Mahomes were incredible throws.
"If you watch the replay on two of Pattycakes touchdown throws, there were BIG time holds not called .. Ill give em a 40 to 6 loss on paper."
"The best defense against the best offense,DEFENSE wins championships always ... dont care what yall say. Cant score cant win."
This one really Hurts - KC
Ahora no permitir que kansas llegue a la final el proximo ao
"""chief's mc duffie lookin SCRUFFY!"""
What a hiding lol
The Chiefs had their arses handed to them on a tray and the tray was bent...
That felt illegal to watch. It wasnt a beatdown it was a slaughter.
Mahomes is not the greatest this time Congrats to them Eagles. Shut KC down.
Eagle's!
THANK GOD I DID NOT WATCH IT LIVE AND JUST WATCHED THIS RECAP > AND THE HALF BREAK .I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE CLIPS THAT I SAW
So glad the Eagles won the game and what happen to the offense on the Chiefs. I did not expect to see this score happen
America won last night
If I can only read Jalen Hurts mind and every bit of the heart goes this: Gods with me Todays my day Im the best I can do it all along And Im the winner
Patricia MaFoneyHommes was manhandled by the Eagles.
How about them Chiefs.
KCC to much theater... I knew they couldn't three-peat... Team will dissolve... It will take ten years for KCC to make another Superbowl... KCC Fan.
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
the referee looks exactly like me if I were a black man. I think we may be separated at birth. He did a good job - the officials were not the focus of the game.
Didnt watch one second of this game but good job Eagles. New teams next year!!
Rear Joplin
"'THE EAGLES 'SCALPED' THE chiefs WITH THEIR TALONS! ! ! !"""
Black Quarterbacks are the future
"I have not seen the hole game yet, but based the highlights is it just me or the Chiefs look very heavy and slow"
Don't ever compare Mahomes to Brady again.
Love to see all the chiefs fans who bought 3 ring shirts must looook reaaal dumb about now.
"Even with the Ref advantage, the best team won."
Chiefs couldnt understand why the refs werent calling the plays for them .
Just happy that KC fans are crying.
"''THE EAGLES! . . . . HAVE L A N D E D ! ! !"""
Worst Super Bowl ever
"Now we can all understand what a boxer feel like when his manager tells him he has to take a dive for a fight. How in the heck Mahome's get sacked that many time.I felt as if though I was watching the movie ""The Longest Yard"", the look on Kelsey's face said it all, being a winner and having to go along with the charades. But the fine print on the NFL reads"" this is for entertainment purposes only"". In the end win and losing, it's all been scripted. Do we dare say congrats Eagles?"
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!
GOOD GAME CONGRATS EAGLES!!!
The refs tried to get the Chiefs back in it. smh
This is just a reflection of how the chiefs have played all year. The refs called a fair came and the chiefs were exposed. They shouldn't have even been there in the first place.
People say Josh Allen is reckless but looking here at Mahomes running around and just slinging it while being picked off a couple of times. Mahomes has the refs on his side for ticky tacky calls.
Why is a dollar better than the Chiefs in this Superbowl? You can get 4 equal quarters from a dollar.
The actual score : 40 - 6
The Chiefs did not show up to play. They thought it was a given that they would win. Best part is there were people who paid thousands of dollars to watch a bunch of losers.
"What a shame. Not because they lost, but because of their whole game. The fans deserved more"
"""Y Y Y Y Y Y E E E E EA A A A A A H H H H H H B A A A A A A B Y ! ! ! """
Patrick Mahomes as good as he is looked like a mediocre quarterback against the Philly defense.
worst Mahones 's game ever...
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
Maybe if KC stops making stupid commercials and start bundlerooskis good plays they will start winning without the help of officials.
Ez
Thank you Eagles. They chiefs players were crying losing the game
The chiefs got their butts kicked by a tremendous Philly defense.
Eagles dominated this Super Bowl especially that defense give credit to that defense as well.
Two sacks and a pick six in the same drive.. they delivered the dagger early tbh
"Uh, does this mean we can finally put an end to those State Farm (and others) commercials with Chiefs players/staff?"
One of the most satisfying Superbowls I've seen in a while.
i wait for 2 hours to get into the biggest bar in my city to watch this game and saw the entire first quarter on my phone outside
too many sack on final game
"On behalf of Houston, we were pleased to see Mahomes fate against the best defense in the league! Refs got him there, now he was on his own"
"Enjoy while you can, Chiefs will be back next season and win it at Levi Stadium. Chiefs hitting Free Agency OLINEMEN"
And mahomes scores to cut the lead to 30
"The Chiefs ran into a buzzsaw last night. And the Chiefs also spent the entire season barely beating their opponents by a single score. That wasn't a good formula when facing the red-hot offensive juggernaut Eagles. Also, I believe the Chiefs over-planned and over-prepared to stop Barkley, which they did, but in doing so, they forgot about the rest of the Eagles players. Eagles had everything going their way. It was their defense that won them this SB. They reminded me slightly of the 2013 Seahawks, who dominated the Broncos in SB48 with their defense. The score was near identical until the end. But going into the second half of the 3rd quarter, I knew the game was over. Mahomes picked the worst time to have his worst game ever. But the Chiefs are SB champs and will bounce back. It's going to be a fun 2025 NFL season. But most of all, congrats to the Eagles. They deserved this SB...and this is from a huge Seahawks fan."
The Denver defense would've thrown patty around like a doll!
Will we finally stop hearing all the praise for Mahomes???
7:00 love the teammate bonding
scripted
Packers fan here!! But I want to thank the eagles for beating the chiefs. Felt so good seeing them getting beat down like this. My packers put up a better fight.
"The Eagles did what the Tampa did, chase down Mahomes..."
"Nox here from Sydney, Australia. Watched this game on glass island. Party boat like kind a deal. What a game. Eagles defense were stifling. Jalen Hurts played a heck of game. Still huge respect for Mahomes and the chiefs. But this season was all about Philly"
I made my once a year bet and put $50 on the Eagles.
That defensive line was nearly unbreakable and extremely aggressive. The Eagles really stepped up the defensive. I was in shock!! Go birds!!!!!
Realistically I think the pass TD to Devonta Smith in the 3rd qtr was the back breaker
Kansas City Queefs
14:14 pat was 1000% over the line of scrm
chiefs had a ugly breakup with the refs
I wanted to see the highlight of Taylor Swift crying
GOOOO EAGLES SUPERBOWL CHAMPS
Illigal forward pass by Mahomes on that drive were they scored a TD. Of course they didnt call it.
"Good job eagles, i still think bills vs eagles is the Superbowl we all deserved to have seen but still it is what it is(im a Chiefs fan saying this)"
Direto da Neo qumica arena at consolidar campees. Vai Eagles.
"Be careful before you start throwing the word GOAT around, TB12 is the real GOAT."
"The Chiefs fans lost hope fiery early in that game, and never got it back. It was beautiful to watch. They really thought Pat was better than Tom, and that they were a new better version of the Patriots . They really thought they were going to pull a Super Bowl 51."
Anyone notice how much the announcers were saying everything for the chiefs like the chiefs with their tough defense while the score is 17-0 Or There wasnt really much there When Reid tackled Saquan after the play.
Absolutely DOMINATED them. Good luck to the rest of the nfl next year Eagles going after Myles Garrett.
Seing Saquon in the Superbowl is the only thing that is beautiful. He deserved this.
Kansas playing hot potatoes \ la patate chaude
Patrick Mahomes looked so tired the whole game. Tired as in he didnt get any sleep the night before. He had bags under his eyes etc. Must have been doing some hanky panky and not enough focus on the game.
Did anyone else notice the time still running after players would go out of bounds or penlties called. There was almost 5 minutes of gameplay lost.
Manholes touchdowns were the gift. You can see Eagles downplay to let Chiefs score
Eagles D definately won this for them. Well done guys. Well deserved win
Total Dominance! Go Eagles!
VICTORY IS FOREVER! TODAY BROTHER WE SMASH! GO BIRDS!
Rookie making a pick 6 in a Super Bowl. What a moment for that young man
Eagles 40 Chiefs 22 Final
99.9% of eagles fans do not deserve this.
Eagles monster defense
The refs won the game
"KC looks like a High School team, not even close to what I expected."
This proves mahomo is no where close to the conversation comparing him to Brady. From the little I have seen hes done nothing besides win superbowl. We need Him to break Bradys records Lets see a perfect season with a SB win We need some insane game recoveries and comebacks. This game would have been a good chance to prove. He could clutch up and come back from being down. But he didnt chiefs got blown out. Mahomo is barely in the conversation for top 10 QB of all time. Hes the goat over Brady hahahahahah get f*cked Brady haters. Youre just made he beat for teams for 20 years. Mahomo imo is the equivalent of LeBron James. Big name big star surrounded by a good team. Chokes under pressure
Fly Eagles Fly !!! Have got me hooked onto NFL in South Africa
It was 40-6 at 1 point in a Super Bowl was crazy
Mahomes chocked and its glorious
The Eagles must have drank some of that Ohio State Buckeyes juice. Fly High Eagles and go Bucks. O-H!
Mahomes throwing interceptions and getting sacked back to back was too funny
"If everyone didn't notice the refs rigging the last 2 games for the Chiefs, the Chiefs would have won"
The Eagles wanted it more !!! Ya now I can sell my official Jersey All tags still attached. Never worn.
This is what it looks like when the refs arent calling everything for you
Taylor Swift and Travis take a back seat...Mahomes was secretly playing for the Eagles. So stokeked the Chiefs got humbled.
"Every team fan but KC here, congrats on winning the Superbowl Eagles! Thank you all for starting the KC fallen kingdom! My speculation: KC is gonna win more Superbowl and if anyone says the NFL is rigged they're gonna use this major L as their defense"
Yuhhhh
title needs to be changed to Eagles highlights from their super bowl
Has anyone checked on Taylor Swift?!
"This wasnt a victory, this was a massacre Fly Eagles Fly!!"
I cant believe the hate towards KC and Im a eagles fan. Show some class. Nothing was ever rigged its called inconsistent refs
Worst game/halftime performance combo since 2020.
AMERICA. YOU ARE WELCOME. YOU MIGHT HATE US BE YOU KNOWWWWW WE ARE YOU HERO!!! ALL THE BAD GUYS TOOK THE L YESTERDAY! HARRISON BUTKER STAYED IN THE KITCHEN! DRAKE STILL MIGHT WANNA SUE! BUT THE EAGLES WON THE WAY YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO SEE. GOD BLESS AMERICA! & GOOOOO BIRRRRRRDS!!!!!
Thats what happens when the referees call a fair game the Cheats get exposed.
"Was that color commentator gargling something at the end of the game? Oh , yeah, nm."
Congratulations Eagles! What an awesome game! Defense was lights out as well as offense. Happy for Mr. Hurts and the rest of the team. I watched what happened to him at Alabama. He used that as fuel! Congrats again Eagles fans!
I went to Philadelphia it was closed.
Bro in the picture it says 2024
lol @ the scoreboard being 1 - 6 I thought they put a new way to score 1 point in the game or something
"14:07 Well, the refs tried"
BEAT DOWN
Hurts called match with that Td to smith
1:57 If only he didn't get a push. Mahomes would have more time.....
Boring sport. Give Rugby Union or league above this anytime.
Eagles smashed the Chiefs when the Chiefs clearly had the ref advantage.
Why was mahomes drilling it into the ground
"Finally, the Chiefs showing just how bad they are. Clearly can't win without the referees giving them favorable calls. Been saying it all season. Broncos exposed their weaknesses, you're welcome Philly."
FLY EAGLES FLY
"Awesome, Eagles for showing the swifts how its done. So great to see this team lose with their swift, kelce BS, there horrible annoying chant Not to mention the awful state farm commercials and the kelces all over the place. Once congrats Eagles fans"
The Chiefs finally had to play without their Angels
Tom Brady did a great job on the broadcast!
FlyEaglesFly
"Its obvious the chiefs didnt deserve to be there. The play calling was there, the offense wasnt either."
"This rivals the Seahawks defense in 13. Absolute domination. Also, no disrespect to Hurts who played great, but Josh Sweat should have won MVP."
im not so much celebrating the eagles winning as i am the chiefs losing
Hurts threw some brilliant accuracy passes.
Glad I got to watch a football game instead of reaction shots of Taylor Swift and wives in the luxury suite smiling and dancing all night.
Whoaaaaaaaaa real scripted tho
"Crazy how the Chiefs got lucky all season, has an almost perfect record and they got blown out of the water. Makes me question what happened to Spagnola and Reid."
Where did the eagles get there defense they were cooking mahomes like crazy
"The devil was defeated, thank the lord"
Doesnt matter if the refs are in your pocket if you dont score a TD until the 4th quarter
When the refs done cheat for the Chiefs it exposes them for who they really are. A middle of the road team.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
We won our 2nd Superbowl
"I love how Tom Brady is just ripping into the refs, even though he was warned about it being a minority owner."
"As an Eagles fan, I have a few things to say: I am 100% blessed to have witnessed BOTH of the Eagles Super Bowl victories in my lifetime, may those who did not get to see these victories rest in peace. Cooper is a special kid, happiest of birthdays to you, young man! Saquon is an incredible person. I wish he would have scored a touchdown, but he is the kind of unselfish player who does not care about his statline, but the victory of the team. Thank you for bringing your humility and infectious aura to the team. Jalen played incredible, congrats on winning the MVP! The defensive line is an unit to go against, and those boys deserve their flowers also, incredible performance by all of them! Same with the offensive line. I love this team, last night was the second greatest night of my life, falling short to the night I married my amazing wife. Go Birds!"
I dont watch much much football But does the KC quarterback get intercepted that much ?
1:27!!!! . Come on man!! Horrible call!
Mahomes ain't BRADY
"Yeah, yeah get out the way little NIA I got to catch this ball. Yeah yeah yeah get on with it."
"Brown, and Hopkins thought that they were going to get a free ring"
"Philly's defensive line was so quick, Mahomes didn't even have time to go into his fake slide."
"Loved the national anthem,"
Whoever designed the score graphic needs to be fired.
Pfunny how the game changes when the cheaters are identified and removed. LOL
wasnt that shovel pass on ast the line of scrimmage? Lol
"Chiefs sabotaged Super Bowl to prove NFL is NOT rigged. Fact: The AFC hasnt led Super Bowl wins since 1989. Marketing research shows theres a better market when NFC wins. Nowadays when AFC ties the following year they lose. NFC 30, AFC 29. Fact: Most games played in New Orleans are blowouts. I knew Philadelphia would win. Just wasnt sure it was going to be ref interference or sabotage. When you look at Chiefs/Swifts season, many outcomes were affected by ref interference. Where were those refs this time. Removed. This is just one of the many problems with the NFL and whether you believe theres rigging, sabotage, ref interference or whatever, the NFL openly admitted to being about entertainment and thats all it is. Its all its ever been. It doesnt matter who wins or loses, it only matters how much money the NFL makes. Thats it. Believe what you want, but Im done with the National Fraudulent League."
"Whats scary is that Hurts and this young Eagles team is basically just getting started. If they dont get complacent, they could be a problem in the NFC for years to come and begin their own dynasty."
"the chefs thought 'all we gotta do is show up ....the fix is in "" not today ,boss ! GO EAGLES !!!"
Lmao this was the greatest hate watch football game I ever witnessed
This game is a disgrace. Mahomes played like a ROOKIE. The real winner was VEGAS.
14:09 Is it just me or is that an illegal forward pass?
"EAGLES WIN THE SUPER BOWL!! WORLD CHAMPIONS!! WORLD F'N CHAMPIONS!!! This makes up for the 3-13, 5-11 Seasons. Let's get Together and Get Out On Broad, the Parkway and the Art Museum!! Please Don't Lob Full Cans of Beer.. that's a nyc, boston thing.. GREAT SEASON FELLAS!"
14:07 definitely past the line of scrimmage
"""He drops one in the bucket"". We all know the bucket is the receiver and he adjusts to the pass. That saying needs to go. The QB throws it to an area and hopes his receiver can catch it."
Halftime show and commercial were very weak
"What kind of weirdo refers to a player as a ""young stud""..."
"Yeah, yeah get out the way little NIA I got to catch this ball. Yeah yeah yeah get on with it."
"the announcer still refuses to say the KC Offense is No Match for the Swarming and unchecked Defense. The Defense was like Nuclear Jello, they were everywhere and gushed into any coverage"
que dire match a sens unique
Mahomes was seeing stars after getting sacked so many times. The second sack looked particularly jarring.
Patriots = Best Dynasty ever.
Awfull game from Mahomes.
"To all the chiefs fans, you shouldnt have even been here. 33-0? Point proven lmao"
@6:15 - Imagine being DeJean - in your rookie year you go to the Super Bowl & get a pick 6 en route to a win. Itll be hard to top that for the rest of his career.
Last year the chiefs was laughing the whole game this year eagles are the one who are laughing that wasn't a game that was a whooping
I will never support a organization that's okay with a animal abusers!! Haven't liked them since Vicks!! Disgraceful team!!
im a chiefs fan even im glad the eagles won. the officiating has been horrible for their games. its been shitty football from them bc of the officiating especially the absolute robbery that was the bills game
Kinda awkward that the americans try so hard to get people to watch the superball every year and then this happens. Most dramatic part was the halftime show and even that was awful. Maybe number 60 will finally be your year guys!
They really put Kenny Pickett in
Yessss
Im kinda new to NFL but bro that play from the eagles at 13:02 might be one of the greatest TDs Ive seen
I didn't know the Chiefs could lose in a SB Final
"This game was never as close as the final score looks, it was an Eagles Defensive/Offense/Recruiting Training film"
Thank you for the great content!
You cant start the game in the 4th Quarter. Many games this season KC didnt get started until late in the game but won. Not this time! Well done !!
"The Eagles Buzz saw allowed KC to score, only the Patriots could have come back from this deficit but not against This Team"
What a day for Mahomes haters like us I mean for the 99% of the world
Thank you EAGLES!
so happy for da eagles
Mahomes getting sacked to many times is the most KC chiefs thing ever!
"@19:03 i get the game is done at this point, but why do they just stop?"
This is how good KC is without refs holding their hand!!
*AMERICA WON LAST NIGHT*
no 3-peat
Glad I didnt have to see Taylor swift every 5 seconds
Tom Brady is a terrible color commentator.
The Eagles didn't just beat the Chiefs...they SMASHED them.
Crackle Crackle. Congrats Big Jay
I'm so happy. I can't help but hope they'll win again. From a passionate Eagles fan in Japan
7:28 Idiot #98 celebrating down 0-17 in the first half.
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"And its all over after seven years we have done it. The Eagles are finally the Super Bowl champion for second time. Congratulations. I was there watching and cheering for the Eagles. It was absolute monumental and Ill never forget and also we got the revenge from Patrick Mahomes, and the Chiefs two years ago. Hurts is the MVP! Fly Eagles fly! Well see you in 220 days for next season."
Jalen hurts did what Josh Allen couldnt and you fan girls hate it
I know Jason Kelve pissed he retired
Mahomo is who we knew he was
lets goooo
You see what happens when they dont cheat an let them play the Chiefs are low key not a eagles at all good Game Philly
"Every time Tom Brady said PATRICK, I took a shot. I am now dead. There is wifi here."
Took until the 3rd quarter to realise Kelce was playing. Funny how when Chiefs are getting hammered we don't see Taylor Swift
This feels like a Longestyard parody.
Chiefs didn't even deserve to be there. Enjoy the L
3 peat application...DENIED
1st and 2nd quarter already 34:0??? I'm like it is done lol
luckily the Eagles won... thank GOD
Being a Philly native and a lifelong Eagles fan I can officially say that The Philadelphia Eagles are the one and only Apex Predator of the NFL !! #Go Birds!
Womp womp luck gonna take another seven years
KENNY PICKETT YOU ARE A CHAMPION
im a chiefs fan even im glad the eagles won. the officiating has been horrible for their games. its been shitty football from them bc of the officiating especially the absolute robbery that was the bills game
Travis Kelce is about to be single just watch.
"This was probably the most shocking,most satisfying super bowls ever"
This is what happens when the Chiefs are badly injured at the ref position.
someone give Tom Brady a lozenge or some tea- my throat was hurting for the guy by the end
Nice!!
"I guess this is a thing the Eagles do. They lose to a team in the SB, and then years later, they go to the SB again. play that same team, same QB and head coach, and win."
The chiefs should thank the eagles for letting them score after 13. They got stomped and the know it. Eagles showed compassion.
And then some agitators decided to burn the city down in celebration
That Brady comparison talk is over
It was great to see KC get creamed! Maybe we won't see so many commercials with KC players.
That defensive coverage by Philadelphia was something else. Wow.
"handegg is so boring, haltime show has more views"
Congrats Eagles. Go Hawks!
So this was the Kansas City Cheats when they can't pay off officials....the entire team is weak
Eagles fans would have wanted Sirianni fired if he didnt win
"Lets be honest. The Chiefs didn't deserve even be in this game. They were lucky to be in this game, and the Eagles embarrassed them."
Mahonnes hadn't had a pick run back for a touchdown for years. Glad to see it happening in the big game!!
"Not much into football... I used to root for the Seahawks, and they fumbled like no other team but nope, Chiefs said, Hold muh beer bud! (In bubba J's voice please!)"
"As a person born and raised a bit South of Cleveland, I'm not a football person, but I've watched enough games while in those necessary social situations to know that this game was won by defense. They didn't let the quarterback with the tall hair do what he wanted to do in any capacity."
Eagles D line just smashed that KC O line. It was like varsity playing freshman. Yikes!!
"Chiefs defence was not bad. They kept mahomes in the game for as long as possible, but who wouldve thought mahomes gave away 14pts so quickly"
"Superbowl 2025. Chiefs 22 - Eagles 40 Final. God bless the future and life extension of the universe, America, and the NFL. God bless."
Very happy to see this misery for the Chiefs and their bandwagon.
Never understood the meaning of defense wins championshipsbut this game explains perfectly
That was a beat down on the levels of the Seahawks Vs Broncos Super-bowl. Just domination from start to finish
Tbh i think the eagles got some tips from the broncos becuase god dang they been putting mahomes on his heels
Tom Brady is not a good commentator. Why did he get this Super Bowl of all things in his first year? Just pathetic. Because a guy can play football doesnt mean he can announce or give color. He was wrong almost every single play.
The Kansas City Cheats got a taste of their own medicine
imagine paying to go to that game as a chiefs fan. LOL
Refs to the chiefs after eagles up 24-0 at half: your on your own on this one
TOOO BIG TO RIGGGGGG!!! We defeated the REFS !!!
Why they called this football??
You people who make excuses for penalties because it's a big game really chap my a**. Rules are rules. We don't stop enforcing rules because it's the Super Bowl just like we don't ignore the rules if a someone abuses a woman. That simply leads to more bad behavior. Stop being stupid.
Eagles fly Eagles fly Eagles fly Eagles fly Eagles
Eagles fly
Didnt watch this game cause Im sick of the chiefs .. great win for Philly
the best team in history
I'm so glad they lost... I feel like they had help all season
That Eagles D-line was taking souls..
DeJeans pick six was probably one of best plays of the game and a great birthday present for him.
why are black peo;le so good at nfl
"The loss of one game does not erase the greatness of Chiefs,Patrick and Coach Ried. I'm tired of media there attention grabbing narratives. Next year will be here before we know it and learning from the past is how we grow."
Eagles kicker was solid what leg straight down the middle
This shows and proves how the NFL is rigged.... KC should not have even been here and it showed.... All the fake calls would have got exposed last night to many people watching the game for them to cheat .. again KC shouldn't even made the super bowl
"I'm not a fanatic of either team, but honestly, I was not expecting a blowout"
No contest!!! Been sayen this for weeks!!!!!! Go birds
Good game
I blame Taylor Swift for the lost.
MAHOMO FANS CRYING BU BU BU
Andy Reed told the refs that AJ Brown was not allowed to contact any opposing player at any time or it's offensive PI
Jalen is the secret weapon that no body thought could do it and he gets into his rhythm and only Tom Brady could compete
Defense wins games yall
this game was closer than it looked. If about 30-40 plays went differently this game would have been close.
"Sad that the Chiefs lost, but the Eagles clearly were the better team."
"Toute mes flicitations aux eagles, mais j'suis grave du la prestation de Kansas City."
"Chiefs got molly wopped, curb stomped, boatraced, flamebroiled, and Draked."
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
KC offense got harassed by PHI all night long. KC quarterback was running for his life.
DeJean is only beginning to show what his intensity level will bring
There's a reason why no team has won three in a row. Keeping players healthy and concentrated is really hard. Congrats to Philadelphia.
"My husband and I have never watched a Super Bowl, and unfortunately didnt get to yesterday either. Not sure why we felt so strongly about the Eagles, but we were cheering and excited for them, intermittently keeping up with the scores. As Maryland residents, we are so happy for Philly."
Put to rest this silly GOAT convo people were starting to have about Mahomes and Brady lol
Last two tds by chiefs eagles had second string d line in no pressure
Why does the scorebug look like it was made in Canva?
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
The announcers were riding KCs d*** all game dude.
These announcers were sucking mahomeless off so much
The Chiefs did what they did and had to pay the consequence.
Fly Eagles fly!!!
EAGLESSSSS
Commentators still glazing their petulant little golden boy when he's losing 0-34. Lol
How can u compare mahomes with brady...hahaha brady is far far way the goat
The Cheifs had no highlights
Most dominating defensive line performance in Super Bowl history...possibly in playoff history. Amazing.
I swear the superbowl has the least excitement of any major sport. NHL they go nuts when the whistle blows. MLB the same. NBA takes a min. And nfl is just blah
That wasn't the throw of his life. The game was already over at that point.
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Live in Kansas and this is satisfying to watch. Good job Philadelphia.
"They were so focused on Barkley they missed the rest of the team. Eagles have the best defense in the league. Jalen now shares the honor with Joe Montana of being a QB to score over 30 points in a Super Bowl. KC was not ready for that 4 man rush. As normal the commentators didn't want to give the birds there props. Brady was on the struggle bus trying to find something nice to say, LOL Oh well, no one likes us and we don't care! I love my city. Go Birds!!"
Brady would have made a comeback.
No one likes that scoreboard
Im heartbroken of this game I didnt have good sleep last night
Guess tha chiefs/patriot fans gotta find a new team
Why is this video 4 hours long
Ref's really pulled out the w for the eagles
As a bears fans I'm happy
Hurts so good!!
"KC didn't deserve to be there in the first place! Roger Godell and the refs helped them get past the Bills by any means necessary in the AFC Championship game! And KC showed that it was true, with their performance in the SB!"
"Fly Eagles Fly, THANK YOU!!!!!"
Ill be watching this all spring and summer
Defense wons championships a gm said no longer ago
"You know Mahomes is dangerous because even when the eagles were up 24, I still didnt feel good about it."
"horrible entertainment, I have seen all the super bowls and this was the worst ever"
The Eagles defense is amazing. I so thrilled with outcome. Chiefs got to Super Bowl with lots of referee support this year.
"Game was rigged, Eagles: not today Satan."
Big Diddy party!
I would not call the Hurts QB a sneak because everyone knows what is coming. Like the Fridge carrying Walter Payton over the goal line-'advancing the runner' except this is advance the team
Andy Reid gets shut down by the team that made him.
Eagles cheated so bad!!!!
Most satisfying Super Bowl of my life
The Birds win the Superbowl. I blame Chip Kelly!!
Chiefs deserve it
Maybe this will fix Kelce's EGO!
La Regresa de Eagle
Notice the ref catching ball from Devonta while still in mid-touchdown-signal
"Glad to see Eagles DOMINATE the game !!! Chiefs shouldn't have even been there, but had several games Handed to them during the season. Then again the previous 2 superbowls were also Given to the Cheats Maholmes will NEVER come close to the career of the GOAT Tom Brady"
KC mounted a respectable late game rally.
"Team Was Elite all year glad yall made this one, one I wont forget til next szn"
"The NFL is very inclusive, the half time show, the before kick off show. NFL has turned into a massive joke. Gone are the days of real football, can't even onsides kick unless it's in the 4th."
Lets go Eagleas won the super bowl
Combination of Mahomes having the worst game ever and the entire Eagles team playing with total perfection.
Worst Superbowl ever in my opinion.
Can you change the title to Chiefs Super Bowl Lowlights
"Mahomes sold out, what an amateur."
I love how they did everything to stop Barkley and forgot we had other weapons
7:30 Gee BIASED announcer I'd say 17-0 they have done plenty against the Chiefs.
That ref should be fired immediately
"Dear God, Nobody has ever cheered more for one man's pain than this Super Bowl Sunday, as Kansas City wept and roars rang out across the nation with each sack."
From Egypt Fly Eagles Fly
That patrick mahomesis DOGSHIT
The lions couldve done better than that
The Eagles destroy the chief
Gioco stupido come sono stupidi gli americani
Iam sorry but this match was not clean!
14:11 does anyone else notice the illegal forward pass?
#15 0 : 34
"Mahomes' GOAT March Just got Detoured into the Swamp for a While . That Quest is over for Mahomes . Doesn't help he has been in a rigged Era for the Chiefs since 2018 . So his Accomplishments are Corrupt at Best . So he has now been Exposed Twice In a SB as over rated . As long as he can get into some Pass Happy shootout In a SB he wins them . When a team has a Big O Line that slows the game down , has a Talented Running Game , Loaded Defense with a Powerful Front 4 , and talented DBs ? He struggles . Mahomes is now minus 40 in his Two SBs Losses . Tom Brady was Minus 15 In his 3 SB Losses . Still Brady threw for 505 Yards in SB 52 setting Yards and Completion Records In a SB loss ."
Fox Sports debuts WORST 8-bit graphics in Super Bowl history LOL
"I'm glad to see the Kansas City Chumps get destroyed. Thank you, Eagles!"
EAGLES NATION ALL DAY.
"As a Houston Texans fan, thank you Eagles. Defense was on"
No three repeats for the chiefs this year
5:21 The Chiefs need that Gentleman who caught the ball. Sign him up.
Texans would beat Bills and Eagles
Brady is so bad at commentary. Geesh
Id like to take this time to wish all Chiefs fans a terrible Monday
Had my #1 shirt on all week long
Does anyone else hear Chris Griffin commentating?
"POV: An Eagle player after intercepting the football: Oops, did I did it, ahahahah 8:19"
Mahomes is average at best change my mind
15:46 Mahomes got ROCKED
This Eagles team is the most ferocious Defense and amazing Offense in the NFL with such a balanced attack and so many key weapons with a deep bench and superior coaching. The New Team that can rival the Patriots any day
How many times have you rewatched this? Yes.
Well VOICE nobody cares what you don't like......WE didn't like dozens of NO CALLS all season when there should have been.
"One rarely sees a four-man pass rush apply this level of consistent QB pressure. The Eagles dictated the Chiefs (few options) on offense. Im not a football coach, but I was very surprised that (seemingly, at least) the Chiefs coaches refused to run any formations with dual backs. I know the Chiefs strength is to spread out lots of receivers and let Mahomes work, but it was very obvious that a five-man QB protection formation had no chance vs. the Eagles non-blitz pass rush. Clearly, Reid is an excellent coach. However, not even bothering to try two-back sets, to possibly give Mahomes more protection just seems dumb or arrogant."
Best day in Philly since when they invented cheese steak?
"Thank you, Philadelphia! -A Broncos fan"
THANK YOU REFS FOR CALLING A FAIR GAME
Why everyone hates Mahomes? I'm no American and just watch the games. I don't see many interviews and I'm not active on social media. Is he really such a bad person?
I don't like Taylor Swift and she ruin the music industry! and i don't like Lady Gaga
"they used #26 as a decoy, focusing their energy on him and Jalen was the secret 'in your face all the time' weapon, I predicted 38 17"
Such a satisfying loss for the chiefs
I really just want to see nick wright eat his words i hate that guy
Chief defense was terrible . Caused them the game .
What a game Humbeling . Best super bowl in years .
The real final score was 40-6 after the Eagles let up because they felt bad. The Chiefs got skull dragged every way possible.
NFL = bread and circuses just to keep the public distracted drowning in ENTERTAINMENT A.F
Mahomes will never BEat BRADY period.
Chiefs fan here... Congratulations Eagles fans!!
Flipped over in the 2nd quarter to check the score and ended up watching the rest of the game. It was great to see Mahomes getting stymied and tossed around like that. The Eagles D really delivered and the game was exciting to watch.
People blame oline but what is this pocket presence 9:35
"From a Broncos fan, thank you Eagles and congrats!"
"Thank you, Philly. It was a great old school tuff football, Congratulations"
Philadelphia dominated every part of this Super Bowl and to add insult to injury they finished the game using second string players like it was a preseason or something . I'm proud of you Green . I'm getting tired of looking at so much red
"As an ex cowboys fan, since the 60s, I've hated Philly for decades. I never even thought about KC, but have come to despise them, even more than the eagles, in just the last few years."
Dont worry Chiefs fans yall will somehow find a way to cheat your way back into the Super Bowl again next year
yikes...imagine the fans that paid THOUSANDS for those seats lol
12:00 Travis Kelce really getting after it here
"The Eagles taking down another dynasty, oh yea!!!! Go Birds!!!"
Swift and Kelce losers...GOOD !
"The chiefs went all in to stop the run, and coughed up 40 points anyway"
From a 49ers fan. Thank you.
Wouldnt be sutprised to hear that miriam adelson bought an nfl team.
13:13 when Smith throws the ball to the ref he catches it while still having his hands up for the TD
"Is T. Kelce injured or did he literally just get washed in the last 2 games? Also, sad for the other Kelce that he wasnt the center for the Eagles today. As a Niners fan, depression is the only mood lol But congrats to the Eagles, would take your demolishing of the Chiefs any day over a three-peat."
Sinceramente no hubo ayuda del arbitraje a los jefes de transacity
This year is PROOF that Pat Mahomes can take any mediocre team to a Superbowl
"14:14 is an illegal forward pass they let Mahomes have btw, just thought I should put that out there"
14:13 Mahomes foot is way past the line of scrimmage when he makes that shovel pass. They don't call that but make all those other bad calls?
EVERYONE DOUBTED J HURTS!! HE IS THAT GUY
i know the NFL was punching the air after posting this
Only reason cheifs even scored is so Vegas could hit the over . And other parlays
5:45 fading like the low taper fade meme
Kansas City Chiefs = COOKED TRIBE!!
plymouth beating liverpool was better
My first ever football/super bowl game watching it in its entirety. Idk the rules and all that. The Eagles defence was some insane work. Always heard about Mahomes and the narrative with the Chiefs so I was expecting something great. My first impression of him made him look like I was watching Anthony Bennett with the Cavs.
Oh boy! I think Swelce is donsee.
"i just cant believe it was finally a fair game, this is how the chiefs games shoulda went all year, now they can finally stop shoving mahomes down our throats. TB12 = Goat"
"The refs did not do the chiefs any favors this year. They gave them false hope all season. This is what happens when they have to play on their own merit. Thank you, Eagle's!!! You owned them! Woot Root!!"
On behalf of America thank you Eagles
"honestly, philly is probably gonna get another SB in the next 5 years and have high season runs for the next 10 with Hurts."
A repeat of the Bucs-Chiefs SB.
Nobody wanted this SB but it was satisfying watching KC get molly whopped
"Congrats to Philadelphia Eagles! Superbowl champs after the great 1st game on Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo, Brazil"
"So all of a sudden the nfl aint scripted ? And players actually play ? What ? What a crazy concept, everyone here celebrating that the chiefs lost but if they won all Id see is nah this game is rigged. Chiefs are a great team but the Eagles just wanted it more, theres always next year"
KC and Andy Reed didn't wake up til late in the 3rd
This was BTAAAAA
This was definitely a fair game both sides got called out having the correct refs. Now I we all got to see what Kansas City looks like in a fair game. This was a game that mahomes and Kelce will never forget.
KC CHEATERS
Great game either way !
"I have genuinely never seen refs so clearly biased towards one team throughout an entire season. Eagles knew if it wasnt a blowout, they probably lose, just like the last super bowl when these two teams met."
"Good riddance to the Kelces, too! Congrats Eagles, you CRUSHED them good!!"
"Hey Chiefs, you want some fries with that 40 burger?"
My Ravens didn't make it to the main stage. But I am happy the Cheifs lost. Fly Eagles Fly! Great job the way defense played! They are the MVP of the game!!!
"Yeah, thisbis what happens when you use the refs to get a bunch of frauds into the superbowl"
Kelce fell down like a scared little girl after every catch! He never tried to run farther! Bench him!
I enjoyed watching the chiefs get spanked
"NFL was smart to have the Chiefs lose this one. Dont be fooled, it was still rigged. They knew the only way to make this Super Bowl have positive ratings was for the Chiefs to lose"
So whats the news with rice and his dui
"Someone needs to make an edit on the Eagles defense and Chiefs offensive line. It's a prime example of how ""the trenches"" wins the game. If either one of those elements is weak, it's game over before the second half."
6:20 sack.sack..pick 6
Where tf were these holding calls in both super bowls against the niners F the chiefs
I think REF. here is a MINOOOOR
It was funny how 34 to nothing and the commentators was still celebrating that shovel pass to Kelce.
"I'm not a fan of either team, but I am super happy for Philly! Great showing by the Champs. I'm so glad KC lost."
Chiefs trying to make flopping thing.
Thanks you Eagles. My hate against the Chiefs in this season ist so huge. This was the best revange in the last years in the NFL. So much love from Germany and enjoy your win.
Technically the Chiefs only scored 1 td. The others ones the Eagles allowed.
How the chiefs really play. But also eagles defence carried
And the Eagles complete what the 49ers could not lofl
You know there's at least one idiot gm who didn't draft DeJean because he's white. Lol
"The jerk-0ff Hollywood side-show is OVER. GO HOME, YOU LOSE."
Full grown men on the Chiefs sidelines crying like 8 year olds! Great role models! Mahomes lost on purpose! Vegas bets?
Useless Kelce
"6:32 As an European watching this, this made me cringe like the US is not the whole world. Ik its off-topic but still. The delusion is crazy EDIT: Very happy the Eagles won even tho i like the Giants better"
If Mahomes had Allstate instead of state farm he'd be protected from mayhem like this...
Idk what is worse this or Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul
He threw that ball to cooper degene on purpose
chiefs hater for life thank god they lost.
"This is what happens when you have a great Defense game , and and does anybody else think the chefs offense line kinda gave Patrick the one off he pissed his line off cuz they didn't have no empathy for him"
"As an added bonus the EAGLES are in the same division as the cowgirls, hey little jerry thats how its done"
Glad the eagles STUCK it real hard to KC.
"Eagle fan here since 1968. During my Navy days, (1980-1989) My dad would tape the games in New Jersey and mail them to me in Japan, Australia and the Philippines. Constantly watching 2 weeks behind. But never missed one! Took a lot of smack talk from 49er and Redskins fans. This game brought a lifetime of Eagle craziness full circle. ABSOLUTELY DOMINATING. Thank you to my PHILADELPHIA EAGLES!"
Why is this video 12 hours long? go birds
"You guys cant notice that hes throwing these interceptions on purpose, that first pick 6 should be obvious. What window did he have to say I can make this throw? You cant see that these games are fake?"
"Eagles fan for life, phew"
im do not know whatto say
"Thank you, Eagles. No more suffering through those idiotic chefs-reid-mahomo-keldo-swifto commercials."
6 sacks with 0 blitz packages. Has that ever happened before?
As a Brit nfl always looked like a good sport to watch but for most brits there are too many ads apart from that looks a class sport
What a load of rubbish
HOW ABOUT THAT THREE PEAT
",, ! "" "" ' -...."
This was a WONDERFUL performance on both sides of the field from the Eagles! I am so proud of them!!!
Has anyone mentioned that FOXs new score bug looks horrible
"When a four-man rush sacks the best scrambling QB in the league, you might want to take a look at your O-line. The Eagle's defense deserved MVP!"
You don't get to complain about the refs when they have been in your pocket the past two or three years
I live for this moment
"KC OL couldnt deal with PHI front 7, KC front 7 couldnt do anything against PHI OL"
The Eagles were able to sit their starters.. IN A SUPERBOWL
Good to see the cheating queefs with no refs help
Hate to say it..but that game looked like mahomes owed alot of money to someone!!....wink
"Due to Mahomes ENDING INjury, and knowing he will NEVER be % again, Allen will rISE. That era of what was a temporary KC dynasty is OVER."
The nfl should do away with the taking a knee to end the game
"2/10/2025. FootBall? No, FeetBall. 22 men equals Feet."
"Thank you Philadelphia, congratulations!!! The nation is so sick of the Chefs and Taylor Swift!!!"
"Nasty plays by KC. Punching, Kicking, Biting, FaceMasking, Spitting. Stay classy Kansas Fried Chickens!"
So glad Barkley got a ring!!!!
"""THEY"" GAVE IT TO BIRDS, SO THAT IT IS NO LONGER SUSPICIOUS FOR GIVING SO MUCH TO KC"
12:32 FACEMASK HOLDING
Mahomes is worse than Matt Ryan
See!
Congratulations to Kellen Moore for his outstanding contribution and the entire Eagles Defense for this huge win. Domination on both sides of the ball by Philly. Jalen Hurts MVP. WOW !
Chiefs exposed
Gooooo... EAGLES!
it's already over when it started
"What a joke, that wasn't even a kick."
"Taylor wants Mahomes gone, That Kelce been crying all night, can she request for that??"
I liked Bradys perspective as a Color guy
Chiefs. fans are so
Oh my... Kenny Picket got a Super Bowl Ring.. Congrats~!!
The Eagles made Mahomes look like a mere civilian!!!!!!
"As a colts fan, thank you Philly"
Yo... Notice the ref decisions... Not who the chiefs needed to ref the game...
Ahhh its nice seeing every team the chiefs annihilated all come together in their lil fan club to cheer against them best Super Bowl in years
Overrated Mahomes loses
The refs check bounced
13:08
I wish Kobe Bryant could have seen the Eagles win....
Saddest movie I ever watched...
Looks like the chiefs were all hung over and flat footed!
Kansas City can go eat a piece of humble pie!
WHERE ARE ALL THE DOUBTERS??? JALEN HURTS IS THE MAN
"Whats the word, DESTROYED."
Whole world is haters
Defense Always Wins Championships
Chiefs' true colors showed they did not deserve to be there. They stunk up the joint!
One of the worst super bowls and commercials and halftime. What a waste of time super bowls getting lame lame every year
Where all the Chiefs highlights?
Go Eagles!
"It's just my opinion, but I found the Eagles amazing last night, and the Chiefs absolutely not up to their talent level. however i m so happy becase i m fan of bills and eagles in same time"
"God I was so drunk I don't remember any of this lol congrats Eagles! I guess. Just happy no ""3peat"" Keep it Riley. Then turn it sideways..."
My city did that! Its like Philly always gets into the superbowl when America is sick of the teams winning. In 2018 ppl were sick of the patriots and we beat them and now ppl were sick of the chiefs and we slaughtered them! & lets be honest they probably would have stayed at 6 points in the end of fourth quarter had we kept all our star players in but we took them out cause we had the game so those little points they got in the last of 4th quarter we gave to them PHILLY WE WON THE SUPERBOWWWLL this parade is about it be up!!
We told yall we was coming and yall aint believe us!!
13:07 best play ever!
Not gonna lie thowas praying for a complete scoreless blowout
"They got lucky so many times this year, the Chiefs shouldn't have even been in this game. They were wildly mediocre this year and they sure played like it in the Superbowl and I love every second of the Eagles D beating up Patty Cakes."
The refs did ALL they could to help KC win. What a joke!
My eagles are champs
What a domination
I'm a so happy I could a cry !
Kansas city sleep for 55 minuts wtffkk
Brady never laid down like that in a SB..
"Hurts so good Come on baby, make it Hurts so good Sometimes love don't feel like it should You make it Hurts so good"
I'm sure there were lot of people including myself were happy that we didn't had to see taylor swift on camera during the superbowl much this time lol
"14:07 This play was a gift from the refs. Mahomes ends up clearly past the blue line when making the flip pass. This is an illegal forward pass, past the line of scrimmage. Loss of down and five-yard penalty, making it 4th and 11 from the Philadelphia 48. No one can say what would would then happen on 4th down, but there would have been defensive line pressure once again. If the Eagles stopped KC on 4th and 11, they would have taken over near midfield still up 34-0 entering the fourth quarter."
As a Steeler fan I was rooting for are fellow PA team but this honestly was the most impressive defensive showing against mahomes I ever saw he literally had to work for every yard they got!!! this defense was SMOTHERING!!!
This jus shows the chiefs are really a 7-9 team they got bailed nearly every game
"Everything was even, until it started."
Vic Fangio realized if you pressure Mahomes in the pocket he (for whatever reason) steps back into the pockets and becomes susceptible to a sack.
Chiefs O-Line took the entire game off.
Chiefs did everything to stop Saquon and forgot about the rest of the team
The Chiefs have had that coming to them for a while.
Its very crazy to see the chiefs being thwarted by the Eagles. It amazes me what plan the Eagles had came up with and wow Jalen Hurts really knew how to hurt the chiefs scripted acts (we all know the chiefs games are scripted just for Taylors and Kelces fame) No script here tonight
Most exciting part of the game was the halftime show lol
GO EAGLES
congrats philly
Inconsistent is Mahomes in this game......eagles defense didn't give him breathing room to make moves and pass
That game was so fixed get outta here thats the reason why I do not watch sports anymore
"The chiefs were definitely off their game yesterday bad coaching, bad play calls,bad quarterbacking, dropping passes and bad defense! this means youre going to lose! Worst Super Bowl Ive seen in 50 years"
I cant lie the chiefs did shut down saquan
America was made great again last night. Now waiting for the Resurrection
"Mahomes' career is over. Maybe not his football career, but his TV career is over. Say goodbye to those T-mobile commercials. To be a football star, you have to be, uh, good at football."
Fly Eagles Fly!
"Congrats to the eagles, they earned this one fair and square, even though the loss was painful, Im still proud to be a chief, cheers to next season where the NFL will hopefully be normal again"
"MVP of this game clearly should've gone to Rick Lovato, the Eagles long snapper"
Score does not tell this story. This was a murderous performance.
"As a broncos fan, I'm now an eagles fan"
I enjoyed 15 getting sacked and sacked and sacked
"Congratulations to Philadelphia Eagles SuperBowl LIX Champion it was a completely domination, Ive never seen KC got beaten so bad like this in Mahomes,Kelce and coach Reids in their entire career in NFL, it was shocking ."
See what happens when the refs do what they are supposed to do and be fair!!
15:47 DECKED! LoL
It was frustrating just hearing patrick mahomes name over and over no matter how bad he played they never once though to talk about how good the eagles defense was
Pretty lame in the end. Why werent chiefs defending properly first half? They didnt look like they wanted it. Looked like Mike Tyson tryna earn a pay check
I just love that Nick Wright is going to have a terrible week.
Taylor Swift lost again
This game was hard
The worst halftime show ever!
I loved everything about this game. Jalen Hurts beat the odds and proved the nay sayers wrong!!! #Hurts1 #Smith6 #Bamabreed
"As a Seahawk living in Missouri, thank you Eagles"
Even the refs on KC payroll couldnt save the Chiefs.
The EAGLES deserved it! 100% The defense played vicious. Ill just say that.
Super Bowl 50 was still better then this
KC defence looks like down in number
"What was going on in the minds of KC coaching? With under 5 minutes to play, and down 5 or 6 possessions, why the hell not let some bench players into the game?"
Hurts is him
This is what the Kansas Sh!*ty chefs play like without the refs backing them up.
FLYE EAGLES FLY!!!!!
It hurts to see that spanking.
We just do what we do
They just showed an 80 yr old Jeffrey Laurie with his daughter.....ohh..mmm wait it's his wife!!!! She looks 27!!!!! Sicko!!! Where's Colorado ped patrol wen u need them ...of course I'm kidding ...she's way above age and I hope Mr Lurie lived another 59 years!!!! Just hope his team falls apart...I'm just a jealous loser Cowboys fan....BUT when the Eagles win 3 out of 4 and have 5 Lombardi ' s we can talk.
3 rushing attempts for Kareem Hunt smh
"Look at the Kansas City Cheats when they no longer have the refs on their side. They're mortal now Thank you Jalen Hurts. Thank you Eagles. Without the refs protecting them, next season will be open season on the Chiefs all across the NFL, and it will be immaculate"
"I'm honestly shocked that this happened. I figured the Chiefs deficiencies would catch up with them, but not like this. Every issue reared its ugly head: penalties, poor past protection, calling too many runs, etc. This was just like the Tampa SB loss only 5 times worse. I'm delighted as a Patriots fan but also shocked. I thought this game would be close."
Congrats Eagles you deserved
Pat mahomo forgot the pay check for the reffs
2023: Chiefs beat Eagles 2025: Eagles beat Chiefs
"Rip.... Patrick mahomes and the dumb goat talk...dude was 4 Superbowls down to Brady and they were saying when he wins this game....they already placed him in front of Joe Montana who has 4 bowl victories and zero losses. And in the era that the QB took huge punishment. Goat Brady, Montana, then Bradshaw, Aikman and Mahomes... Mahomes will never get 7"
absolute complete team. Best philly team ever?
"Congratulations, Eagles, for bringing that Lombardi back to the NFC where it belongs. From a loyal, proud Chicago Bears fan."
"This was the best Super Bowl I ever watched, so happy and relieved as a Eagles fan. Defense is up there with the Bears, Ravens and Seahawks."
Can we talk about how Elliot had himself a NIGHT. Fans were crying for him to be released but he stepped up BIGTIM
This proves how much impact the refs had in getting the chiefs to the Super Bowl. Without their refs its a blowout
FKC eeerrr KFC or something like that
Imagine playing backup QB and reserves in a Superbowl. Pure domination
"Reluctantly as a Redskins fan i have to say , Eagles well done you fully deserved it."
Greatest defensive performance in Super Bowl history. It was a beauty to watch
I love how Hurts was just so in tune to the blitz. They blitz and he would just run it up the middle for big gains.
Pulled for the Eagles as if they were my Ravens. I love birds. FLY EAGLES FLY
I watched the Superbowl and I rooted for the eagles but I never thought my team would whoop the chiefs that. Bad
I saw mahomes in pre game interview with Brady and the arrogance was so thick coming off him. This loss was deserved. And you can tell him I said that. Ask him how long did he think he was gonna get handed games by the nfl for the sake of a good story?
The Earth healed itself.
"It is funny cause you can see some real shitty penalties against the Eagles even in the highlights, but the refs had no way to dig their boys out of this absolute annihilation."
"We did it again, 2 time Superbowl champs"
I told my friend that the Eagles would win bc the betting odds are too sweet for the Chiefs. Everyone was betting on the Chiefs like it was easy money and got scooped
"I genuinely dont understand the hate from football fans on Mahomes. The guy is one of the best QBs we have seen recently, besides Brady, hes involved in zero drama, helps the community, is a great team player, and yet everyone wishes upon his downfall for simply winning in the game of football?"
You guys think soccer is boring because of low scores. Well at least soccer players don't stand around or lie on the ground 95% of the time.
Its like somone told the dline that cheifs o line fkd their wife or sum played so fast and angry
Brady needs a hobby that he is actually good at.
Go Birds....Way to Go....As a Steelers fan happy for you guys....Also let's just be real Chief fans the score does not depict the beat down....Only thing the Chiefs won last night was the COIN TOSS.....HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
There are a lot of people that have a Brady jersey and mahomes jersey in their closet. If you know you know
This was horrible. The chiefs will be back
"Chiefs and eagles both good for 21 the wholeg game, but the difference is the legs of the quarter backs for each team. Hurts won that MVP. Eagles will always have good defense"
"Hurts is not a good QB, he was carries by the Eagle Defense"
Production: Act of producing; a staged event.
DESTROYED THEM
"I see every almost every highlight, however where is the play where Kendrick destroyed drake?"
Yes Brady was saying wen he beat Patrick in 2020?? He said Patrick had the same kind of line. They obviously need to draft offensive lineman. Can anybody explain to me why the Giants gave the Eagles Saquon????
Mahomes legs were shakey after that 1st sack. Eagles studied how the Buccaneers dominated the Chiefs & it worked fantastically
Eagles reminiscent of 85 Bears
"Attention! In Russia, the illegal use of a person as a tool for exerting a destructive influence on the international community of democratic states in order to destabilize them is being carried out."""
"Boring game, I just went back to playing battlefield 2042"
Are we not gonna talk about how ugly that score board is
Mahomes? Mahomes who? The one lefties were saying is better than Brady?
MVP HURTS !!
Jalen Hurts is my pick for offensive MVP. Josh Sweat is my pick for defensive MVP. Jake Elliott is my pick for special teams MVP.
What a spanking
SUPER BOWL CHAMPS
Cooper dejean is not a safety hes just a corner who will lockdown your number one dejean is cb1
2nd round Qb is superbowl MVP
I think I am the only person who read a 21-0 first half perdick here in DENVER. Some are happy with chiefs throwing the season game for the wild card. But go EAGLES knew it would be chiefs down fall...
Send those homie mclongie home lol. Not as good as they thoug. Lol
"All the bad calls brought KC, ruined the SB, KC was completely outmatched. never should've been the 1 seed and never should've made it this far"
The Chiefs should not have even been in the super bowl. They did not deserve to be in the super bowl and it showed the way they were dominated last night!
"Worse play calling I seen by Andy Reed team in Long time , that and an amazing job by eagle defense , with a lot of help from the refs added up to a hard game to watch for all chiefs fans congrats bird's"
Pretty crazy what happens when the refs bring you to the Super Bowl
See how good the chiefs ACTUALLY are when the refs let the other team play
HOW ABOUT THAT 3 PEAT
15:38 tb he never gon get a cheesesteak again
of all the awful Super Bowls I've watched this was the worst...with the only redeeming characteristic that the Eagles destroyed the hapless and refereed-driven Chiefs.
"Hey KC, there was a football game yesterday, did you forget?"
W Eagles
Do you guys have any idea how ridiculous this 'sport' looks for people outside the US?
This was an A Team versus a Z Team. One worked on action and the other depended on the Zebra ride.
"I wasn't mad at the Chiefs for losing, or the Eagles for winning. I'm just disgusted at the stupid comments in chat. If you hate the Chiefs for winning so much, then you aren't true Sports Fans. I don't think even the Patriots got this much hate. Fear not, the Chiefs will return to play again. After all, it is just a game."
Can you finally stop showing Taylor Swift??? It is about football not about her!! We dont see the other players wives on tv is it?? STOP IT!!!
Cooper Dejean first white cornerback with a pick six in the Super Bowl. It was also his Bday!
The Orange Julius jinxed the KC ( of KANSAS - Dumb Dumb's words ) Chiefs by declaring they would win the SB.
Maholmes will now be known as SAC LUNCH MAHOLMES!
Kansas ha sbagliato qualsiasi cosa mentre Philadelphia le ha azzeccate tutte. Per un tifoso neutrale non stato un grande match ma complimenti agli Eagles. Successo meritato!
Both Mahomes And Hurts are high school quarterbacks in Texas
Eagles Defense was just outstanding sheesh Congrats Fly Eagles Fly!!!!!
Fly Eagles Fly
This was Super Bowl 55 all over again for Mahomes
One of the most satisfying choke jobs by Mahomes Ive seen. The football world thanks you for the great entertainment.
GO BIRDSSSS
kelce's finished and so apparently is swifty
At least this will shut the swifties up
"Well it finally happened, chiefs too caught up in their own hype, the commercials, girlfriends, holly wood or whatever, I have seen 12 year olds with more desire to win than the chiefs. It was obvious from the first snap how this was gona play out. Congrats Eagles, even though I am not a fan, the chiefs deserve everything you dished out!"
this was the weirdest super bowl I've ever experienced
"YASS FINALLY OMGG SEEING THE EAGLES FINALLY BEATING THE CHIEFS IN THE PLAYOFFS OF THE SUPER BOWL THIS TIME HAD ME DYING WHILE WATCHING THE WHOLE GAME AND JUST WARMS MY HEART BECAUSE NOT ONLY THAT THE CHIEFS FINALLY GOT THEIR BEHIND WHOOPED THIS TIME, THIS LOST IS FOR BILLS, BENGALS, RAVENS, RAIDERS, CHARGERS, AND BRONCOS, AND THEIR FANS AS WELL LOL, THANK YOU EAGLES FOR SAVING US FROM THE CHIEFS CULT TEAM AND I'M A PACKERS FAN LMAO FLY EAGLES FLY Y'ALL DID IT FOR US ALL ."
WTF Hands to the face
Saquon was suppose to be Super Bowl MVP but the chiefs spent to much time worrying about him when Eagles had all their receivers hot last night.
"Ils devraient regarder des vidos de rugby, ils gagneraient beaucoup en performance utiliser systmatiquement le rafut, plaquer au jambes, le tuchdown sur l'interception dbut de match, il y a 2 joueurs en couverture, au rugby, jamais il ne passe et en plus au foot amricains, ils ont des gants qui accrochent. Franchement, il y a trs peu de combat physique, il n'utilisent pas tout leurs potentiels, j'ai l'impression de voir des cadets au rugby, qui n'osent pas se toucher, se faire mal... Amenez des prparateurs de rugby, des gestes techniques du rugby dans vos clubs, vous allez halluciner du changement ! Le premier qui comprend a, il gagne le championnat !"
"It was nice to see smith and brown get TDs, and for cooper and baun to get picks! Everybody was on their A game frfr"
Its much more satisfying watching this knowing the result
My throat still hurts from yelling with excitement at this game. What a game!
So this is American football ? Just pushing people out of play ? This was everything I saw all game doesnt make any sense ball back and throw on the front and take the player with the ball out of play
Hurts & Barkley 2028
"Wow, what amazing passes!"
Watching Kelce get blown up on blocking in the first half was amazing.
"was my first time watching the super bowl. (i live in scotland) said to myself., ""whoever wins the super bowl, i'll start following until i can make a super decision on who to support""."
This Super Bowl gave me Super Bowl 48 vibes lol both this game and that game was shined by defense.
It was obvious who was gonna win. Eagles beat their previous opponent 55-23. Chiefs barely beat the bills with a field goal. But also proves that mahomes was helped the whole season
Great performance by the Eagles!
a lot easier to watch this game without 30 mins of talking and commercials between each of the plays
Was this a 1980's SuperBowl? Sure felt like one.
"Whoever download the game thank you so much, keep up the good and hard work."
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, pick 6 Cooper! BUT ALSO HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Saquon Barkley! THE MAIN REASON WERE CELEBRATING, outside of our defense! And Jalen Hurts! Zero sense for Brady & Kevin to omit that multiple times when they wouldve emphasized it if Barkley won MVP to cap his historic season"
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
"who is here, ( EAGLES FANS ONLY ) who rewatched this game to see the masterclass we exhibited to the world. Like this comment."
This is what movies is made of
When AJ hit that LeBron celebration I was ready to jump through the wall
Never watched a Super Bowl were one team didnt show up for 3 quarters.
"CHIEFS: ""We're going to three-peat. We're going to three-peat."" EAGLES: ""We're going to squish you like an insect and flick you off our windshield."" NFL: ""We're going to give you the worst, most immature half-time show."" TOM BRADY: ""I'm going to my eleventh Super Bowl."""
"7:19 they havent been able to do much this game against this very formidable, tough chiefs defense brother, it is 0-17, Eagles. who is paying you to say such worthless drivel. they really let anyone get in the announcing booth these days."
nani
Anybody else think Tom Brady sounds like Chris Griffin from Family Guy?
"As a Chiefs fan, excellent job Eagles! Congrats and lets do it again next season!!"
15:40 This is a perfect example of what NFL fans have been hoping would happen for years. Chiefs got the Chiefs treatment
The short push over the line by the Eagles could be countered by the tackles going to ground. Stop the impetus forward. They'll figure it out like they worked out how to stop the refrigerator - or big running backs - in the 80's.
Hopefully the afc learned something from this game lol
This is truly beautiful... I am a happy man on this monday morning
This is what the Chiefs really look like when the Refs aren't on the pay roll. Lol
This was America vs Chiefs fans.
I'm so happy to hear the Kansas City Cheats lost in the Super Bowl
Brady never would have gone down like that. Just sayin'.
@13:18 I was like aight Im going to bed. Congrats Philly.
No 3 peat
That was Awesome!!! Half time show ....awwww NO
"I'm so proud it should be against the law.Birds fly high, especially whe they are Egales"
The eagles defense oline and receiver talent and the qb amazing they even gave barkley some chill time and they still know wassup
"Go Eagles,We knew Kansas City was not what they say"
Chiefs should have never been in the Super Bowl. The refs carried them this far and see how bad they collapsed when the refs couldnt carry them any farther.
"As a Boise State fan, Im so pumped for Kellen Moore. Im also happy for Vic Fangio. Just complete domination all around. Thank you, Philly!"
Jalen was throwing dimes all night ! He looked super relaxed in the pocket
Cheifs got exposed.. When flags don't fly they get molly- wopped
Even the refs couldnt help this this game lol they did try early
It was 34-0 lmao they dismantled them
Saquon had a great birthday. Congrats Eagles!
"Mahones: ayo ref wheres the script, why we doin so bad, yall not helping man!!!.. Refs: sorry kid, aint no scripts during the big game, they dont pay us enough for it.so good luck out there."
Smitty catching that dagger pass was crazy!
This Superbowl reminds me of how Ohio State Buckeyes destroyed Oregon Ducks in the rematch. Philadelphia Eagles have avenged their lost 2 years ago in the Superbowl.
NFC East all day!
Congratulations Eagles for the Super Bowl championship!
weird when you don't have reffs helping you
Gooooooooo eagles
Fly eagles fly
Not even the Refs could bail the chiefs out
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
"The nation is healing. The Dems are out of offices, DEI is getting abolished, the economy is changing, America is finally begging to belong to AMERICANS again, AND the chiefs lost."
never compare mahomo to brady ever again
It was to beautiful to watch lol
Chiefs be playing like they got drunk on Bourbon Street the night before.
Boring game KC reign is over and Phil giving there history one and done
Phk Philly! Dallas will always be America's team!
Fly eagles fly
I will say the same thing that I said when Brady won the MVP for the Super Bowl against the Rams ...... someone on that defense should have won it.
"Ive never seen a more dominate defense in a SB, more dominant than the Seahawks v Broncos SB. The Eagles smoked them on all three levels and all positions. VERY impressive!"
"D-LINE & DEFENSE FOR MVP! The D-line didnt blitz ONCE until late in the 4th. HISTORIC DOMINATION. KC CHEATS got blitzed! Without getting blitzed! F Taylor Slow! F Trailer Swift! And her ZERO-CATCH FIRST HALF, ONLY 4-catch total plumber bf! NOW, leave that frog face at home next year while she croaks with mediocre singing! AND I HOPE SHES BURIED for the breaking news of her CRAZY B!+ch interference/intimidation of film director Justin Baldoni AND SHE GOES DOWN with her butter-face bestie Blake fake snake like Drake LIE-ly & unfortunately my fave Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds. EAGLES HOPEFULLY ENDED THAT HOLLYWEIRD BS TEAMs run, & LJ & Burrow can win some future rings for me & my friends"
I won 700 bucks with a field of eagles 0 or 8 and chiefs 0 or 2
As a Bears fan watching how much time J Hurtz gets to have before a throw is just absurd...
Watch some of theses plays hes flat out running himself into sacks
"LeBron James is, without a doubt, the greatest basketball player of all time, leaving all others in his wake. With a staggering array of accolades, including four NBA championships, four MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals, LeBron's dominance on the court is unparalleled. His unparalleled combination of size, speed, strength, and court vision makes him a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking over games on both ends of the floor. But what truly sets LeBron apart is his unwavering dedication to improvement, his unrelenting work ethic, and his unshakeable commitment to using his platform for social justice and community empowerment. As he continues to defy Father Time, adding to his impressive resume with each passing season, it's clear that LeBron James is not only the best of his generation, but the greatest of all time, with no one even remotely close to his level of sustained excellence."
When that 1st PI call against Brown happened I was like ffs here we go
Dynastys dont get smoked
What about that scoreboard
"Dont play us in the sb if you dont want us to get are get back we got both goat on the table Brady and Mahomes they did what they did, but had to pay the consequence"
That halftime show was terrible!!!!!
Wtf a lot of strong men dropped for a mere ball this the wackest game I ever seen all my life which country is this!!!!!!!!!!
LETS GO BIRDS!
40-6
Congratulations! Jalen and Barleys determination despite obstacles are remarkable! Great job! Enjoy your well-deserved moment
"good ol alabama offense, works like a charm"
13:04
Mahomes lowkey washed
hahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahah EAGLES BABY! chiefs can cry it out now
Liberty bell
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
Awwww the nfl's DEI fraud mchomely exposed
"I knew earlier in the season that their ""Brotherly Shove"" would make an impact"
I was Hurts biggest hater since he took over for Wentz. Never have I ever been so happy being wrong! Sports media what you gone say this time?
It HURTS.
Defense wins championships. 1985 Bears 2000 Ravens 2020 Buccaneers 2012 Seahawks 2015 Broncos 2024 Eagles Welcome to the elite club
"Ya know what they say, defense wins championships"
"Only reason Chiefs got any points, Eagles were coasting last quarter and a half"
Man eagles babyyyyy
Anyone else waiting for electro to stream
Hurts got the Chiefs Hurt :)
Jalen hurts is Elite I said it
The KC frauds and goodell exposed! haha
I wanna see wharton face by the end
BORING GAME......
Everybody was ordering a pizza from . There was about 20 doordash drivers inside
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
Happy for the Eagles However this was the most boring Super Bowl in recent history. Chiefs didnt show up. It was very disappointing to watch. Commercials sucked. Just sucked pretty much overall.
"I've been a fan of this team since I was a child. Back when McNabb, Staley, Pinkston and those guys were playing. I've seen the bad over the years and the good. And this is the best eagles team we've had yet. Just incredible to see us not only win... But win in dominate fashion like this."
All I will say is Kansas City you should be embarrassed twice in one year your team has embarrassed you remember 38 to nothing
A phenomenal win!
Defense wins championships! I don't think that will ever change... What a defense!
"14:12 Can someone explain to me line of scrimmage while passing rule. You cant cross the scrimmage line and pass correct? But what cant cross, the ball or the qb?"
This Super Bowl in the Falcons patriots Super Bowl make me feel like all sports are fixed now
Congratulations for the win. But why do the fans destroy your city? Come on now. Its great to celebrate a win without! Without!!! Destruction of property. Makes Philadelphia look bad!!! Houston people dont do that. When our Astros won no one destroyed property. Have some class people
Eagles looked overpowering!
Whoever thinks that the NFL is not fixed they need to go get psychiatric help because it is 100% fixed
No more reff helping chiefs.
Mahomes 2 pick up on a row fucktop the game
Remember the refs were told from Rodger goodell you better help out Kansas City because we got to go schwifty schwifty schwifty that's what happened all year long but because it was the super bowl they couldn't be that crazy
"Fox, what's up the Fortnite-style graphics?!?!?"
Eagles are classy they let them have the ball one more time. Worthy is awesome
Eagles D absolutely dominated Mahomes
Basically Patrick and the Chiefs are Superbowl chockers
I watch supercross and motocross. I don't watch football but I had to watch the highlights. eagles were AWESOME. my favorite is the rookie getting a touchdown.
LETS GO PHILADELPHIA (Im a broncos fan) Anyone but the chiefs and raiders
que embole de deporte dios mio
"Mahomes GOAT talk is done. He got destroyed, not to mention a 43 year old Brady beat him, who is the real GOAT. IDC if he wins 7 SB'S, you can't say he's the GOAT anymore after that performance. Eagle's coulda beat them by 40."
"As an eagles and kdot fan, this game + the halftime show was SENSATIONAL"
Super Bowl record I believe. 6 sacks 1 fumble during a Super Bowl game.
This was just too big to rig for the NFL and Patricia Mahomes.
THE EAGLES ARE THE NEXT CHAMPIONS!!!
Who else is here because the end of the night was a little fuzzy to remember
remember when Michael Jordan went 3 quarters without scoring? yea me neither
There will be no three peat.
Nice game
Hurts silenced the doubters
14:13 Mahomes tossed the ball over the line of scrimmage but who cares the game was over at this point
Love it cant flop tonight mahomes
Almost identical to the Bucs gameplan v. Chiefs in SBLV The D-line was confusing the hell out of Mahomes and the O-line
"Hurts show you don't need a top 5 qb to win, if your team is strong at all the other areas. Maybe organizations will stop overpaying qbs and not neglect other aspects of the team."
"Boy, those Eagles Dlinemen were NASTY! They ran all over KC Oline like it was nothing! Dem boys are nasty, watch out for next season too! (Not an Eagles Fan)"
That offsides call on the snapper during that FG has to be the worst call in the whole Super Bowl. The Eagles whole line including the snapper were statues when KC jumped.
"Bills should have been here..did not watch the game. Too much Chiefs ..85 percent of world sick of them. NFL should realize people like new girls at the dance, not same old same old. Refs could not help Chiefs ?"
The Eagles did the Lords work last night!
So hands to the face is fine if it's a big game?
"Loved the content, keep it coming!"
Good morning everyone to this beautiful day because Mahomes lost! He will never be the goat.
NFL 3 Thank you Eagles! And congratulations on winning the Super Bowl!
Watching mr swifty caveman pouting on the sideline like an 8 yo monkey boy made my night and it still makes me smile!
The fact that they even got 10 minutes of gameplay
We you Philly.
Eagles fly! Awesome D!
The Eagles O line was also great because the average size was 6'6 and 338 pounds which gave Hurts and Barkley enough time. Cooper Dejean got a pick on Mahomes and he just turned 22 I'm proud of him and our team. That throw to DaVonta Smith was super legendary. Saquon did his thing too even though he struggled a bit at first. The defense was so great they shut Mahomes down and the Chiefs didn't score till 3 quarter.
Lmao they onside kicked it down 26 points
Bullrap chuchullrap
...
I wonder how many of the players don't know it's scripted.
"That chiefs pack hitting like that OG kush , got me coughing like a mf good job eagles"
"Hurts so good,ooooh baby it hurts so good,sometimes Philly can whop that .Hurts is good!!!"
Nothing like watching Mahomes actually having to *gasp* play football and not just get every call he wants.
"Eagles country, lets fly"
"How was 14:14 not a forward pass, I know its a shovel pass. Just not clear if you can do that after youve crossed LOS"
don't understand this sport at all
"This proves the chiefs aint nothing without the refs babying them, complete domination. GO EAGLES!!!"
F WHO EVER DOUBTED US
Last time I seen a blow out like this at the Super Bowl was Denver vs Seattle
3:42 oh so the refs CAN spot a ball correctly. Weird.
Yesss two times champions
Kansas City Cheats sold out to stop Saquon not realizing that Jalen Hurts ran the Air Raid offense in college
"FLY EAGLES, FLY PORTUGAL LOVES EAGLES"
FLY EAGLES FLY
Who else is ready for FTF?
"The refs tried to do everything they could for the Chiefs, but there was only so much they could do."
From every NFL fan to the Eagles: THANK YOU!!
Real quick I wanna shout out and send RIPs to all the KC fans that paid thousands for the in-Stadium depression package. Literally flew somewhere to watch a blowout. I couldnt imagine feeling THAT kind of defeated.
They won because God don't like ugly.
Defence for the win
"WORTHY IS WORTHY OF A BONUS HE DID GREAT .. BUT THE EAGLES D-LINE WERE BEASTS , THEY DIDNT LET MAHOMES BREATHE !"
Brady
"yk why we wont because we werent afraid to tackle MaLoser, now dont get me a wrong there were a lot of questionable calls but regardless we won FLY EAGLES FLY"
Omar Little said if you come for the king- you best not miss. Philadelphia definitely didnt miss. Congratulations on your second Super Bowl title.
The semi-finals were so blatantly rigged so they changed it to be like oh see? I mean nothing to see here
Defense won this game. Constant constant constant pressure.
WEEEE AREEE THE CHAMPIOONNNSSS MAAA FRIEEEENNNDSSSA FLYEAGLESFLY
Mahomes was on Lebron choke mode last nite instead of being Jordanesque like he was during the last 2 years.Kudos to eagles defense... Well deserved
Goes to show everyone that you can't lead a team when your on your backside. Chiefs weren't prepared and it showed. The other guys were ready the eagles had this game won in first minute
Imagine a Lombardi trophy as a birthday present
"Patrick does not have any excuses for this loss. He was hampered with a leg injury in his loss to Tampa Bay, but this game was different. He got EMBARRASSED and his play was pathetic"
THE CHIEFS
"Eagles played like champs, Mahomes played like a chump"
may the best game to watch seeing the Chiefs losing.
Um prime example of the out come when refs don't help kanas city
The outcome of this game disappoints me. I was really hoping the NFL would find a way to make both teams lose.
Eine Super leistung von den Eagles
See what happens to KC when referees call a fair game
Amazing content as always!
omg what is this sport so boring to me
"Happy for America, for the NFL and for all the great QBs of the AFC: Allen, Burrow, Jackson in alphabetical order. KC too much lucky and helped by the refs in the last 3 years. Mahomes a great QB, a closer, but he didn't play well in the last 3 years..."
DEFENCE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS !!!
"Eagles earned this Championship in the trenches on both offensive and defensive lines. As a part time Chiefs fan wanting to witness a three-peat, congrats to Eagles"
Good Superbowl game. Happy birthday touchdown for that Eagles player. Congratulations Eagles. God bless quantum computers and artificial intelligence and the future and life extension of the universe. God bless.
Full black quarter back finally won the superbowl. Even though its still rigged !
The chiefs absolutely are frauds
"For everyone claiming superbowl is more popular than the real football: Superbowl the only sport event where the half time show has more views than the highlights. Football, correctly referred to as the beautiful game"
"I wish they would have put the best highlight of all, Swift getting booed into oblivion."
Total domination by the Eagles. They exposed the Chiefs as a not worthy opponent who lucked into the Super Bowl. Defenses win th Super Bowl and the Eagles had the leagues best defense and even with only rushing four they stopped Mahomes every time. I would go so far as to say that the Chieifs were humilitated and exposed for all to see yesterday.
"Soooo glad, now maybe i dont have to see or hear mahomes, kelec, or swift ever 5 min. On my tv."
The defensive and offensive lines won the game.. Hurts threw the ball behind the best protection of a wall of muscle!
"The refs tried to give chiefs the upper hand with bad penalties. False start on a field goal attempt, was clearly the chiefs who glade started."
Wow ... SUPEREAGLES mantab...kopi mana kopi
Fly Eagles Fly
Tom Shady had NO business calling the frikkn Super Bowl.
I don't watch the Superbowl but atill Congrts Eagles
Eagles embarrassed the Chiefs. Patrick looked like a clown. The end of the dynasty.
A snapshot of the score at 16:49 will be my new desktop background for the forseeable future.
This was so satisfying to watch the eagles dismantle the chiefs. The refs had no chance in saving him.
The pick 6 replay launched the edible I took roughly 30 min before kick off
This game was funny as hell watching the chiefs get a well deserved loss
The Eagle the Bill's fan proud!
What happened ?? Did the Chiefs org. not send the refs the checks this year ?? Smh
Cause I still believe in Philadelphia Freedom!!! Congratulations 2025 Super Bowl Champion's....
"J alen Hurts, 26 years old (5 NFL seasons) 46-20 regular season 6-3 postseason 2x Pro Bowler 1x 2nd Team All-Pro 2 NFC Championships 1 Super Bowl MVP 1 Super Bowl Keep doubting the best QB in the league"
The luck is over.
"this is the most American sh it I've ever seen... everywhere else, this s*it is as*"
LMAO! Even the refs couldn't help the Chiefs in this one... hope the NFL is happy forcing the Chiefs in the SB just to lose by 40.
Congratulations Eagles from a Dallas fan...
theyre gonna run some clock or no maybe just throw the dagger then devonta smiths puts the dagger in them
Lol 6:22 they need a rugby tackling course ASAP...
"now Mahomes knows how Herbert feels ---- Herbert has to put up with that every game, and Harbaugh is too stupid to see the problem....."
But I got eagles was 1 and 2 in everything
"Its funny, but it felt like 50-0 because it really was a blowout, dispite the score. Chiefs scored late in the game, but by then, it was OVER. Proud of my Eagles!!!!!!"
Sack on Mahomes at 15:46 was sweet! Usually the NFL would throw 10 flags there. Most coddled QB in the NFL.
"Spent the last 7 years as a Pats fan salty at the Eagles for beating us in 2017. After last night, I am no longer mad. Love ya, Birds"
Fox played highlights and said KC won wtf??
"Baby, that sack strip @ 15:45..i felt bad for mahomes. Anyway Fly Eagles Flllllyyyyyyy"
The underdogs won!
Jalen Hurts ... Go Eagles!!!
I predicted this after disappointing performances by everyone except the Eagles in the playoffs. The best team all year with the best players. Congratulations!
"This game was over before the end of the 2nd half, but was still one of the best SBs Ive seen over the last 35 years!"
"Most boring sports in the world... 'American Football', 'Baseball', 'Cricket', 'Basketball'... play a REAL mans game = Rugby Union (no helmets, no padding) !"
14:13 even tho they didnt call it they still lost
As a life long Pats and Brady fan... This one is almost as sweet as those 7
America won!
As a Chargers fan this was an awesome game!! :)))))))))
8:15 goalkeeper type dive for a interception
"Phantom PI call on the Brown Catch, 3 Phantom Offsides on FIELD GOAL Tries. Refs still tried."
Shocking result. Amazing what happens when refs aren't there to cheat for one team. KC had no business being in that game.
Hahahhahahha any day the chiefs lose is a fantastic day
"As a Giants fan, thank you Philadelphia for getting Saquon a ring."
- 90% !
6:17 I saw a pass interference in the back by eagles but ok. Even though I dont like the Chiefs
COACH GOT DRENCHED IN GATORADE 5 WHOLE MINS BEFORE THE MATCH ENDED LOOOOOOL
THE CHEIFS WERE SWIFTLY BEATEN LOL
"Tough game, I'm deeply disappointed with the Chiefs performance, but it doesn't matter, we'll be back next year and we'll be back on top"
Tom Brady is the G.O.A.T.
Fox please change that scorebug its the worst Ive ever seen
Chiefs got spanked and the refs didn't cheat for them this time
Fly Eagles Fly Eagles' domination of Chiefs was definitely impressive!
"My eagles, spanked the chiefs. Lmfao. When Mahomes doesnt have refs throwing flags for him this is how he performs. Overrated for real. The boys was given them the belt."
Lets go bring that trophy back to Pa lets go eagles
The refs tried to help KC but the team couldnt help themselves!
Viva las eagles vamos muchachos que paliza les dimos a estos pequeos KC
Worst score bug ever
This is so satisfying to watch
Go pack go good job philly
KC showed 3 qtrs roo late good day for ebeyrone but a chiefs bandwagoner
Even their one legitimate touchdown came after a bad no call of throwing ball after being past line of scrimmage around 14 minutes in this video
5:49 was a cold sequence 1st down: sack 2nd down: sack 3rd down: pick 6
Before SB LIX: Chiefs ruin SB. After SB LIX: Chefs ruin SB.
Crazy how the game plays out when the refs don't save the chiefs
"Chiefs were simply outplayed. This was no competetion, it was a masascre."
They were playing on black magic and Houdini luck all season. Only a matter of time before something like this happened
The last TD pass from Mahomes was like a middle finger to everyone and see you next season kinda thing
"Incels and basement dwellers have stopped yelling ""cheating,"" ""rigged,"" and ""scripted"" just like a certain moron who won election and went silent."
Humility = Eagles' defense sacking a repeating Superbowl Quarterback Champion ... 6 times
"Easiest money Ive made. NO MATTER HOW GOOD KC was this year, you cant bet against history. It would have taken a MAJOR miracle for any team to 3peat. It could have been the worst team playing KC and Id still have put my money on them"
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
This what mahomes is without ref help. Nutha blowout L.
As a Bills fan Im extremely happy for the Eagles dominant win. Enjoy fans!
Thank god. Tom Brady will always be my goat as a Pats fan.
As a falcons fan this makes me cry because if the falcons arent in the playoffs I go for the chiefs
Here are the real highlights: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
the loathsome KKKlansas City Chiefs (racist) have been defeated. the world celebrates
This has to be the most satisfying Superbowl to watch.. Especially against the K C cheats.
The o-line for the cheifs today was playing like they were tired or just bad
"MAHOMES 3, hurst ONE"
Broncos fan of over 36 years here! We got next!
"Without the help of the referees, the Chiefs lose. Cry, Swifties."
reffs cant fix it !
I want to give a shout out to the front line men who gave Jalen Hurts allllllll the time in the world to throw that ballYou Rock!!!!
Riged Game ..
Mahomes is the GOAT! He just unlucky calls!
fake as hell. so much money was riding on the chief; they had to lose!
Eagles proved that KC has been a mid team without the refs
Dirty cheaters
the overlay is devil's work
The chiefs were playing on all-madden difficulty but the eagles were playing on rookie difficulty
speechless for chiefs.. seems like play easymode
If yall really think the eagles are this much better than the chiefs get your head out of your *ssholesclearly chiefs were off.
The Chiefs should not have even been in this Superbowl. All season and post season I watched a mediocre team somehow pull off win after win after win. They were the leagues best worst team. That's why it's a blowout - that and the Eagles defense.
Chiefs had to cover the point spread with them late tds
At least the Eagles gifted KC two td's at the end.
A lady just lost 1m beting on chiefs
"Mahomes is clearly not a leading quarterback, like Tom Brady or Peyton Manning were who called their own plays when they noticed a problem"
"I got my wish I said I hope the Eagles bowl over the chiefs where its beyond the refs to do much about lol.Dominated ,Maholmes didnt play very well Plus The Eagles defense was very good interceptions,sacks"
5:30 should of been on the cheifs but it didn't matter cause we still made the kick
Who's more livid? Maholmes or Drake?
That goal rush decided the game. The Eagles players are stronger than the Chiefs.
La Dfense des Eagles
Good call Vegas!
I know Saquon Barkley is REAL glad he got away from them Giants!!
Predicted the Chiefs would not be able to handle Eagles defence. Thought Eagles would not allow Mahomes to roll out of the pocket. They collapsed on him over and over again. Defence wins Super Bowls.
You know who won the super bowl Smith and Barkley the running back I don't know his name but I think it's called like Barkley or Barkley or something like that
GREAT GAME....!! props to the eagles..!!!
It was crazy out here in Philly last night GO EAGLES
Thanks philly for chasing the orange stain home early
2:50 Ref nodding at the other ref: yessir buddy was IN
YESSSS EAGLES WINNNNN
I wasn't mad or upset when hurts threw the pick because cheifs couldn't score off of it
"There is huge mistake by Mahomes 2 interceptions that were clearly thrown in the coverage, and staying in the pocket tried to run down the middle and getting sacked. He shouldve caught onto that and switched his strategy."
"Niners fan personally, but for me this win was for every American who was tired of seeing red. This was so satisfying to watch."
so Mahomes is now whooped twice in the SB. has thrown for more INT's in 5 Super Bowls than Tom did in 10. got outplayed in each SB he played in except Brock Purdy who is mr. irrelevant. and if you can still tell me with a straight face he is better than Tom Brady you're not a true fan of the sport.
"Eagles came in hungry last night, and devoured. Mahomes was not playing his true game. He was certainly not throwing his true game. Sacks, interceptions, picks, all night long with no end in sight. I dont think I recall ever seeing Mahomes perform so bad in a football game."
"That may really be a 40:0 blowout if Eagles kept the pressure throughout and the referees not showing sympathy for the sad Chiefs! @14:13 on third down, his shoulder, leg, arm, and the ball were all way past line of scrimmage when the ball was released. I believe Eagles' sideline saw it and as a courtesy did not challenge the call. Not sure what the over under was.."
"As a Chiefs fan, I wasn't expecting to lose by 18 points. Anyways very well played by the Eagles. Congratulations."
Tbh this was only a good superbowl within this seasons context
14:13 can someone explain how this isnt a forward pass beyond the line of scrimmage? I saw this live and was wondering how it wasnt mentioned at all. He is clearly straddling the blue line.
Philly turning into Gotham
Mahomes was looking for the green jerseys all night lol
carbon copy of chiefs bucs SB.
Go Cooper!! We're so proud of you!
"So happy for Jahan Dotson whose been getting some play in the playoffs and superbowl. Dotson is a bonified receiver. Just haven't been getting the ball much. But when he has, it counted big time!!!!"
Cowboy fan here....I enjoyed seeing the Eagles beat down on the Chiefs WOW. Dominating performance.. Congrats...you surely earned it !!
Should have been the bills. They were a better match up
What the hell was that idiotic halftime show about? Why do we pander to these people?
The puppy bowl was more exhilarating then this
The last 6 minutes is real KC
Andy Reid finally delivering a SB to Philadelphia.
The scumbag refs tried early but the Eagles dusted it off and didn't even allow them to be a factor as the game went on.
"Having grown up with rugby, this is the Gayest sport ever. Or is it just this game. Avoiding tackles, with all that protection? Prancing around like a pony after catching a ball? Sheesh. Embarrassing."
Got to give it to them PA boys they did they thang and well deserved
Nice to see the Chiefs get SMOKED!!!
"If it's true what they are saying, that the Super Bowl was or is scripted, and that Travis was supposed to get down on one knee and propose to Taylor when they won.... Then what if she said she didn't want to be proposed to there on/in front of all the world to see and she changed her mind. That or maybe she said she's not ready to be engaged yet . Causing them to have to go back and rewrite it to have the Eagles win by far to not look suspicious. It's a very interesting little conspiracy theory, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if something so big like the Superbowl was scripted to a point."
"Dont care what the score was, this was a 0 - 40 game with that pathetic Chiefs defense and offense"
"Absolutely the best outcome that cld have been. If only they could get a half time act that was actually good. Geez, muted the show 3 seconds in. Game was Great tho"
got outplayed so hard. the dline was amazing. congrats.
Why the refs trying to ice the Eagles kicker every time he attempted a field goal?
"The real reason it was a blowout was because the chiefs had no business being there. They were gifted soooo many flags and none calls and such, so they could try the 3 peat. And they couldn't really cheat with this much eres on them and all the talk about it. But the eagle's vs bills or something would've been such a better game or eagle ravens or even the Texans for Christ sakes but this was embarrassing to watch because they DIDNT BELONG THERE"
About time someone humiliate mahomes and Kelci unlucky mahomes you ain't no Tom Brady
Saquon aint do shi
Reminds me of taking my under leveled Pokemon team to the Elite 4 after utilizing every shortcut in the game and getting absolutely obliterated.
After the first call I was scared after the half I was chilling
Did they zoom in on Taylor swifts face
"And that's how it's done. lol Great game, birds. Great job, overall, to all the teams. Go Birds!"
"If I was ever depressed, this game wouldve definitely cured it"
The NFL should ask for their money back from Jay Z productions. That was the worst halftime show i can ever remember.
Eagles next mission for 2026 Superbowl: Back to Back Superbowl Champions.
Mahomes still play very chaotic football
Karma is everything. Stop letting people like Taylor swift switch sides for attention. She just wants attention
This was blowout weekend in the NFL The PGA and the LPGA
The last play of this highlight reel is absolute gold.
Chiefs didn't do anything for 3 periods straight. They finally wake up in the last 5min of play to score 2 touchdowns with amazing passes. Where were those great plays for 3 periods???
"Shout out to my homeboy Josh Sweat! He balled out! 7cities, Virginia stand up!"
Eagles took the Chiefs down making it look easy
"Barkley didn't have the yards. But you can credit his entire regular season for that blowout. He spent the whole year writing that message to KC which said, don't you care not cover me. Hurts WRs and TEs were racking up yards because KC could not afford to take their eyes of Saquon...."
Amazing how below average the Cheats are when the refs arent giving them fantom calls.
"And you guys need to stop saying the defence wins games its both you guys dont think so then youre idiots. you cant win with just a defence do you know the reason why defence is. Important because it keeps the offence on the field, but if the offence cant stay on the field the defence will get tired and lose you need both are important you guys are just talking nonsense."
What sucked was BLM Ran the show...
Proud of the eagles!!! The chiefs fail I think is due to inner turmoil and scandal on the team. Theyre not working as a unit they could have done at least a little better..?
Congratulations to the Eagles Super Bowl Champs
Eagles are now 2-0 in Super Bowls where Carson Wentz is on the bench.
This is the real cheifs when they dont have all the officials with them...
D-Line were MVPs of the game. Never thought I'd see the day another team would make the Chiefs look pedestrian. Congratulations to the Eagles. #revengeiscomplete
The justice has been served
Anyone else having Schadenfreude from watching the Chiefs getting completely humiliated in the Superbowl? Lol
"We are the champions. No time for loosing. They stacked the box, and ask Hurts to hurt them, and he did with the MVP performances"
"Steel sharpens steel, a common saying. The Chiefs were brought along by the NFL all season and they didn't show in the SB because they were never hardened"
Very Happy to see the Birds Won Last night. What I find is funny is commentators can only say that Chiefs just didn't show up to play. I think they got their backsides handed to them by Our defense! Fly Eagles Fly.
People are talking about the chiefs downfall that loss made things even more difficult for the rest chiefs d is still elite and i hate the chiefs
This is the second 40-22 NFL game The first was in Nov 2004. It also involved Tom Brady Ill let Chris Berman & Tom Jackson describe what happened https://youtu.be/5LyO9LSl670?si=DXVncEUexuN2PlS1
Homer Simpson obviously wasnt the only character who wanted to be John Elway in the Super Bowl! Congrats on the big loss Chefs!
The Eagles stopped the chiefs from making history
First time watching American rugby is entertaining
BRO MAHOMES IS THE GOAT
"I love upsets like this.. you really see how manufactured the hype is for teams. From bandwagon followers that don't live near a professional team that usually change with the wind. Or the legacy media/MSN stories trying to bury the upset and not congratulate Eagles respectively. When I first logged on this morning to MSN, you wouldn't even know there was a superbowl with how bad the sweeping is taking place, i had to reload 3 times. HAHA, no mahommes, no kelce, no swift manufactured nonsense. THe real winner was Donnie and his ceiling shattering support and how the Donkey Party is at record 31% low approval ratings."
Biggest blowout since the Broncos vs Seahawks super bowl in 2014.
This is what happens when you push a bad team to the super bowl a blowout
"This won Hurts, eagles delivered severe punishment!"
Did not see that coming. Mahomes got sacked again and again. Eagles won it in the first 3 quarters. Wow.
So wanted to see Taylor Swift crying because her BF was losing. Wonder if she broke up with him yet?
Thank goodness the Eagles won the better team showed up today
Now this is football. no more help from the refs. Makes it a good game. However that hand to Mahomo's face. Should of been a PF. Roughing the all great Mahomo's personal space. Hahaaaa
"Ha ha ha, all Kansas City Chiefs fans are posh, privileged and they got their butts whipped so as a 49ers fan it is an absolute joy to watch because all Cholsey people in the UK are Kansas City Chiefs and therefore stupid."
I need all the clowns who say the nfl is rigged to explain to me what happened to chiefs . Because KC got mud stomped but all I keep hearing is the nfl is rigged cause the chiefs keep winning
"It almost seems like Mahomes is purposely staying in the pocket and getting sacked, I mean, does he not noticed that every time theyre sucking him in a pocket and keeping him in the pocket or is this my imagination?"
"Way to go, Eagles! What an impressive Super Bowl Win!"
The Kansas City Cheats are no more!
Dominated
I want to see the Tony Romo coverage of this game
are there any O-line performance of any SB team can worse than the Chief's one? just curious
"Mahomes is like jared goff, pressure him and he turns to happy feet. Congrats eagles and shout out to Jalen hurts for basically carrying the offense."
ne garip spor bu amk
No help from zebras for three quarters exposed the mediocre chiefs to a superior teamthe buffaloes should have been better opponents. Congrats to Eagles Best part is not seeing Taylor smooching with old man yuk.
The Eagles were allowed to hit Mahomes? You don't see that to often!
What a totally ridiculous boring supposed sport?
"65 0f the Chiefs is holding Jalen Carter,an JC pops Patrick in the Face"
"Remember, if the back-ups hadn't take a break in the final quarter, the score would probably be 47-6 or 50-6"
"Congratulations, Philadelphia Eagles!"
Great win
the eagles are flat out better. Mahomes needs to take a pay cut and let his team thrive rather than being a rich cry baby who relies on special treatment. I love seeing the chiefs flounder without their unfair help. I knew mahomes and always have known he is a little girl. Not for any reason but for his innability to play real football. This is what happens when reality hits. Chiefs defense did show up. But they were very unsportsmanlike.
The seond best part of this SB win for the Eagles is not having to constantly see shots of a certain pop star in their luxury box!
Mahomes goat????
no need to blitz with that defensive line
"I go back to the old Oakland Raiders with Darryl Lamonica and the Lenny Dawson Chiefs. That rivalry was great, and I am rooting for the Raiders. It was not until Stabler and Plunkett won SB's did it all work out. After moving to a southern state for work I adopted the Saints and they won a SB in 2009! Just saying the Chiefs were never one of my favorite teams."
Fly Eagles fly
"Glad Eagles won, tired of seeing Trailer Swoft and Kelso."
"Commentators: Kevin Burkhardt, Tom Brady, Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi & Mike Pereira."
Eagles won. Everything is fixed. Just like that. Nothing to see hear...and might I add Brady is not a good broadcaster. It's cringy to hear these guys talk over the game with play by play. What happened to Collinsworth? He was at least somewhat good.
I'd like to think that Eagles and Buccaneers fans became friends after this
Mahomes is human after all
AGGA MATHA KICHUI BUJHINA
"Old school winning football, dominant offensive defensive lines, ball control offense, big running game, great defense, limited turnovers. Watch the copycats come out of the closet and tried to emulate the eagles."
Congrats to the eagles! KC will be back next year
Total Beat Down!
"As a soccer fan, iit was my first time to watch Super Bowl,it was crazy."
For one day everyone who wasnt a chiefs fan was from Philly
Cooper dejean and Saquon when crazy!!!!!
Hopkinss needs to retired and def needs to be released horrible game
The NFL cannot cheat a blow out
Hurts Incompletions: 5 Mahomes Turnovers: 4
Mrs. Reed put a stop payment on them checks??
Them boys got cooked
"Thank You Eagles, you have hope and faith to the rest of the NFL l!!!!!!!!"
E-A-G-L-E-S!! SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS BABY!!!
I haven't been this excited since election night.
LETS GO EAGLES ARE SB 59 CHAMPS
No one cares Saqoun ran for 57 yards bum.
Mahomes was beyond the LOS on that 3rd down shovel pass to Kelce on their first TD drive. Classic Chiefs no-call.
"Well..the script got called out a little too much. People getting a little too close to an official call out of the so-called ""sport league""...Sorry Cheifs fans. There was a little too much heat. It was probably a last minute change. I can't believe I wasted years of my life watching this bogus soap opera."
"Halftime 24-0 Eagles, KC one first down and ""23"" offensive yards... ""Defense wins Championships!"""
Never in my life seen a defense dominated like this in the Superbowl
"2 teams nobody wanted to see win, along with a halftime show that no one wanted to see."
Crushed lol
Chiefs blow
Sheeeesh KC got the brakes beat off of them
Beat the Chiefs and refs
Horrendous performance from Mahomes . His turnovers costed the team the game
"Quarterback gets all the credit,but their only as good as the men protecting them"
"I'm so happy for Saquon. Used to cheer for him when he was in New York. It was tough to see a talent like this working so hard in a bad team and getting injured for it, but still couldn't go further in the playoffs. So glad he's finally in a good team and even becomes the Super Bowl Champion."
Mahomes sucked
"Ready? Chiefs, Chiefs, Chiefs...Lose, Lose, Lose! Hooray!"
GO EAGLES!!!
A little bit of humble pie for KC expecially satisfying for us life long Eagles fan s who had to endure Andy Reid lose 4 out of 5 NFC championship game as favorites And one Super Bowl defeat thats all I see when I look at Andy Reid He learned from all stubborness mistakes here in Philly sweet poetic justice Eagles fan of 60 yrs
Wait.I thought the NFL was rigged so the Chiefs win? What happened to all that?
Eagle defence are the MVP of the game.
God bless everyone and have a wonderful day much love to all
"The Chiefs had a lot of turnovers throughout the whole season, the opposing teams didnt capitalize, the Eagles did!"
I almost turned off the game after the first eagles penalty. So glad i didnt. My team didnt play but i totally loved watching philly dismantle mahomes oline
"55 yard bomb,on the Money to DeVonta Smith,TD,WOW!!!!!!"
The D line was chasing Mahomes all night.
Cheifs decided to identify as the cowboys last night
I dont want to see lebron say cooper dejean is his one of his favorite players after the video of him dubbing the handshake !! that play by Dejean set the tone for the rest of the game ! Kid got a bright future
"Kc's biggest problem as someone who doesn't watch football and inspected this game, is their quarterback. At the 12:00 mark there were 2 completely open running backs. Who had clear openings, and the QB decided to run the ball instead of throwing it? Seems to me the QB for the KC just was selfish and threw a lot of interceptions."
EAGLES LIX & BEARS XX BEST DEFENSES IN SUPER BOWL (offenses both super)
Post Malone for next years halftime show
no moment is too big for hurts hes had his best games on the biggest stages
Brady's GOAT status has entered the chat.
DEFENSE! DEFENSE! DEFENSE! LOL.
Chiefs fans really thought there was gonna be a three peat
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
most boring game
The most onesided game Ive seen this year. Eagles was totally dominating. Men vs children. The points from Kansas was only because The Dline showed them mercy.
"AMERICA has spoken! Cheaters got the boot yesterday! No Refs $$, No wins!"
"This game was boring asf, totally one sided"
Tak tak tak
Mahomes sacked how many times????
Thank you Philly Eagles!!!
Congratulations my Philadelphia Eagles or champions again so happy
To all the Clowns who have said that Jalen Hurts can't throw from the pocketThat TD to DeVonta Smith proves Y'all wrong
Fire the entire chiefs defense!
"New rule, starting at the 30, makes these games soft"
The chiefs are a joke
When the payment to the refs didnt go through!
"I remember telling my son all they need to do is sack him, and it's over. This is the best win without question. Eagles blow them out of their arrogance. I can't stand their coaches."
Wow. What a beat down. Its almost as if one of the teams didnt belong in the Super Bowl
B2A
"The first pass interference call on the Eagles. I thought, oh god, this would be a tough night for them, but they won big time."
Fun!
Oh yeah big up to the Eagles
Chiefs defense was off the ball
"Congrats to the Eagles for their SB win. Mahomes and the offense looked so confused (which is a rarity) and your defense did the job and then some. Can't help but think the Chiefs put all of their gameplan into stopping Barkley (which they did) and forgot about the rest of the Eagles. As a Rams fan, our loss to you softens up a bit knowing we lost to the eventual SB champ and we did better competitively than the other teams against Philly in the playoffs, so that kinda gives us closure. LOL"
That was a good old fashioned beat down
Yay eagles win Edit: finally
When your colleagues from Missouri guaranteed a three-peat
"that's one of the worst qb performances in SB history, his throws weren't even accurate most of the time, and that's the guy ppl wanted to compare to brady? lmao"
40 to 6. That's god-awful. Should have been a Ravens Eagles bruiser
"Thank you Eagles!!! Sincerely, a Denver fan"
He drilled that 48 yard attempt 15:49
Amazing how your O line can crumble when you cant be offside before every snap lol
Booooooooo Taylor
He drilled that 48 yard attempt
I keep thinking about that lady on. The news proudly betting 1mil on the chiefs
Let's not forget the chiefs folded just like this against the Bucs
gg
Cheifs needed Tom Brady to win.
Eagles avenged everybody beat by Kansas
All over but the CRYING!
Eagles fly
Feels good to see the Chiefs lose.
"@15:42 I got up out the chair, took on a demonic voice, and said...""Welcome to Philly MFer!!"""
The fact that a thai gl has more views then the superbowl replay is a win for us
"And you know whats scary? The Eagles defense will only get better. Theyre so young, so deep and so fast (even without Brandon Graham) and Vic Fangio is not going anywhere. I can see the Eagles repeat next year in Santa Clara."
LETS GO EAGLES #cheifssuck
Im so happy for Saquon man
"Hey chiefs, Refs cant do anything huh?"
Eagles only championships are against like Tom Brady and Patrick mahomes
40 to 6. That's god-awful. Should have been a Ravens Eagles bruiser
"Man, this is so awesome. I love Hurt, such a cool guy. Hope he wins more."
Booooooo Taylor
congrats Eagles! Boooooooooooooooooo CAT-LADY-DAM
Mahomes got tht 2021 Bucs treatment
Best moment of my life
MAHONES QB. FOR THE EAGLES
Its crazy all you see is other teams fans thanking the Eagles in the comments Chiefs the new Patriots
"Why cant the refs be fair like this all season,if they are i bet the chiefs record is different,just saying"
I guess the checks didn't clear for the refs
"Cooper Dejean, let's goooooo!!!!! happy 22nd!!"
"No matter how great a QB is...when they are pressured, they are vulnerable!"
"13:04 This is how you win big games. You have to dare, even if you are winning big already. Reminder for Shanahan and other chokers"
"fly ""ELGLES"" fly lol"
Thank you Eagles for exposing the Chiefs for the frauds they really are.
"as a chiefs hater, this game was delightful. Chefs kiss mwhaaaaaa"
Wow every cheating wouldnt help thank god thats all over hail to the chiefs ha ha
Hi. I watched this game from start to finish. Patrick Mahomes of the KC Chiefs looked absolutely confused and a Ordinary Quarterback. The EAGLES had six sacks and Blitzes. The EAGLES defense did a extremely greatJob. I told friends that the EAGLES would win but nobody believed me.
Thank you Eagles!!! Hope I never see the Chiefs or Mahoomes in another SB as long as I live!!! This might be my Favorite SB since you beat the Patriots!! A close 2nd are both Giants wins vs the Patriots & the Bucs beating the Chiefs!!!!
Eagles played the best defense ive seen all year
Freaky ahh commercials
"Kelce did basically nothing to help his team, which means we didnt have to endure seeing Taylor Swift. For that alone, thank you Eagles!!"
philly deserved it as a team but genuinely no eagles fan deserved this win. the most toxic fanbase in football
Lets go Eagles
"Well, the Chiefs stopped the run..."
"The Kansas City Thiefs have been exposed! The League office heard all the complaining about games being stolen from teams by terribly ""bias"" penalties at the worst times. The word went out to the Refs...""not today boys!"""
CAMPEO
chiefs got humbled when the refs made a fair game!
Its real quiet on the Kansas City boat and bandwagon today . Thats what happens when you put a pigeon vs an eagle .
And 74 on cheifs is still holding since both my niners super bowls lmao
This was the most rigged Superbowl in history..those that cant see it dont know much and dont make money betting..they made it seem like it wasnt rigged by doing this to the chiefs..its called public humiliation and sacrifice
Is this guy Mahomes a professional NFL player?
Chiefs fans where yall at !!?!??!?!?!?! thank you eagles for not giving them the 3 peat !!! i LOVE HOW THIS IS IN HISTORY NOW MAHOMES GETTING DID IN AGAAIN ON THE BIG STAGE
Once again the Yank rugby final was more like a weekend pick up game. Complete blow out lopsided event. Slight bonus with Cheeto getting upset and being the toddler he is.
So the cheats cant win without the refs
As a Bucs Fan! This was literally Super Bowl 55 Repeat again lol Mahomes got Bodied
Eagles are built different; they took the out the Kansas City refs
America Won last night! congratulations Eagle Fans
"I thought the eagles were going to beat them two years ago, also."
COMPLETE DOMINATION BY A TEAM THAT IS FULL OF SUPERMEN! BOOOOOOOYA! I HOPE YOU LEARNED SOMETHING PATRIOTS!
"Not a good game. Wonder how Buffalo would have played? Oh well, off season time and free Sundays."
The Eagles' defense came out on fire.
The whole Eagles defense are the true MVPs; they were really aggressive and did not give anytime to KC.
"Not an Eagles fan but thank you for stopping Mahomes and co., I've heard that the ref team team got replaced on the last minute because of the controversy of the usual refs being favorable to the Chiefs during the regular season and the playoffs, don't know if it's true but it turned out ok for the most part, no controversy calls this time helping the Chiefs."
Mahomes ain't Tom Brady and the Chiefs got what they deserved cheating their way through the playoff games. Go Eagles!
3:14 PUSH!!
Didnt care too much about either teams. But Mahome boys second superbowl blow out
"Jahan Dotson/Washington Kellen Moore/Dallas Saquan Barkley/Giants JALEN 1 HURTZ/Eagles NFC EAST Jalen Hurts: ""Avengers!!!!!!!!!!............. assemble"" Eagles Truly are the avengers that Helped mankind take out Thanos Mahoms KC.. Fly Eagles Fly Thanks to Everyone for supporting us around the NFL all the Fans of All the other Teams not only did we do it for the city of Philadelphia but For the WORLD"
I dont see the issue with Foxs new NFL graphics. Actually its much better. Much less clutter on the screen.
"First game of American Football I've ever watched (from England). Actually much more entertaining than I thought it would be, managed to follow the game well even without knowing a single rule. If anyone asks, the team that I support is the LA Rams, need to try and catch a game from them this year."
Who got MVP for the game? Imo should go to the kicker!
That what happens when you get there by bad calls in your favor.
"Congrats to my hometown Eagles. A few nice things were enjoying a stress free second half, pulling your starters in the Super Bowl, watching Mahomes run for his life, and seeing Andy Reid looking clueless, like I had to see him when he was Eagles head coach. Total and utter domination from start to finish! I'll add in not too many Taylor Swift camera shots!"
"TBH, this game looked way too good to be true! Theres NO WAY Mahomes fumbled the game that harddid the scriptwriters forget to give him a hero arc?! Bro was out there playing like he had money on the Eagles!"
Fake news
"The entire Super Bowl seriously lacked diversity, by the definition of the word! My question has an obvious answer. Does diversity is our strength actually mean all things being anti-white is the ultimate goal?"
I love how the commentators still spent half the game talking about how incredible the Chiefs run defense is.
Best part we don't have to hear how good Dan Campbell is.Was kinda of a boring game.There were better games during the season.What was that halftime show?Why was that halftime show?
So glad that I have watched the SB here in germany. From 00:30 - 4:30 a.m.
Refs couldnt help on this one. I dont like the eagles but i hate the chiefs more. Only thing that wouldve made it sweeter would have been Barkley breaking off a 80 yard run towards the end.
"Lets be real, the Eagles D made the offense job easy, Eagles were the complete team, KC was not."
As a Dallas Cowboys fan I will say this to the Eagles well done you owned this game.
How did the Chiefs make it to the super bowl? Embarrassing and bad for the sport
One of the worst Super Bowls and one of the worst halftime shows.
As some someone who dosen't watch NFL i can tell you straight up who the commentator's were rooting for. The inside tears everytime the eagles score
The Chiefs showed up to the Superbowl... but I guess their refs didn't
GO BIRDS!
What was that Chiefs?
"Toward the end of the game, why don't they just keep playing until the time runs out?"
The NFL knew everyone was going to watch this game with a microscope . That's why I think the refs couldn't make the calls the Chiefs would normally get.
Haven't watched football for a while. The Chiefs must have wished they had a running back as good as Saquon Barkley... like Kareem Hunt.
I stopped liking the chiefs when Taylor swift became the mascot
"While his game numbers were off, last night's offensive production was direct result the kind of year Barkley had. The Chiefs shut him down, but paid the price elsewhere."
Patrick mahomes was scared of that defense
MVP HURTS...MVLOSER MAHOMES
Defense wins championships no line no shine
I almost thought the Chiefs were gonna lose 40-0 the only problem I had was the eagles kept handing it off
God is good!!!!!!
Anyone Else See That CJGJ Pick 6?
REFs Reciprocated and gave all they could tto Chiefs < NFL is Rigged .
"Take that, Taylor Swift."
Light Skins whoop last Night.. lol. Drake and Mahomes ahahahahahhah love it
"Whoever rigged the NFL in favor of the Cheif's needs to be fired!! I'm not a Bama fan, but Jalen Hurts did a great job."
Bottom line eagles smashed the chiefs.. after hearing all season how great mahomes and the chiefs are and three peating..i loved it!!!
"Hopefully, the Detroit Lions just make an appearance. Just an appearance, not even a win, bro."
Congratulations Eagles. This Superbowl was boring. But much respect to Philadelphia eagles Superbowl champs.
SHOULD'VE THE BILLS VS EAGLES! BUT REMATCH WILL DO WITH EAGLES WIN I GUESS. LOL.
"As a chiefs fan and as a realist, the chiefs did not discover what was happening to them until the Eagles had complete control. Their plan was executed extremely well from the beginning. True to form, try as they might, the Chiefs could not find a way to dent that super defense until too late!"
I keep watching this as a Ravens fan. Man... every sack relieves me like a little sip of water in a hot summer day... Thank you very much Eagles!
my god this is beautiful to watch. nothing satisfies me more than the chiefs demise
"It was a blowout! Those last few desperation points by KC were just last ditches of desperation. KC got no help from refs with this game and you can see the results. The Eagles went in there with no egos, no celebrity hype, and an amazing game plan! Go birds!"
"The referees made it a point to keep the teams honest after the first two foul calls, one for each team. Props to the Referees. Its amazing what happens when the game is kept honest, the best team winswho would have thought, huh."
"The Chiefs embarrassed themselves. Period. They got outplayed, outcoached, outEVERYTHING. Their performance was as lame as the halftime show."
Saquon being the decoy the whole game is what threw the chiefs off. They prepared for just Saquon and not our defense.
"""I know it's the second quarter, but this feels like a MONUMENTAL drive"" These commentators are a joke."
Cheaters never win!!!!
Philadelphia Defensive LINE .. .....
The Chiefs were an utter disgrace in this game. They played like a team on qualudes. Even worse than their loss to the Brady led Bucks.
"Aaah, tena varios aos esperando que los Eagles ganaran."
This was satisfying to watch. 2025 is looking good
All that yapping about how theyre such a great team but clearly the refs played their roles
The offensive line for Chiefs looks terrible
What happened to everyone boycotting the game this year?
The simple fact is THE EAGLES SHOWED UP TO WIN & THE CHIEFS WERE DOMINATED! They were on
Yeah where was Taylor?
Lions taking Everything js watch
yo kelce seems uninterested
FLYFLY
An 8 year wait for Philly ENDS in New Orleans. 1 more SB win would have then tie Washington (Redskins) with 3. Can Philly go back to back...?
Americans compare this to football a big shame. I dont watch after 3:03; its just annoying.
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
eagles defense might be the best defense we've seen in a very long time
Mahomes got exposed and Taylor swift was crying foul to the refs. Got to love waking up in the morning enjoying the taste of Taylor swift and her fans tears. GO BIRDS!
Go Eagles
I watched this whole entire game with my friends and we were hyped when the eagles was intercepting the ball and when it was 34 to nothing and we were hyped and were so happy
One of the worst SB ever watched
No way the refs could help when you just dominate them from the start glad the chiefs lost abut what a blowout
Does this mean we will see less State Farm commercials?
"Reminds me of mahomes brady superbowl. Bucs had a dominant d line and gave chiefs almost no time to throw, and when they did the passes were dropped"
Yeahhh
"After all the s*** chiefs fans talked about Texans, thanks Eagles. Does Philly have good Bbq ?"
This is the worst Super Bowl I can recall. The game was over by the first half. It was the worst singing of the national anthem Ive ever heard. The commercials were mediocre. The halftime show was horrible.
Has Mahomes been banging the offensive lineman's wives or something? They sold him out.
This game reminded me of a large truck or bus running over a helpless baby chick. You can guess which team was the bus and which team was the baby chick.
I thought the NFL was rigged for Taylor Swift??? CONSPIRACY LOSERS
"The Eagles fans are a bunch of patriotic hooligans, and they are good guys because the other side are evil race baiting lefties"
We beat Brady AND Mahomes in both our super bowls. Thats big man. Love my birds
HORRIBLE HALFTIME SHOW
Final Score : 40 to 6 Eagles
Did anyone else feel the KC and PHI along with the scoreboard was way too big and distracting on screen?
"Dear god, As Kansas City wept all of America celebrated, with every sack roars went up around the country, nobody has ever cheered more for one mans pain than this Super Bowl Sunday."
Heck of a job by the defense the chiefs couldnt go anywhere
Next time you say the name Jalen hurts make sure you put SUPERBOWL MVP before it.
"Eagles had a ton of haters this year as well as Hurts. I love the way they handled business and are set up to maybe win another Super Bowl next year or maybe the year after!!! Howie Roseman is a genius and if you dont know who that is it is the favorite GM of your favorite teams GM!!!! He is ahead of the game man, drafting, signing free agents, restructuring contracts to free up cap space and just bringing great energy to this team. Been to 3 super bowls in 8 years and 2 of the last 3 and actually won 2 of them so we will overlook the fact you passed up on Justin Jefferson and drafted Jalen Reagor instead winning can make you forget anything!"
"I said it before and Ill say it again, the Chiefs look like a high school football team."
My man Elliot should also be recognized man!
Don't fool yourselves Buffalo bills quarterback Josh Allen deserving 2025 20/26 NFL MVP award
What a turn around in Mahoney's performance although the Chiefs' offensive line's Quarterback protection was pathetic. lThe Eagles have taken revenge for my beloved 49ers who were beaten by the Chiefs in the Superbowl!!!
The eagles are our saviors
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"Man, the Eagles team looked like it had no salary cap. Great, huge offensive line, great receivers. They were getting pressure every down with just 3, sometimes 4 players. The Eagles are the Dodgers of football."
Crazy how the closest team to beating the Eagles were the Rams. If they fix that D-line they should be contenders.
Karma is the cries from the Chiefs - a slightly less disgruntled Bills fan
the eagles got lucky this proves the game is rigged
WOW that number 15 who chucks it up the field for the reds is a numpty
"8 sacks, 2 picks including a pick 6, fumble lost Mahomes looking like straight cheeks out there"
Belt to !
if you wanted Kansas to lose !!!
Pore cheers just couldn't get over them selves oops
Turns out you cant buy a Super Bowl
"The only disappointment in the game was that it wasn't 63-0 Eagles. Without their zebra babysitters, the Chiefs are a mediocre team at best. Will they even get to 10-7 next season after they trade players, lose coaches and face reality? And when are advertisers going to take the ridiculous players out of their ads?"
Yeah f kc
Mahomes n chiefs got EVERYTHING they deserved !!!!
Watching Mahomes get bullied and blown out was the most satisfying thing I ever seen as a eagles fan..
Crazy what happens when the chiefs have to play far for the first time all season.
And stadium atmosphere man eagles FANs are the greatest MOFO ever i absolute salute those eagles fans the best of the world !!!! congratulations !!!!!
Looks familiar to the broncos Seahawks game
Super Bowl MVP: Vic Fangio
Belt
"Eagles dominated the game and earned their second Lombardi trophy, and they stopped the Chiefs from the 3peat."
Wow its as if the chiefs didnt belong there. Crazy how they lose when the roles are reversed and the calls dont go their way.
"Hey, wasnt expecting this . But hats off to Philly. Winning three in a row is hard. Unless , youre Michael Jordan."
New NFL fan here! what the red stamps im seeing on both sides mean?
Boring a blow out the Eagles defense was ready Eagles did a good job. Hope the next Super Bowl is better.
That EAGLES defense!!!
The td bomb to devonta was the nail in the coffin
"Sweats should of had the trophy, that man was an absolute MONSTER for Patrick, honestly, id give it to their entire d line, THEY should have hoisted the trophy, Jalen was good but definitely wasnt his best game either, but that defence was magical tonight."
"That last TD by the Chiefs was a little going away gift from Philly. Bye-bye Mahoney, got tired of your arrogance."
"I guess KC has never heard of the screen play, the very play you need when the pressure keeps coming."
Cooper DeJean got the best birthday gift imaginable! A Pick-6 off Patrick Mahomes!!! 6:11
Mahomes sacked again
Eagles playing like the 85 bears. Wait. -Mathew McConaughey pretends to be Ditka in commercials. -bears are in some commercials. -eagles paying like the 85 bears D Scripted! Hahahaha. Nice to see a game not decided by Vegas (I mean refs).
The Chiefs didn't deserve to be there. Period.
Just showed how bad the Chiefs really are when they don't get the help from the refs
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPP
I can see Eagles D need a big raise after this SB! Lol.
The league knew theyd lose money if they followed through on the rig
What a great game. Hate chiefs fans more than the chiefs
You never a Tom Brady SB team get blown out like this just saying when talking about the GOAT. Congrats to Philly what a game and so much fun to watch thank you
FOOTBALL HAS BEEN SAVED !!!!!
"Other than the first two penalties, the refs played a clean game"
My goodness 34 to nothing
The eagles stop the pats from a 3peat and the chiefs from a 3 peak
Brady > Mahomes and its not even remotely close
And Taylor Swift publishes her next ex-boyfriend song in 3... 2... 1...
The Eagles beat the Packers so it is good that they won the Superbowl.
See the difference ? When reffs domt help them ? The chiefs didnt deserve yo be in the superbowl full stop !!!!
"Beat Brady, beat Mahomes.....Eagles out here doing God's work"
That shovel pass be mahons was sooooooo off side. Looking like the NBA out here
Kenny picket with that ring
NFL finally put in real refs
Screaming Eagles 101 !
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Tampa Bay exposed Mahomes' weakness in SB LV & the Eagles applied the methods well here to get the same result
Chiefs without the refs = interceptions = losing = cry baby pat
15:47 Love it
"The Eagles was just a better team, and they should get the chip! Period!"
Elliott was perfect in the game kicking.
the game was decided at the line of scrimmage on both sides......total domination!
Go Green!
"Over rated Cheifs never belonged in this game , this is what happens when the refs don't favor the Mahomes."
OPI on Aj very first drive I thought ohh here we go again smh Fly eagles fly
"The envy, jealousy and bitterness shown in these comments is extraordinary. There is such a thing as being 'good winners.' It's not about Philadelphia winning, it's about Kansas losing. The Eagles lack any kind of class and they got so many questionable calls. Referees, umpires clearly buying new SUVs next week."
"Best Super Bowl ever, thank goodness the eagles won, I wouldve quit watching football if the chiefs got a three-peat."
Chief gotta work on their defense
"in the style of the indian chant: ""noooooooo 3 peaaaaaaaaaaaat............ foooooor the chieeeeeeeeeeefs"""
Eine Demtigung des kompletten KC Chiefs Universums!
6 sacks 2 interpretations . Chiefs by 17 lost the game by 17 points. Seeing Jalun Hurts . First MVP priceless. SUPER WIN .
Eagles champion
By far the most boring game in the world. More commercials than action. What a waste of time.
Eagles are just a better team.
Best superbowl ever.
No points in the first half??the eagles defense line was awesome it reminds of the Tampa Bay defense who had mahomes scrambling for his life.
So glad the chefs and their refs were exposed...FINALLY! Now on to BASEBALL SEASON!
"If Mahomes had Allstate instead of State Farm, he would be protected from more sacks like that..."
Dats how u beat da chiefs go after Mahomes all da time
The Eagles 11 beat the Chiefs 17. Even the refs couldn't help the Cheats.
Ref help KC on that 3qtr 3rd and 6yard forward pass
Absolute massacre
THE AGE OF THE CHEIFS HAS ENDED!!!!!
What a big difference when the refs can't help you. Congrats Eagles....
The Eagles D & O line controlled the entire game from beginning to end.
"I don't like this sport, no art, just brute force"
I knew the Eagles DL was going to be a problem. But wow they manhandled the Chiefs. They never allowed Mahomes to show up.
"Way, way, too easy. Phillies are next!"
"Congrats Eagles. As a Giants fan, are we still sure that trading Barkley was a good idea?"
"Eagles put the foot on the gas, never looked back to see who they were playing lol. Finally the Chiefs are humbled by in your face football"
Low-key MVP is Vic Fangio and the Birds' Defense - Williams with the strip sack and fumble recovery; Dejean with the pick-6. Phenomenal effort!
Thank God the eagles showed up & showed out!!
The Eagles were smart to not let the game be close enough for the Chiefs to win on. a disputed call in the fourth quarter.
"This reminds me of the beating chiefs got from Tampa bay, even though they only scored three field goals"
Mahomes played like he was as drunk as his daddy.
"No disrespect to Hurts, but the Philly D should've won Superbowl MVP honors."
The NFL is so fake and scripted its scary
"Kendrick Lamar was on the pitch longer than any of these 'athletes'. run 50yrds, take a 5 min breather catch your breath and do it again a couple more times. and don't get me started on celebrating every play like you just achieved something great, one guy towards the end 'recovered' an onside kick (whatever that is) and ran off skipping and celebrating, he literally stood still and caught a ball. this is why only 100m people watch this, more people watch the Tour de France............"
That 50 yard throw for the Eagles to make it 31-0 was brilliant
EAGLES STAND ON BUSINESS
Mahomes threw the game. Shaved points. Ive seen him all season not making mistakes like this here. Hes no rookie or new to the SB experience. This game was fixed. Watch the replays in slowmo youll see it.
Its so funny how every play takes 20 min. This is the way to watch the game .
Thanks @NFL
Another great victory of the Good against Evil
"1,500 in my pocket"
"The Birds did not blitz once. Let that sink in: The Birds rushed 4 the entire night, sacked Mahomes 6 times, and held him to the 2nd worst QBR in Super Bowl history."
Everyone talking this down on the chiefs because of this one lost they hoped to win for from first lost of the rigged nfl. Only gonna make us stronger. Eagle fans will forget this less than a month
"When they lost from Bucanners they blame de OL that was incomplete, in the reality the defensive team from Buccs destroy Mahomes, what they will say from yesteday the referee didnt give much yards for them, The Eagles Defensive team destroy Kansas City Offensive team and by far"
38 to 35 redemption for that Super Bowl 2022
How about them eagles
"Eagles, thank you for saving us from Taylor Switch."
Mahomes didnt know what hit him
The eagles defense should have gotten MVP
Chiefs a different team when the game is called fair. Pat a different QB when his line ain't allowed to hold all day THEY KNEW THE WORLD WAS WATCHING CLOSELY AND HAD TO CALL A FAIR GAME
"Stayed until 5am (GMT+1) to watch this. The Eagles defense was just unstoppable, they won this game."
"The Eagles got revenge, but the 49ers not yet"
The Philadelphia Eagles didnt use protection or practice safe sacks .
"The way the chiefs played, i think if the texans would of made it they would of played better then the chiefs, i thi k the chiefs expected to win . Please get better half time shows then theses rappers very poor half time show"
Philly brought they own refs.
An old-school score bug for an old school beat down.
Fixed
He hit that man straight in the face on the eagles sack play
As a Pats fan i now know the feeling of joy watching the leagues leading franchise go down in the superbowl lmfao
Way to get our lick back
"Wow. Amazing.The American Eagle Defense Wasn in donkey Kong Mood tonight .Scripted From upstairs For Tom Brady //oops / Patrick mahomes 10th 4th Quarter Come back _ Kansas was stuck on Stupid.. without the referees help. They had the field goal kicker playing linebacker.. Without the shenanigans.. The Eagles defense ""Shredded the chifs.;"
Should have been the Bills instead of the Refs... I mean Chefs... I mean Chiefs...
To The Eagles D fence.. Thank You.
Beautifulllllll defense by the Eagles! They won the game! GGs eagles thank god Mahomes didnt get a 3 piece!
cry kelce just cry.
Even with the Refs help the Chiefs still lost
Philadelphia flies like an eagle. Finally A kansas city chiefs game without help from the refs. See what happens when you don't get all the help you need to win a game !!!!!!
Hurts did a good job. Mistakes were made by him however. The true MVP of that game was the Eagles defense. Five sacks against Mahomes is insane.
I can't stand the though of Swift's ego if Chiefs won!!!
I can't believe people take so much of their time watching this.
Good game. Fair and squared
Kc got shut down
As a pats fan thank you Philly
for a moment it looked like Mahomes directly passed the ball to Philadelphia but who would do such a thing ?
I DO NOT WANNA HEAR THIS BRADY VS MAHOMES EVER AGAIN BECAUSE WHAT I SAW LAST NIGHT LETS ME KNOW MY BOY BRADY STILL REIGNS SUPREME EVEN WHEN BRADY LOST HE HAD 506 YARDS AGAINST THE EAGLES
Was rooting for Eagles
"#35 Watson, DB for KC is getting cut this off-season. Dude got torched on every deep ball. Gave up multiple TDs. Dude was burnt toast!"
"Even with the chiefs plot armor and dark magic, it was not enough to defeat the eagles defense."
Eagles
"Proud Australian NFL fan here. UP JORDAN MAILATA, has to be one of the first aussies to win a Super Bowl"
So happy to see the grest mohomo lose
I don't watch this sport just watched last minutes of highlights..congrats to the green team anyway.
The Eagles dismantled the Chiefs. What a beautiful day to be an Eagles Fan! Fly Eagles Fly!!!!
"Taylor Swift lost, lol."
Great game of throw ball.
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
"AJ brown really showed up yesterday with Davante. It was too obvious chiefs were gonna focus on barkley, they really stepped up."
"I know KC has bad defense. But on the biggest stage, not having a secure pocket just hurts. Terrible job by the supporting cast."
Great job Eagles! Kinda exposed the Chiefs.
Mahomes just got sacked again.
GOES TO SHOW KANSAS CHIEFS NOT ALL THAT! CHIEFS DYNASTY DENY! SHOULD'VE BEEN BILLS VS EAGLES! LOL.
They really didnt want eagles to win
"They must have watched the Brady/Tampa win against KC, the only way to stop them is to swarm Mahomes"
THERE REALLY IS A GOD
Mohomegohome
"Mahomes looking like a deer in headlights, scrambling for his life"
Eagles even let their backup QB have a moment :) nice
los chiets aplatadisimo...nunca vi algo asi...en los ultimos super bowl
"Great editing of all the great plays of the game. I'm in Europe so BIG THANKS. Fantastic job Eagles defense and offense. You really, really deserved this YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE WIN."
Played Philadelphia!
They tried early with that offensive P.I.
Defenses win championships!!
They tried to interfere at the start of the gamebit the eagles spanked them so bad the refs couldnt bail them out
im glad we can put the mahomes vs brady convo to bed now cause tom would never especially on the biggest stage
To many people bet there money on the chiefs winning the Super Bowl thats why they got blown out. They didnt wanna give millions of people big paychecks. Its all about money. RIGD
"Without the Refs, the Chiefs are average..."
Why is the audio so bad?
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
How come its so hard too understand refs are humans and dont have the angles and views we do from a screen??
"Eagles did what they needed, they so undeniably crushed KC that no amount of unbalanced ref work would have been enough"
That pick six was definitely a good birthday present.
This Game was proof the Chiefs did Not deserve to be there. They were barely winning games all year WITH the refs handing them free possessions and first downs whenever they needed it.
The refs ARE corrupt
The NFC East has the most Super Bowl wins Cowboys - 5 Giants - 4 Commanders - 3 Eagles - 2 13 total wins
How come its so hard too understand refs are humans and dont have the angles and views we do from a screen??
The league knew theyd lose money if they followed through on the rig
GO BIRDS
Is this when if your team didnt win you start crying about the refs cheating and the outcome being predetermined? Asking for friends.
The Eagles were magnificent they shut down Mahomes brilliantly well deserved eagles Kansas have been found out
"As a lifelong Buffalo Bills fan, seeing the Chiefs get absolutely demolished made my heart so happy!"
The refs had no choice but to throw this game
Crazy when the refs arent helping u and we see the real chiefs
Too big to rig
This has to be THE stupidest sport on planet. Cricket is better than this.
"Yhe Eagles understood that you have to not allow kc to be close into the 4th quarter. So the refs won't be able to steal the game ftom them as so many other teams were victims. Lastly, it's great when everyone is playing."
So mr Swift got nothing again
We did bad but well be back next year I hope Mahomes is mad
The last time I checked Tom Brady was down 23 to nothing at halftime and they came back and won
"Thanks for the F-Shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the Boys."
not sure how democrats still watch this boring shiiii
If you look at it correctly the chiefs should not have been there in the 1st place. The refs help them win 2 playoff games this year.
Cry pat cry this time no rf to help you
What a blowout
What did you expect when the majority of fans said that they thought the NFL was favoring the chiefs
A little strange the light didn't disappear this time
"As a Ravens fan and person who likes looking at Jalen Hurts face, Im sooo happy the Eagles won."
As much as I despise Mahomes I feel a good humbling will be good for his career
"Ka kaw!! Eagles put on a Superbowl blowout. Never would have thought it would be this uneven.. Philly got that defense, and scored 40. Was over ten mins into the game."
Turned off game when buckwheats grandson started singing national anthem
bobs or vageeena?
"From a Texans fan, thank you Eagles!!"
This Super Bowl was a win win for Taylor Swift since shes a Eagles fan
Vegas Won. Everyone put their money on the Queefs
The Dejean pick was a fever dream. 1st NFL int. It's a pick 6. In the Superbowl. On his birthday. Cinema
Hand the trophy to the defense.
Chiefs played terrible
Mahomes was slackin this game and in my opinion I don't know if he will be quarterback next year... No offense just my opinion.
Ok can everyone please go back to hating us now that they stopped the 3-peat.
Cheifs played Mediocre all season. The only reason they got here was their fantastic defense. Their offense got exposed for how average it is. Credit to the eagles they read there offense like a book.
Eagles defence played stellar. They pressured Mahomes all game. And Jake Elliot had a good game as well.
Tom Brady ain't never had no performance like that in a super bowl
Go Birds! The only ones who were probably watching at the end were us Eagles fans!
Kc should have never been in the super bowl they cried the whole season for wins they been exposed this game and im glad they lost kc
Congrats Eagles
Reminds me of the Seahawks and Broncos blowout
The worst super bowl ever.
This was Eagles game from start to finish. Niff said. Congrats Philly.
NFL fan from Saudi Arabia ....thank you Eagles for destroying them. You made my night. Cheers
I loved watching the game this way. I didn't know the outcome & saw this first thing this morning.
Someone got paid real American dollars to make that UI for the scoreboard
Travis Kelce was useless haha
Them eagles was flying so high that the K.C defense couldn't see them
Yea. My eagle got them a super bowl who ever got the less penalties would win. Go eagle
andy reid looking like andy red by the end of this game
"Defense wins championships. The defense line for the Eagles, lights out."
Vaya hasta que por fin pararon a los Chiefs.
So that's what happens to the Chiefs if flags aren't thrown.
Mahomes sucked. Great day:)
So satisfying wow. Yes!
"I knew we were gonna whoop them chiefs man. This was our season. We were always the best team in the league, they just found out. FLY EAGLES FLY!"
This is the first Super Bowl Ive watched in a very long time. Man did Philadelphia put on a show. These men came with a one band one sound mindset. They were so in sync it was unbelievable. Hurts like he had a sixth sense out there. The offensive line protected him all night. And the defensive line suffocated Mahomes all night. These men deserved this. Really great game by the Eagles.
"I'm so happy for Jalen. I was really expecting a match up between him and Josh, these are clearly the 2 best QBs in the league. What a game he did. What passes he launched, what yards he ran. That's the best game for a QB during a SB ever. He was absolutley incredible. Congrats to him, to his defense teammates that destroyed the KC. I woud say that the game shows how the chiefs were overrated this year..."
Congrats to Philly for playing so good the refs couldn't affect the game so much.
Very satisfied that the cheating chiefs got embarrassed. They should've never made it to the playoffs. Period. Thank God it's over. Maybe next season will be worth watching again for any fan liking any team but chiefs
2024 Taylor loser lost again
7:08
"Mahomes career chapters: 2018-2021 - High-Flying, Tyreek Years (Ends with Burrow playoff loss) 2021-2024 - Post-Tyreek Almost 3-Peat (Ends with Eagles SB loss) 2025 - ? Next Chapter (TBD) Just keep moving forward Chiefs. Losses comes with competition. Onward and upwards."
A-whipping anyone?
Entertainment and the arts have gone downhill. Im glad the Eagles won coming from a Saints fan. Anyway I barely watched the game. The first half was boring it wasnt fun to watch. Support the arts because things are getting bad.
At least we shut down Saquon
NFL is rigged.
Kansas gets lucky to make it here
onesided match
"Question was Taylor Swift and Kelce moms at the game, it's funny how when the Chiefs are winning the camera man stay showing them celebrating, but not once did the camera man showed them celebrating that blowout , same thing that makes you laugh will make you cry..."
refs couldnt save em
world champions but play against themselves Americans are funny
Worst SB.
"The team with the best lines-both sides of the ball, dominated. The holy grail of football : being able to generate huge pass rush with only 4 guysallows the defense to cover with 7"
this game was over in the 3rd quarter eagles
"Hip Hop is hard to grasp BC it's not music...music, singing are such a biological part of the human experience. So much hip hop is the same beat, same inaudible sounds...yes, it's popular and I keep trying to ""get it"", but this halftime performance didn't inspire me at all...I am serious...anyone else feel the same? Eagles were amazing all round"
"Eagles Destroyed The Chefs, they Cooked the Chefs."
"Go Birds, we did it"
"As an Eagles fan I thought this game would be a lot closer and more interesting, after the 1st half the game was pretty much over. Cant wait to see them run it back next year ! I love this roster"
The reference couldnt control anymore to a Power House Train
"The refs started out with a terrible call, but the Eagles werent having it."
"The league is very weak at the moment, this game proved it. Only hard game for chiefs all year and they folded like deck chair's"
That scoreboard is the ugliest thing Ive ever seen
Awsome game
Another scripted Super Bowl....joke!
It's amazing how bad the Chiefs look when the refs aren't making phantom calls. Goodell got called out for his Swiftie shenanigans and had to call off the dogs to save face.
We all know defense wins CHPs. Brady called this game. He lost to the Giants because of defense.
"May this man never be compared to Tom brady again. Sit down, you ain't the guy."
Fr
Them refs trying to help lol
Did she talk to make to come back the cheese making him to come back?
All these adults talking as if the nfl isnt scripted sports entertainment
The NFL couldn't cheat for the cheifs because they were too many secret services inside the stadium watching the game
Did she talk to make to come back the cheese making him to come back?
now how is travis kelce going to propose to taylor shes going to make a song about him now
The Chiefs gravy train has ended
Was that Brady as an announcer?
Mahomes finally had to play real football without being babied way to go Philly
Wheres all the chiefs fans at? I thoroughly enjoyed that beatdown. Too bad phillys dline was hitting him with creampuffs. Woulda loved to see Mahomes leave the game with injury.
Im so happy for the Eagles and Philadelphia congratulations
"I am a certified Chiefs Hater. At the end of the 3rd quarter, I actually started feeling bad for them. That's how bad this Eagles beatdown was."
So there is a God !
Now let's go rewatch Hard Knocks Giants GM discussions :D :D
From all of America. Thank you Philadelphia.
Wheres all my real fans who watch the entire season
The ref with glasses is a G.
Dude that is a Temu ahh scoreboard. Last one was better
Put some respect on Hurts name Super Bowl champion.
So many flags that game
I'm still trying to process why KC Refs dipped on their team so badly in the final game?
"Congratulations to the NFL! You put on a wonderful Super Bowl! Great game, great half time show and loved all of the ads. You kept the focus where it should be. We got it."
The MVP should have gone to the whole defensive line
Even the officials could not beat the Eagles!
why the fortnite font lol
"Chiefs so slow, its like did they have a buffet before playing super bowl?.. hahaha"
"Thank you Eagles, from the rest of the world... and go to hell NFL, do not pass go, do not collect 200"
I was an eagles fam for one day
The Eagles knew what they had to do which was stopping Patrick Mahomes and they did just that. They controlled the game.
This was by far the worst Super Bowl Ive ever watched congrats to the eagles but the chiefs were sickening it was not even close nor entertaining
Jalen deserves this he actually worked so hard you could just tell
If you're happy that karma handled the Kansas City Refs I mean Chiefs let's gather here.
40-6 never forget. If you didnt watch the full game dont let these analysts lie to you and make it seem like it was closer than it was. Mahomes got EMBARRASSED on live TV 40-6
"The 2nd interception by Baun looked to me as if the ball hit the ground when he came down with both hands on the ball. I know it would not have mattered, but why did they not look at a replay to confirm it. Was Baun considered down by contact? 8:27 mark has the bottom of the football hitting the ground with Baun's fingers near the top and center. That pass should have been incomplete. He pulled it up really quick of course. lol!"
Anybody wanna meet up at the parade Im real close to Philly
"To my Chiefs family: If you have enough fist-fights, youre gonna lose some. Nothing to be ashamed about. Eagles did their homework and executed well. Chiefs almost 3-peated. Still amazing. Great job Eagles On to the next chapter."
We wanted the chiefs to lose but not by the refs flipping on them.. keep the same energy. Eagles could have won without the refs help
This is unfair.. why is there only 1 player in Chiefs.. Mahomes vs Eagles..
"Still rigged, chiefs should have NEVER made the superbowl. Hope the ratings were low, didn't watch it."
"The 2 Superbowls the Chiefs lost, they got smoked by the defenses. Bucs in SB 55 and now the Eagles in 59. Both defenses had similar plans just rush 4 take away everything else."
"NFL should be ashamed....dividing our country with a different national anthem?"" and halftime?""? what was it?? release day at the jail? gibberish with ???disgusting..shame.....shame"
"The Chiefs didn't deserve to be there, The NFL was forced to make the refs stand down, Trumped cheered Taylor booed, Mahomes sacked, throwing Interceptions and Kelcie shutdown. What a great night. The Chiefs lost bigger than Kamala. Here's Taylor's next breakup song."
Tom Brady criticizing the reffing was a breath of fresh air. Need more accountability like that.
Ngl this looked pretty unscripted
"sleet or , The are trained to GO!"
"I rarely watch super bowl games, but the last 2 that I watched was Super Bowl LII and LIX, both won by the Eagles!"
Weird what happens when the stripes stay out the game. Chiefs never stand a chance without their 12th player on the field coming through for them
"On behalf of all nfl fans that arent Kansas City fans, thank you Philly"
The reference couldnt control anymore to a Power House Train
Kelce is a big reason they lost this game. He wasnt open the entire game
"Can Football Fans please now stop the ridiculous conversation on which is the Greatest QB and player in their History.? Its the guy who called the game, not the guy who so called played last night. The worse performance I've ever seen by a QB ever..."
"So glad chiefs lost, sick of hearing about kelce&manholes, well done eagles"
"Eh whatever. Mahomes the goat, Andy the Goat. Easily racking up tons and tons more trophies. See yall next year. Nice win Eagles."
"Gotta give Barkley a lot of credit here. He didn't have an amazing game, but the KC defense was focused heavily on him, and that alone opened up the pass game for Philly big time. Just by playing he disrupted their defense and gave Jalen an opportunity to rise up, and Jalen certainly did. That and Philly's D absolutely dominated. Mahomes was running scared the entire night. Great game Philly! Fly!"
Eagles D was insane...wow.
I knew this game was going to be a blow out and that the Chiefs were not 3 peating
it aint easy to catch tom brady
"As a Bills fan, this is pure therapy!!! Bro got sacked three times in a rowsomeone check if hes playing Twister instead of football!"
"I am glad the Eagles won , should have been playing the Bills."
What the hell did I just watch?!?
I'm a chiefs fan and I'm so sad they lost
Shows that the Chiefs have been carried by the refs all year.
This was the worst gameplan Ive ever seen by Andy and Nagy. You run the ball a total of 3 times in the first half against a team known for their pass rush? You set Pat up for failure but then again Pat shouldve been audiblling to a run point. Horrible performance.
This game would have been so much better with the Bills or Ravens at the helm for the AFC. Chiefs didnt account for the refs in their cap room it looks like.
Eagles
KCUF Kc
Refs were fair for once
Proof that the Chiefs didn't belong in the Super Bowl. They should have lost that last game.
"man, this game really shows that the chiefs are nothing without the refs."
"When The World Needed Them The Most, The Eagles Won"
Im from Philadelphia... this is so Cool....
The GOAT debate can finally be put to rest. Don't ever compare Mahomes to Brady after this performance.
Lol! KC lost!! F Kansas City. F Mahoms.F Taylor Swift.
What happened to cheats?
Hurts > Mahomes
This is how the chiefs have played all year. Well the refs finally stopped bailing them out.
Threepeat this Mahomes!!! Glad the Eagles made him eat humble pie!!!!
Patrick Mahomes is the most overrated QB in NFL History. Imagine if 95% of the NFL QBs had the roster he has inherited for his career alongside his Hall of Fame head coach.
We have probably seen the last free Super Bowl on regular TV. Corporate greed. Will be on Prime or pay-per-view.
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
I'm just glad they held Kelce to a non existent role and didn't show taylor every other play because if it was the other way around? My goodness
That had to of been the worst halftime show that I've ever seen and the singing of the national anthem was disrespectful. But congrats to the eagles for a great game
Thank u eagles for beating the chiefs STL got our state back were the best STL forever screwed the Kansas City chiefs
"4:14 penalty, forward pass"
Loved the game. Hated everything leading up to the game. Including the kick off
We deff made Kansas City fried chickens haha boyeeeeeee
"As a Bronco fan, thanks Eagles, for humiliation of the Chiefs!"
Idk what was worse the chiefs performance or the scoreboard
haha the amount of people getting mad bc patrick mahomes isnt as good as they say he is
The Bills would have put up a better fight than Kansas City ever did. Kansas City didn't have the officiating giving them the advantages they had in their other playoff games
Congratulations Eagles fans and team there was some bad calls on BOTH sides the eagles played a much better game kinda glad they won lol
Maybe if they upgrade that terrible running back room theyll be better
"Philadelphia cheesesteak over Kansas City barbecue. God, that makes me hungry."
This morning someone said the Eagles Offensive line looked great . I said yeah everybodys looks better when the refs are actually calling blocks in the back. No Disrespect to Eagles just saying a lot of teams were better than the Chiefs but hey they needed to assure Taylor Swift was at the game.
"I'm not a Philly fan but I did root for them, so satisfying to see them expose the Chief's without the help of their referees"
Cool. Watched the whole SB in less than 20 minutes and didn't have to listen to Terry Bradshaw trying to be funny once.
Saquon shove have had at least one TD . This look for him to have more goal line TD s during the season
"As an Eagles fan, this was extremely fun to watch. Congrats to the Eagles & JALEN for getting his first ring! Well deserved"
Good no 3peat and for Stephen A and all those haters I guess Patrick never got a chance to surpass Joe Montana or be the goat. After all he still has four more super bowls to catch up with Tom Brady. My congratulations to the Eagles and their performance.
SO GLAD the chiefs dynasty is about to start going downhill. Their every year SB run is over
"Snoozfest. Obviously, nobody watches this plastic armor-wearing sport internationally with such performances."
That was a peaceful transfer of power
"Not much of a Sports Fan anymore but The Eagles have been doing their thing for along time. Congrats Philly, yall have an awesome team."
cheifs needa work now
Eagles D-line needs a raise. ASAP. They didnt even give mahomes time to run around in circles like he usually does
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
The best game of this sport summarize in 19mn nothing compares to real football
Ohhh this was the opener to the drake funeral I watched.
Mahomes just had himself a Lebron James esque performance in the championship game
NEVER compare Mahomes to Brady EVER AGAIN
Kc got embarressed. Mahomes sacked six times and two interceptions this might be the end for mahomes and kc
"It is ridiculously fact that Chiefs players didn't know what to do, they just walked around, no action, no desire, no passionate, no run, no mentality, no nothing. It was the worst Super Bowl game I watched so far. Congratulations Eagles!!!"
Lets gooooooooooooooooo
Im not a fan anymore because i realized mney talks and its not a decision on the best team..its what they want. Who they want to win. This isnt highschool. Its money and who can buy the team wanted. Just like when players get traded. Its not up to them. We kniw this.
"All the NPC with the same ""oooh the ref didnt help this time"" good lil sheeps"
Looks like the refs checks from USAID bounced so they let the players play and the chiefs didnt get the win given to them by the rigged NFL.
Bro beat the MVP to do this.?
SWIFT WITCHES LOST. AMERICAN EAGLES SOAR. GOD IS GREAT.
The refs finallly didnt ref bad
This was amazingly fake...the worst effort from the Illuminati
Brady is a terrible announcer.
"I'm a Redskins fan,great job Eagles"
It's so clear that Mahomes single-handedly beat the chiefs organisation and fanbase to make history with a three-peat. If he had been a kicker who missed a game winning FG he'd have received death threats etc. But a QB choking like that for nearly 4 quarters in the biggest SB in the chiefs history is EMBARASSING. A kicker choking is one possession at the end of games. Mahomes choked over nearly 60 mins and about 10-15 straight possessions. Like I said - EMBARASSING.
"So Mahomes stays in to make the score look less like a blowout. We watched, it was a blowout. Wouldn't the Chiefs be feeling even worse if he got an injury on that last drive that took next season away. It was a blowout Mahomes, give the backup a chance to say he played in a superbowl."
Mahomes should went with allstate instead of state farm. Then heda been in good hands and protected from mayhem like Philly. Also anyone think Reid gave the Ole fumblearooskie speech after those 2 sacks and a fumble?
This is what happens when the refs don't help the Chiefs
Fly Eagles Fly
E-A-G-L-E-S !! 24 - 0 at the half 40 - 6 at the end of the 3rd qt Total domination.
Great game! Love the two announcers! Great job Tom Brady!
Dawgles win.
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
Nick wright still gonna put pat on top of mahomes mountain
11:02 there is holding on the center
"Eagles were the best team allday. Congrats. Not surprised the eagles had the top offense and defence. They could win it again next season as well. Saquon is still there,smith, brown and they have those young studs on defense"
3-Peat all you saw was EAGLES defeat Chiefs 40 to 22 congratulations Philadelphia Eagles.
When the Eagles were up 24-0 it really put into persecptive how great the Pats 28-3 comeback was.
I voted for jalen hurts as the super bowl MVP
16:12 that would be 50 yards penalty just 2 weeks ago. What a relief
I don't know what is this i just watched
Ty Eagles for breaking the hearts of all Swifty fans... I mean Chiefs fans.
Lets goooooooooo I dont wanna hear no crying from chiefs fans
Who are you
BUNDLEROOSKI BUNDLEROOSKI B U N D L E R O O S K I!!!
Go Birds!!! E-A-G-L-E-S!!
I remember how Eagles fans complained when they drafted Hurts. I wonder if they admitted they were wrong.
Lmao....puro punche Patrick Mojn!
"This Lions fan is glad to see the snug Chiefs fans finally shush. Eagles fans and everyone other teams fans? We ate good last night!! I can only imagine how wild it was in Philly last night fr. Absolute revenge game win and well deserved! Also Cooper DeJean getting a pick 6 on his birthday and his team winning the Super Bowl, what a birthday present!"
"05:16 - First time the FOOT touches the BALL. ""Football"", smh Scam sport."
So satisfying on so many levels. But this lets me know how weak the competition is in the AFC.
If the panthers were in this game they atleast wouldve had a touchdown at halftime
I am now and forever an honorary Eagles fan! Fly Eagles Fly!
Too big to rig
Pick-6 on your 22nd birthday. What an incredible moment for the rookie.
the EAGLES soar high!
Fly eagles fly
if you saw the full Super Bowl you could see Taylor Swift cheering!
Congratulations Eagles fans. Enjoy it! We have one hell of a team and franchise at this time. We know theres been a lot of frustration over the years. But this group of young men came together and seized their moment. Go Men!
"I can tell that every non-chiefs fan are going to have an amazing offseason, especially the bills fans. All I can say that whoever that ref wastysm for not rigging this super bowl. Oh, and one more thing before I go have fun: THE NFL IS OFFICIALLY SAVED!!! TY PHILLY EAGLES FOR SAVING US ALL!!! FLY EAGLES!!! FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The eagles are the three peat killers
What the heck is Mah-crybaby doing at 13:52?
The not so interesting Superbowl I've ever seen. Just can't feel it
What happens when you are all of a sudden coached by Tubberville
Locked em down last night boys
W eagles
what a boring game both teams i could careless but boring game
Man I feel relieved. The Eagles got my respect as well. Thank you birds
Brady Would never
"Can't wait for the ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" episode"
Eagles gave the Chiefs the Bird Flu
Wouldn't that shovel pass on 3rd and 6 be a forward pass beyond the line of scrimmage?
"Lol, someone got served a big ol' piece of humble pie."
Thank you Eagles. It was an awesome game and felt like AMERICA finally won a battle. Great job.
Ive never in my life seen a worse drive than Sack Sack Pick 6
paint drying w/o the Poefolk
As a bengals fan this is hella relieving. The eagles saved the NFL. Very well deserved championship win.
It HURTS SO BAD! Just sitting here eating my KF chicken
See y do people have to say stupid things and let there team be champ's I'm a chiefs fan and also a OU quarterback fan so I'm happy either way go Jalen Hurts proud of ya Boomer sooner baby
Mahomes been blown out in 2/5 super bowls. Mahomes has 10TDs/7INTs in the big game. Brady was blown out in 0/10 and has 21TDS/6INTs. They arent even in the same conversation. Brady>>>>>kermit
AND MAHOMES IS SACKED AGAIN
And now the whole world sees that Patrick Maholmes is not the big superstar the world thought he was. And everyone now knows that he is completely overrated and overpaid. He just had tons of luck for years.
Disaster KC
Eagles got the Tom Brady Buccaneers blueprint Target Mahomes
"I tried watching it. But it was just not worth it. The Half-Time show is a joke, the game was another legendary . I'd rather watch Dave Volsky's games on You Tube, but he's gone, probably due to the NFL's greed and idiocy."
Congratulations to winners
The refs did a great job of keeping the Chiefs out of the endzone. It was obvious the NFL did not wanr a 3 peat champion.
What a great Superbowl that was!!! Offense wins games but defense wins championships!!! The Eagles clearly demonstrated this with their fantastic victory!!! FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
"What's football about this, isn't this hand throw catch and dive to ground"
Why didn't the Chiefs put Taylor Swift in? That dude got hands
EASY EAHLES CHAMP
"How many times was Mahomes sacked, incredible"
"This really reminded me of the 85' Bears defence, absolutely played lights out and it was truly a spectacle. Glad we didn't get the meteor after all"
Where are all the trashing talking KC fans? .
These guys are supposed to be the best what a joke
Why did they remove the End racism in the end zone?
Only 260k more live views from last year & 1.3 Million viewers checked out after halftime= EPIC FAIL!
"Congrats Eagles and keep in mind, come back to Brazil in Corinthians stadium to have luck and win super bowl again"
The whole giants organization should be fired immediately after this super bowl game.
That defensive front was giving mahomes hell
I personally wanna thank the refs for allowing this game to be fair. We want the integrity of the sport to be respected at all times. I hope next year all games are fairly called by the officials.
Thank you Giants
All i can say is the chiefs will never touch the patriots dynasty. At least the patriots had a close game with the eagles
At least the Chiefs stopped Saquon for the most part
"Should just be called ""super bowl eagles highlights"" because cheifs didn't do sht"
Vic Fangio working his Magic! We miss him in Chicago
Mahomes cant handle all that pressure congratulations to d line they the real mvp of the game
Philly's St Patrick's Day is gonna be wild
love it how eagles humiliate kc. mahomes got caged and sacked a lot especially 15:45
"Im not a fan but this was fun, watching from Kenya past 4 a.m, WaKenya mpo?"
"You know, Tom Brady is so happy goat status still intact"
The puppy bowl was more entertaining than the super bowl halftime show
Watching Mahomes get blown out was incredible.
HahahahaKC losers!
"Good job by Sirianni, after last years exit in the playoffs, it looked like he lost his team. To Super Bowl champs the next have to say hell of a coach."
Lets go
Chiefs still fear the Bengals.
eagles fans this is for you
What a dot to the ref 13:12
It was too big to rig.
They are Chiefs!! They will be back and stronger. Loosing a war is preparing stronger for another one. So its a win win.
"The Eagles Front 4 being able to humiliate the Kansas city chiefs time and time and time again they dont need to blitz when just 4 people are enough, WTF KC? Once people start looking to see if the refs are playing favs you guys completely utterly fold?"
Best team won by a country mile....Joss Allen should give the MVP award to the true Winner Jaylen Hurts
NFL news thank you so much for sharing The Super bowl highlights it looks like the eagles were hungry really really hungry for a win they did not beat two time champion Kansas chiefs they slaughtered them I guess the Kansas chiefs in order not to look bad to their fans and to the president of the United states they had to score a few touchdowns but in the end Kansas chiefs 22 eagles 40 and are now in the title of world Champions in the NFL For the record I would have loved to see the 49ers do what the eagles did In the Super bowl
Thank God we can stop this GOAT talk with kermit
Go EAGLES hohohohohohho
Not even the refs could save KC from this spanking.
Take that Taylor Swift
All I gotta say they both played well but the eagles played like they wanted it more
Can we now put the whole Mahomes as the G.O.A.T. thing to rest? Will Taylor's Tool finally go away?
Refuse any presidential invites.
16:11 Thank you Jalen Carter
The eagles line won that game for sure. Just like Alabama all huge giant linemen
The Liberal N.F-FAIL!
"Mahomes look like an average quarterback when the refs let the game actually play. By the way, not an eagle fan, but Im glad they won."
I wore my SUPER BOWL EAGLES last week hat I purchased when the Eagles won their previous Superbowl and was made fun of my coworkers and this morning (2/10/25) I am now wearing it with much PRIDE
"As an Eagles fan, I felt soo relaxed watching this game. The Chiefs never faced a defense that good."
Thank you NFL! Great to see these highlights on the opposite side of the planet.
No pay No play
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
that was prettyy one-sided match. GO EAGLES!!!
"Fans: The refs will help the Chiefs win Me: Yeah, but what happens if the Eagles are scoring and the Chiefs can't score..."
"Exciting game!! Hurts, defensive and powerful offense were all awesome!!! 2:46"
Man how I loved watching that pathetic look on Kelce's face
Why wasnt Hurts on the field to take the victory knee?
KC Sled Rock jinxed you by coming to the game . The failures of him rub off on you guys .
Chiefs blow!!! FREE PALESTINE
Why werent thier any chiefs highlights?
Bills got cheated so this is karma!
Cable Bill Too High Price.. Watching YouTube Skits ...
Its one game. Congratulations to Philly.
The NFL saw that Taylor Swift got booed so they told the deep state theyre not gonna rig the games for her anymore. Thats why the Chiefs lost.
Amazing what happens with unbiased refs
WTF WAS THE GAMEPLAN Props to Jalen Hurts Played an awesome game and dropped dimes beautiful passes
This games just shows no matter how good a QB you are if the defense is pressuring you and sacking you you aren't winning!
"WE are coming back next year! You just watch, we far from done, with this squad, there's no telling how many rings will fit on them fingers! Real Talk! Fly eagles Fly"
Super bowl it's so red
Watched this about 4x now and it's keeps getting better
Go Sports Birds!
"As a Broncos fan, I'm glad the Eagles won, Chiefs and Taylor Swift fans can go home and cry like a baby, and kiss their 3 peat goodbye"
Shout out to The Steve Miller Band- Fly like an Eagles'
You could hear all of Iowa cheering when Cooper Dejean made that pick 6 on his birthday.
"Play your game, beat up Mahomes, dont turnover the ball, dont worry about the refs. Do all those things and its a win. I say this all the time."
"like Saquon said ""How about those boys upfront"""
Mahomes still having flashbacks deeing that incoming Philly rush.
you can tell they told the refs enough with the bs. it was too obvious at this point.
Funny how Mahomes looks inferior without the REFS assistance
Brady is awful.
Eagles took blue print on Tampa Bay defence and destroyed Mahomes.Such a pleasure to watch.Anybody but Chiefs as Super Bowl winners.
The sacks went crazy
Felicitaciones guilas de Philladelphia
Eagles Dominated the chiefs
"The eagles took tampas gameplan , whats CRAZY the chiefs never scored a touchdown against Tampa , so congrats to the eagles BUT please put some respect on that 2021 TAMPA defense"
REDEMPTION FOR THE EAGLES HAS BEEN COMPLETED! Jalen Hurts played an absolutely flawless game in this one
6:02 What a block from Kelce 2 plays in a row
That D line was unbelievable tonight. The whole defense was really but that defensive line was just lights out. Chiefs got a first down on the first play of offense for them. They didn't pickup another one until almost the 4th quarter. Insane. I never thought Mahomes would get completely dominated like this.
It hurts
"Man shootout saquon barkley , carried this team . Good job eagles."
Respect to the eagles Im happy for hurts but i think this game was rigged come On now
I was totally wrong about the prediction of the Superbowl. I thought the coach was really cool. Heck I don't watch football just a guess.
crazy what happens when the refs call fair plays.
Chiefs didnt turn up play until the fourth quarter Eagles definitely deserved it
"Time to say bye to Travis kelce!! He is worthless whinny!!! Not need his stink egoism!! Taylor swift, you need to DUMP Travis. He not worth!"
"It was a clinic! The chiefs didnt get outside the 50 until mid point of 4th qtr. that tells you everything. Mahomes was literally playing for his life, that offensive line was ineffective and non existent. The chiefs defense kept them until it was 0-10 Eagles, after that the defense was out of breath and couldnt take it anymore and was tired as hell. The time of possession stat it was out of their minds. I felt for a moment the time of possession was like 30-7"
No redskins? No Indians? How can there be a team named chiefs or a car called Cherokee?
I'm normally an AFC guy but congrats to the Eagles. Unrelentless pass rush was probably one of the best I saw in a Superbowl. Awesome!
So many advertising than the super bowl especially humble song.
KC shouldn't have been in the Superbowl. They took a whipping. Game over in the first half
worthy and hopkins finna come back drilling sh*t
"Gotta love the ref complaining when chiefs win, then the refs not allowed to cheat claim when they lose."
"Beautiful defense as a Ravens fan, fly eagles FLY! Congratulations"
So glad that Kansas City did not win.Congrats philly
"NFL with that ""the villain finally loses"" script....well done!"
I hear Taylor cryin
The chiefs sold big time bro.
"Pay Vic Fangio, Defensive Coordinator, anything he wants!"
"Those sacks on Mahomes were SO GENTLE... Eagles adapted to the ""HOW DARE YOU TACKLE MY LITTLE SISTER"" ref mentality."
The Defense was unbelievable last night. Im super hungry for a Cheesesteak
"As a bills fan, this is the second best thing that could have happened"
"In the first Eagles goal kick at the 43 yard, why the Eagles got 5 yeard penalty since the Chiefs players are the ones that moved first?"
"So the Chiefs played exactly like they did against the Bills and suddenly flags are flying for holding? Interesting..... it's like those flags should have been flying all season or something, but weren't until the entire nation and some media folks called thw refs out."
"Anyone who believed the Chiefs were going to win dont know how sport betting works. I never thought the Chiefs were going to win. They won two years in a row. Do you know how much money would be made if the Eagles beat them in a blowout? Sports is rigged. Im no Eagles fan. Im no Chiefs fan. Im a sports better. Anyone who was betting on the Chiefs to win I feel sorry for them. I mean, you think Mahomes forgot how to pass overnight. The Chiefs had no running yards in the first half come on now. If you want to be a sincere sports watcher, go watch college sports at least you have a better chance of knowing the games arent rigged."
Fly eagles fly yessir
"Got some good news for anyone that may come across this John 3:16 Says, for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Yahshua is King yall. We living in the last days"
The only thing that sucked about the Super Bowl was horrendous half time show. That was so talentless and stupid.
Two of KCs TDs were gifts. Philly knew they won at that point. This was the most dominating Superbowl win we could have hoped for.
14:07 sooo were just gonna ignore that he was completely over the line of scrimmage??
Our CHIEFS O-LINE was horridly exposed by that awesome Eagles front 4..its all good..back to fixing the team..congrats to the Eagles..so happy for Siriani..he was a good offensive coach for KC back in the day..he and the team deserve it..go Chiefs Kingdom and Fly Eagles Fly
"Don't ruin this moment, by having the mayor spell ""Eagles"""
The chiefs cheated their way here and score a touchdown until the 3rd quarter shows how carried they were
Bro they didnt just get beat they got handled in every play in every form mentally and physically eagles were and are the best team!
"Lmao, is this the same Mahomes that was being compared to Tom Brady??"
Whats the chances that the NFL ever figures out a playoff format that puts the two best teams in the league in the Super Bowl? Super Bowl games more often than not are horrible games.
As a Bills fan I was upset we didn't make it to the SB but want to extend massive congrats to the Eagles. Fully deserved that SB win after beating down the chiefs like that. I highly doubt we would've been able to beat them....but I'd like to think we would've put up a better fight than the chiefs did at least LOL.
cooooooopppppeeeeerrrrrr deeeeeeeaaaaaajjjjjjjeeeeeeaaaaaannnnn
Nfl knew they were being watched so they couldn't help them past the first 4th down PI bs call.
I'm not an eagles or chiefs fan but it was so low class to boo Taylor Swift. Very low class but typical of Phila.
Would have been nice to see the Leading NFL rushing running back in yards have a break out game in the Super Bowl but he was contained too much.
"Never Never say we are the Underdog is again Best team in the NFL Best defense, best in offense simply best in the fly Eagles fly"
E-A-G-L-E-S. Eagles!
"14:12 Illegal forward pass, Chiefs bias even down this much lol (yes I went and looked back, the real line is actually behind the blue by an inch or two)"
I called the Eagles defense the Philadelphia Bulldogs because they came the UGA
NFL I just wanna say thank you for not scripting this Super Bowl
Remember when everyone tried to act like the Bills vs Chiefs was the real super bowl? Turns out the AFC was the weak conference
Cooper dejean with a pick six in the superbowl his rookie year on his birthday is something special. That kid is something else cornerback and punt returner is crazy work
"Yeaahh. That Houdini stuff shouldnt be your bread, and butter. You came into the league, and confused defensees with it, but now that's over. Like an article I read a while back. Have they figured Mahones out? My answer is yes. I was thinking they can't protect him. He needs a line. And they were winning with it. On the edge of your seat type victories. But this time it came back to hung them, in the biggest game!!! Mahone it's time to perfect your passing game. Your legs won't win like the Chiefs need. Huh only 3 losses, yeah the Superbowl. Mahones was scrambling, and running, scrambling, and running. Probably reflex now from his weak line, but still an awful reflex. Sometimes running the scenic way in the city. Just to be brought down yards behind scrimmage. Sure he's the best scrambling quarterback. But Zi think going forward from now. He will not be able to win enough with this play. How many sacs y'all? And the defenses know pressure Mahones, and look for the pick. As Mahones oh no stairs down his receivers!!!!! And their the only place we're he can go, because his legs put him almost at the sideline on the bench!!!!! His first td throw, across his body, a tough throw, emphasis on tough,and needless complicated. And how many picks from the same throw that night. Alright, and you got his long ball td. Ok, out the shot gun, poised really look no scrambling. A perfect pocket pass. Pocket passer, pocket passer, pockeeet. No Houdini stuff, just text book efficiency. Yeah sure Philly had the game one already celebrating the Superbowl. And was relax on the d. But still not the success. No tucking and having to improve the best to do it. Out of a deficiency, now it's getting sloppy desperate, and predictable. You need a line. Front office he needs a line. It's time, and coach tie his legs to A dog runner saying no more. Your restricted. 3 yards east, and west , south. Hay if their coming plant the ball in your stomach go down with it, and come up with it for the next down. Please protect the ball, and come back up with it. Your receiving core. Not talented enough. You need more weapons. Someone showed a little promise, but more reliable deadly weapons. Philly has theirs, and they are reliable, and consistent. And earned their money on this one. All for tds. Ok recap, line pocket poised, better receivers. Line, pocket poised, better receivers. He needs more time. He needs to stop the urge to take off every down,and trying to extend, and make something happen. Sometimes it's just not there. Throw the ball away. And don't got saved, 30 yards back. Time for fundamentals. And your receivers have to be able to stretch the field, and be able to consistently make the big time catches, and not just the short chain moving ones. That gave you y'all excruciating success in the regular season."
FLY EAGLES FLY!!! LETS GO!!
"Brady has been a decent commentator but between the lopsided score and hearing him call mahomes ""patrick"" every 2 minutes I had to turn it off"
As a Broncos fan it's the best Sunday night viewing I've had in yonks!
"Didn't see this coming. If I didn't know better I would have sworn that the Chiefs went out in the Eagles uniforms, and the Eagles went out in the Chiefs. Hats off to the Eagles. Their game plan was near perfect."
Travis Kelce legacy game
"As an Eagles fan, Im so happy that its a blowout"
brilliant interception from cooper dejean
Mopped em
It was incredibly annoying to hear the guys in the booth complaining about the refs. The previous games this playoff run have set a bad precedent for announcers whining and causing more controversy than there should be.
9:10 the eagles coach looks like a Walmart Aaron Rodgers
THANK YOU EAGLES. THANK YOU
"Give the Eagles defense, the MVP! They were absolutely amazing!"
"Didnt expect it but man Im happy for them congratulations Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, AJ Brown and the entire Eagles team. Super Bowl Champions once again Fly Eagles Fly!"
Mahomes still stressed luka move to lakers
Brady went to 10 SBs and was never blown out. Patty Mahomes has now been blown out twice. Xoxo from Boston.
I dont even watch Nfl and loved that red & white team lose . Philadelphia played good .
"Didnt expect it but man Im happy for them congratulations Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, AJ Brown and the entire Eagles team. Super Bowl Champions once again Fly Eagles Fly!"
"I'm so glad the eagles won, the defence was incredible"
As a eagles fan and a chiefs hater best Super Bowl ever
Proved the football is a team play.
Let go eagles
Hopefully we get Black or White Helments with like Dark gray pants or black we just need some new flavas
"To all my chiefs fans, hows yalls three peat"
Chiefs had to prove the NFL was not rigging games for them.
Somebody better check on Chris Colinsworth
What I saw of the game it turned out like I was hopeing it did but the half time shows are a waste of time get some people who are real singers
"Can you believe it? All of those ""Touching Mahomes"" penalties they didn't call? Really surprised they didn't ""Brady rule"" that one fumble. After all, his arm was still going forward even after he was stripped of the ball. Just like Brady was. Guess they had a conversation with the refs about supporting the Cheaps instead of calling a fair game."
I miss football already
X & Rice finna go krazyy next year
Lets go the chiefs didnt win for a third time!
"Best loss of ever cannot stand. The Chiefs cannot stand what they stand for in their Hollywood elite loser status go back Cell insurance, sing songs, and blow your brother."
the most satisfying moment was when taylor was getting booed
"Well, this was a boring Super Bowl if you have ever seen one."
Patty Got COOKED real talk
"QB's of this NFL era, some GREAT some good, you decide: Hurts Mahomes Allen Jackson Washington's qb Rams qb Lions qb Texans qb Jordan Chargers qb Tampa's qb Burrow Purdy Bears qb Can't wait till next season. It's gonna be lit"
Imagine how it feels to be Chiefs fan and end up having your team caught with their pants down. God it's gonna be a great week. Ain't even an Eagles fan but thank you
Every team needs to watch this defensive tape on how to beat KC. Im so sick of these dudes. Thank You Eagles!!!
I figured the script writers for this game would have made it look more competitive
I can't believe the Eagle's are superbowl champions again in my lifetime. I am so happy.
YeA No MORE Chiefs NOW
"Fly eagles,. but one of the worst SB games I ever watched."
What was the Gatorade dump color?
A fun sport to watch. Thanks for posting.
Chiefs OL got more holes then a swiss chees
"TF is this game , like there is no structure or anything. It looks like a brawl has happened."
This felt just like the bucs vs chiefs superbowl. This shows how important it is to have a good o line
"I'm irish but I'm so happy the eagles wiped the floor with the chiefs, Gwan back to Kansas with you're tails between your legs, take Swift with use, hon the eagles yeah"
The best game ever nfl
Can you imagine the scenes if the Eagles were merciless and kept their starters out?
Philly's D was on another level. Thank you Eagles.-Signed Every NFL fanbase.
Chiefs offensive line was an issue all year... they finally ran into a D-line that could fully exploit it. The Eagles absolutely embarrassed them out there. Total domination.
Shout out the Eagles for allowing KC score a few points at the end there. That was nice of them
EAGLES R THE BEST BRO
Patrick D-riders quiet for the next 2 years
Bruh the deep TD passes by both guys were spectacular. Even tho i was heavily rooting against KC
I am glad the Eagles win
Refs fired next day
"Un grand partido, pero el show del intervalo, ha sido decepcionado"
this super bowl absolutely sucked.
The Eagles front 4 played lights out. Ive never seen such domination they were getting pressure 50% of the time with just rushing 4 the whole game
I sure ENJOYED watching Kansas get brakes beat out of them!!!! The better team WON! Congratulations Eagles!
"""This is my 1st time watching Super Bowl & I am not disappointed. Truly loved it. Don't know any name of any team. But truly a Great Sports"" that's what she said"
Never seen Mahone look normal like this
Finally no refs helping the chiefs. This was a real win
mahomes was getting bullied
Commanders did better job against
14:13 beyond the line of scrimmage?
"The Superbowl MVP in all honesty should have been the Eagles Defense especially the front 4 and Vic Fangio, just stellar play. Also, Jalen Hurts played well, they weren't letting Barkley get anything going and made them pay with opportune plays. Hopefully, Jalen receives the respect he deserves, man the disrespect was ridiculous, especially the ''geniuses'' who thought Tanner Mckee was a better QB based on a sample size whooping on the hapless Cowboys and lowly Giants. As a Philadelphia Eagles fan it was a pleasure to see this team journey from start to finish, they have a bright future with lots of young talent embedded in there."
13:03 hail mary
7:02 Is no one gonna talk about how Mahomes runs into his own player and gets sacked immediately after?
Love this game
8:28 As a European: Nice to see some goalkeeping in your version of football!
"Mark my words, this was the last time Cheifs get to the superbowl."
"Man this game just looked impossible for mahomes, he had the D-line in his face instantly every play so he cant throw the ball and can't really run just had to pray that at some point his O-line will actually defned him. One of the sacks hes literally getting him arm grabbed from behind by one guy while another guy is crashing into him from the front lol, what were the O-line doing"
"Getting owned by cooper dejean. Mahomes got completly owned by that defensive line. What a lesson that the eagles gave, made the chiefs look like a bunch of amateurs"
2nd interception from Mahomes sealed Chiefs fate. Eagles went up 24-0 at halftime. Could have been 17-3 or 17-7. I'll take it! E-A-G-L-E-S...EAGLES
Three interceptions that soon ended up in touchdowns. Mahome was playing for the Eagles.
We didnt blitz until the last quarter....LET THAT SINK IN
40 - 6 was the final score for the starters. Mahomes just selfishly padding his all-time Super Bowl stats with a 16 - 0 victory against the Eagles practice squad in under 3 min when it was really useless other than his personal stats.
"E.A.G.L.E.S EAGLES!!!! How TF aren't they ""America's team""?! They are LITERALLY Eagles.... Meh I'll take Super Bowl Champs over that though!!!! LFG BIRDS!!!!!"
"i thought that pass interference call at the start of the game was gonna be the trend for the whole game, glad it wasnt!"
Mahomes are gone
Why are they ain't showing Taylor Swift every TD?
No Dome Tonight
It's a fair game when you don't have the refs on your side..!!!
"The halftime show was doo doo. Should've been the weekend again or something. Anyway, I enjoyed watching the Chiefs get humble pie."
Congratulations eagles
seahawks next year
wow...soooo boooring
I didn't really cared who won. I just wanted to see a football game. That wasn't a game. The gangsters got to KC. LIKE KC IF YOU PLAY YOUR DEAD. SO THEY DIDN'T PLAY. WE'LL FIND IT OUT LATER. CAUSE THE EAGLES PLAYED NOBODY. KC NEVER SHOWED UP. SHOULD HAVE CALLED IN SICK. THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. SICK.
Patrick Mawhores
Ring chaser Hopkins gonna cry for a while
"Uuffff, vaya pana!!!"
I hate the Eagles and I hate the Chiefs but at least one of them got smashed!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations to the kids in Africa who will be celebrating new Cheifs Super Bowl gear
hahahahahahaahahaha *inhales* hahahahahahaha
The chiefs ran out of money to pay the refs
So satisfying watching the Queefs get beat up on! Fly Eagles Fly! Shows what the Chiefs are WITHOUT all the favorable ref calls.
CONGRATULATIONS JALEN AND THE EAGLES
Brady must be in love with Mahomes because he just keeps talking him up the whole time. I dont know if you notice Tom but the Eagles are ahead by 30 points.
Potencia ovoide en menos de lo que canta un gallo ovoide recorrer 8 metros.
Hurts and his Bama bros showed out. Fly eagles fly and roll tide roll
That Eagles D-line was absolutely devastating. What a win.
The Kansas city chokers
Kecle will just need to shake it off.
Exactly what happens when Refs are neutral
Makes you realize just how amazing getting 7 is.
Jogo equilibrado!! Uma hora o Eagles batia e na outra o Chiefs apanhava!
I watched the game on Tubi
"Esta vez si fueron cobradas todas las faltas que los referis les dejaban pasar en temporada regular, as que exhibieron y humillaron a KC. Esperaron demasiado.."
chiefs OLINE was getting DEMOLISHED!!!
Destruction domination wow
Smashed!!! Well done eagles
I just came here to understand what this is all about
"Defense wins games. If there was a definition for that, it has to be this game."
What a DENIAL of a 3-peat
FLY EAGLES FLY
Its almost as if the chiefs arent as good as they think they are
"Eagles D line was all gas, no brakes. As a chiefs hater, Im glad Patty was pressured, intercepted and sacked so much. Thats gotta hurt. Only guy more mad after this is probably Drake."
"KC Chiefs played yesterday? my Godness , The Eagles Defensive Lines come on, they should be recieve a Statue next to Rocky on Philly, well done eagles"
"Clearly the NFL is rigged NOW. Chiefs had no biz being there as they're BUMs. Mahomes FOLDED, different when zebras aren't scking your cck pzzy! The Lebron of the NFL."
"This was my first Superbowl as an American citizen. Thank you Eagles for making it so special!! Fly Eagles, Fly!"
"Thank for this @NFL. I could not watch the game live, so I really enjoyed seeing the major plays!"
Is it just me or what is this score board
This is the only way to watch NFL football.
"Vegas won big time by Travis held to no TD'S, SMH"
"As a Broncos fan, lets shed some light on that Eagles defense. I think they will go down as one of the best defenses ever."
putting Brady in the booth nearly ruined it for me
KC no ref help no party
This game proved any team even the Chiefs have bad games the defence and offence of the Eagles was BETTER then the Chiefs Eagles are Superbowl Champs..
Philadelphia did their homework this time.
The Eagles certainly proved what it takes to beat the Chiefs - Pressure Mahomes and keep him running for his life all night.
AND WERE BACK TO SWIFTIES LOOOOSINING IT !!!
Can Brady stop calling him Patrick
GREAT PASS DEFENSE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN TODAYS QB DRIVEN NFL. Never underestimate a great team defense. Defense can help win a championship as well
Kelce let them get to mahomes twice in a row
This is hard as a chiefs fan but eagles played better and they were the better team going in. Ggs eagles.
Eagles studies the Superbowl chiefs vs BUCS looks very similar of the shutdown defense
I said this beforeeagles cant keep it close if they want to win this game. Refs cant have a play when your up 34-0
"As a Chiefs fan, i am in complete awe of this Eagles team, they completely manhandled and massacred my puny Chiefs. This Eagles team really has the potential to take over the nfl for the next decade or so if they stay healthy. Well done, Congrats!"
Unnecessary roughness ? Thats an actual rule ???
Why do I hear Chris griffin when I listen to the commentator
fortnite scoreboard
As A NC panthers Fan this made me smile good win Eagles
"Not one Taylor Swift sighting in this production? The NFL needs a new ""Poster Boy""! Well deserved Eagles fans!"
STFD noobs
I dont want to see Tom Brady comparisons no more
All those sackings really hurtsd the chiefs well done eagles from a raven
So glad my prediction came true for this! Fly Eagles Fly!
"As a Washington fan, thanks for making the NFC EAST proud! And, the 40-6 whooping, takes some of the sting out of the NFC championship game."
the last super bowl i ever saw that was this one sided was bears in 85 vs patriots
Mahomes got sacked in this game than his whole career just like Justin Herbert
Mahomes was stressing that whole game meanwhile cool Jalen was just sitting there thinking about a pina colada
"What a horrible game. It started out horribly for the Chiefs and got worse as it went along. Before I knew it, the score was 17-0. I knew it was over at that point. When it went to 24-0, I turned the TV off. What a blow out."
GO BIRDSSS
YOUR WELCOME NFL FANS EAGLES FAN. GO BIRDS!!! E-A-G-L-E-S
It was a fluke
"Congratulations, Eagles. Your kicker also deserves respect. Chiefs intentionally false started every time Eagles kicked. Your kicker made every kicks!"
"The worst Football game I ever seen. Half time show, the worst. The Eagles didn't even play anybody. Cause KC NEVER SHOWED UP. THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED IN SICK. CAUSE THEY WERE NEVER THERE. THE EAGLES PLAYED A GHOST. I GUESS THE REAL SUPERBOWL. IS NEXT WEEK. CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. THE WHOLE SHOW SUCKED.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it SUCKED THE WHOLE SHOW."
That's what happens when you ref paper champions all the way to the Super Bowl.
"I'm sure Taylor Swift made it up to Kelce after the game. ""Don't worry baby, you're still with me!"" Is this American Football or an episode of Friday Night Lights? The Eagles winning the Superbowl is just perfect."
Tom Brady said in the interception play that Patrick was the best in the world? Are you kidding? He just threw an interception I wish everybody quit telling him how wonderful he is because he starting to believe it. I hope were done with the State Farm commercials.
"As a Chiefs fan, I gotta give Philly a lot of credit. They showed up and balled out, on both sides of the ball. And although I was disappointed with KC's performance, there's nothing wrong with a little bit of adversity. They'll come back better and stronger, I'm sure, but for now kudos to the Eagles!"
3peat this
Have the riots and looting started yet?
mahomes will be better than tb12
From someone who is not a cheifs nore eagles fan I have never seen a more scripted superbowl then this.
"As usual the comments section.did not disappoint. Expertly told by all Retired NFL player's, you guy's need go Rube one out.thank you Ladies.Now give the platform back to THE REAL EXPERTS."
"Good for Andy Reid, he can no longer complain ""third pointers don't count [2005]""; plus, he can claim handing over Eagles a Lombardi trophy."
The Eagles D line won this game. Congrats to The Philadelphia Eagles.
Did Mahome even turn up or the KC team? At all?
Chiefs play so many games each season and usually took the best shots from other teams. They ran out of steam and luck! Chiefs OL fail to give Mahomes time to throw. I almost put down the big bet for the Chiefs :)
Out scoring opponents 95-55 in the two biggest games of the year is the biggest statement ever.
EAGLES CHAMPS
The Eagles did what the Republicans did and made it too big to rig
The eagles defensive line was pushing the chiefs back at will and there was nothing the chiefs could do about it. Absolutely dominated and man handled them for the entire game. Back to back sacks twice and with no blitz. Unbelievable. That defensive line is the mvp.
Travis Kelce eating those words he put out about he wants to play on the eagles! Will you play them and you lost!
Announcers calling aj brown a speedster had me weak
"Been a fan of Eagles for over 25 years, this game was so refreshing where you got to see almost every player be highlighted, in defense and offence. They played their hearts out! Congratulations Champs !"
"They shouldnt even have been there. It should have been the bills. But Im glad the Eagles put the smack down on them, GO BIRDS!"
I expected a much more competitive game. But too much Hurts and Eagles defense for it to turn out any other way! The Pholadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions...AGAIN!!! Maybe my 49ers next season.
Fly eagles fly
The chiefs had no answers for sirianni and the dominant defense. No answer for fangio and kellen moore. No answer for jalen hurts
How is Taylor doing?
THE K.C. CHEATS FORGOT THEIR REF CHECK BOOK
Cheifs have a terrible offense line
Why did Taylor Swift leave at halftime? Did she not like the show or the score?
Thank you Eagles for destroying the 3 peat hype and dream.
Tubi and fox had shitty video quality.drive me nuts.and Brady annoyed TF out of me and I grew up a pats fan.somethin about his voice idk
chiefs let them win.
it was obvious the eagles went to play...the chiefs were there to party.....
Man I thought this game was gonna be hard for the eagles but we won!
Proud to be an Eagle Greetings from beautiful Philadelphia in Greece!!
"YOU COULD FEEL & SEE JUST HOW MUCH MORE THE PHILLY EAGLES WANTED THAT GREAT PERFORMANCES ALLOVER THE FIELD ESPECIALLY THE QB,DEFENCE & BROWN. WHAT A PERFECT PERFORMANCE FOR A SUPER BOWL. THE SCORE FLATTERED THE CHIEFS THEY GOT ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATED."
Brandon Graham Philly Legend!!!
Does anybody else get really strong Smokin' Joe Frazier energy from Jalen Hurts?
But this is the most boring SB ever.
Bro was a yard passed the line of scrimmage when he threw that shovel pass! WE AINT LETTING NOTHING SLIDE! Birds by a million
EXTREME FAN PRESSURE WAS FELT BY THE NFL COMMISSIONER NFL RIGGED AND CONTROLLED GAMES WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
What happened to Mahomes?
"*THE PHI EAGLES WERE AT THEIR BEST AND PLAYED TO WIN, WHICH IT WAS JUST THEIR TIME TO WIN A SUPER BOWL, GOOD FOR THE EAGLES, GREAT GAME, CONGRATS!!*"
GO BIRDS greetings from Roma
"... ... .. , !"
And to think they cheated the Bills out of a shot all for mahomes to do this lol
As a eagles fan I didnt expect this too happen
DEFENSE. WINS. CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I want to rubbed this one in Nick Wright's face so bad....
Happy for the Eagles congratulations and wow what a blowout
"We can say for now, Philadelphia really is the City of Brotherly Love after this reckoning"
Well it looks like the NFL told the referees we can't cheat again the fans won't put up with it eagles fly high
"I dont care what any delusional fan has to say, Jalen Hurts isnt a top 10 QB and he never will be."
Great defense by the eagles just like the 2020 Buccaneers did against Mahomes
Jalen Hurts played so good dude
"KC offensive line shouldn't not be paid for this game, cause they didn't show up."
"I enjoyed every second of this game, thank you Eagles for denying the Kansas City three-peat!"
1:14 the most ridiculous call
"Vic Fangio is the true MVP, his play calling to sell out against the run early and masking coverages was brilliant!"
I dont understand this sport
MVP JOSH SWEAT #19 with 2.5 Sacks Along with the rest of the Philly defense won that game.
"CMON REF, WE PAID YOU!!! WHERE'S THE YELLOW FLAGS HELPING KC"
Cry chefs cry
Tom Brady your legacy is secure as we all knew nobody can touch Tom Brady
"That toss to Kelce while Mahomes was running, Mahomes was past the line of scrimmage unless Im wrong- but alright lets count it"
That' s so great!
Defense win games just like Torque win races.
Congreso Eagles
"Turns out, so long as Brady is in the same building when a trophy is up for grabs, Mahomes can't do it. Poor guy, Brady's commentating contract is like 10 years long. Enjoy your 3 cause you ain't getting no more."
Refs missed hands to the QB face I dont hear you bitching! Eagles beat the Chiefs on the d-line and O- line. Thats the story.
nfl couldn't rig this one lmao
"So we're clear, I can't stand Philly...The City, The fans, in fact, the whole state of Pennsylvania Is A miserable place but I'm glad you won"
The Chiefs would be 4-13 this season if not for their paid cheating refs.
Kobe would be really happy now
This was the worst superbowl in a long time. Boring af.
Now that everyone is going to watch every call by the referees next year the Chiefs are done.
"As a Bengals fan, I cannot describe the joy that this brings me. Thank you Philly"
They got bad to Mahomes
Mahomes is mediocre when he can't get a free 5 yards to Kelce or run around in the backfield for 10 minutes. Eagles were on him!
8:00 everybody is what?
chiefs shut down Barkley
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO GO BIRDS! PHILADELPHIA EAGLES HAVE WON AND I KNEW IT!
"There won't be another opportunity for the Eagles to win for a while. Let them enjoy their last Superbowl win and have their parade lol. Fans of other teams hating on the Chiefs success and achievements breed haters! The Chiefs dynasty is still in the making regardless of this loss! The Eagles and most teams in the NFL don't even have half the success that the Chiefs have! There is no other franchise in the NFL like the Kansas City Chiefs! Chiefs Kingdom baby, all day everyday! Uh huh, y'all go enjoy this little win and keep talking crazy. The Chiefs will learn from this loss and come back better and stronger like they always do after a loss, especially after a superbowl loss. They will be back at the Superbowl next year!"
"Not that it is really important in the final result, but down 34-0 Mahomes did an illegal forward pass (he passed the line of scrimmage by ~6in), giving the Chiefs a 1st Down and leading to their first TD of the game. The point is that it should have been called, and they chose not to. Then the announcers just gloss past it as if they did not see it, or that it was even questionable. That is favoritism... it's cheating. That is part of why we (the US) are not fans of the Chiefs like we were 5years back. Same thing happened w/ Brady, getting the benefit of the doubt when No, that is against the rules. Enforce the rules, or don't... but be consistent."
15:45.. all time favorite chiefs highlight
The year of the mamba . Seems fitting.
Bottom line is that the referees had not helped the Chiefs get to where they are now the bills should have been in the super bowl and the Buffalo bills would have done a whole lot better
#1 WORTHY the only highlight for the Chiefs. Future star !
"Lots of scoring in the last 2 quarters. KC has too much hype, no actions when champion time. Kelce got only 1 catch. How is Kelce good? He looks slow on his feet compared to the other in the same position. Eagle players play like real champions. That why they won!"
"I was born 6 years before super bowl 1...I waited decades for the Birds to win a SB, Now I've seen two wins in the last decade...:)...The first one in 18 was the best...This one...meh...The game is a different game now... A lot of people in this city take wins and losses personally...Congrats Birds..."
Congrats eagles superbowl champs
Greatest defense from Philadelphia lead to Victory ! Congratulations !
Everyone pls dont ever say Mahomes is the greatest bc we just saw what hes like without a super team and against a very good team. He got babied in this game
Refs had no choice but to call a fair game. Good job Philly
The Chiefs dedicated their defense to Barkley and forgot about a great player named Jalen Hurst good job Jalen Hurst you are the man
Can the packers win next year please
Kelce sukt last nite i lost 35 dollars.
Very boring sport in the world At the same time it is an expensive game
As a Broncos fan I approve this scoreline
Imagine being crushed so bad that the team your facing decides they can throw the backups into the game and still win
"For once NFL and referees stop pushing up Chiefs for more Taylor Swift rating, and look what happens. :)))"
Hertz Donit.
Absolute drubbing.
"*PHILADELPHIA SURGICAL PRECISION* *KANSAS CITY, LIKE GIANTS/JETS*"
BEST GAME EVER MY EAGLE'S WIN THE SUPER BOWL OHHH. YEAHHHHHH BABY TOM BRADY MUST B HAPPY TO WHAT THIS AND LAUGHS ABOUT TT
Eagles Defence ate up Mahomes sheeesh
That pick 6 was definitely a good birthday gift.
"Im old, Ive seen it all. When the NYG Defensive Line beat on Brady holding him to 14 pts in 2007 SB, all the credit went to Eli for scoring 17 pts at 5.5 yards per attempt. When Jalen Hurts throws for 10 Yards per attempt, 3 TDs, runs for 70+ it's ""That Defensive Line really won the game."" Nobody said ""Brady earned this but Patriots were #1 in fewest points allowed this year."""
bro got sacked by his own teammate 7:04
Eagles stomped a mudhole in the Chiefs.... Actually had their backups in for the last three minutes. That never happens in the Superbowl.
Damm I knew I shouldve bet my rent money
Football should be seen as a highlight
This was the only way the Eagles were winning this game. Anything close would have been a Chiefs + Refs victory. It's a tough to make subtle (yet impactful) calls that change the momentum of the game when they are losing by 24.
The world turned upside down
Crazy seeing 2nd string the Superbowl mad flex on KC lol
That score bug is so ugly
And the best part is this squad aint going nowhere anytime soon (:
Best Super Bowl Rematch Ever! Eagles Won Big Time!
"Wow, the biggest game I ve ever seen. The Eagels fought so much and never gave up. Great. Greetings from Germany"
Gotta pay them refs if you're gonna play
"Congrats to the eagles , at this point we were just tired of winning, we were like please somebody beat us"
Mahomes reminded me that 5th inning of the World Series...
Lets goo eagles and mahomes is officially out of the goat conversation
ahhhh...The world just seems a little bit brighter today
The Kansas City cheats didn't have the help of the refs this time.
"Jalen Hurts has now outplayed Mahomes twice in the superbowl, congrats to one of the humblest guys out there go get another one!"
"After that phantom OPI on the first drive and all the talk leading into the game, the rest of it feels like justice."
Don't cry in front of the swifties chiefs
Even Brady would've had a hard time with that Eagles Defense!
poor Travis I knew I'd see that cry baby face the chiefs had no support in the crowd. They came out like they were somebody to boos.
Not a surprise at all!!!
Do people really enjoy this thing
This game was crazy
Cant blame penalties when your GOAT patty mahomes throws two picks and gets sacked 6 times
this would be boring if all the players were of european linage
"Honestly, interception and Touchdown by Cooper DeJean is the play of the game and the knock down. So satisfying"
I am so overjoyed i couldn't sleep GO........!!! BIRDS!
Eagles 40 vs Kansas City Chiefs 22/eagles 40 win a championship game!
Thanks Eagles for giving all of us the blue print for beating chiefs. Defense was absolutely wow. Superball worth watching!!.
Zebras didnt bail them out hahahha
Fly eagles fly
Time for some rule changes.... Bring back the contact tired of watching two hand touch football . If they do not change the rules start a new HOF for these 2025 players they dont need to be mentioned with the football players of yesterday that actually had to play contact football!!!
Footballs not rigged anymore gtfoh lol the chiefs played like Rodger told them before the game they werent gonna win. Then the refs were awful
Dem BROADSTREET BULLIES SHOWED UP!
"It's been a long, long time since I watched American football. I used to follow it during the 80s, and now that I watch it again it seems to me to be a completely different sport, even the way of making contact, blocking and tackling is very different. Before every game was like a gladiator fight, now it seems like a school game in the park."
all i can say is WOW...straight DESTRUCTION By Philly
The profecy
"Wheres the kelce fan boys at now I dont remember Gronk being so useless EVER during a Super Bowl. #washed Gronk > Kelce, not even close."
"I love how the eagles at the end were like, let's be merciful we already won. Classy"
Sounds like Brady's voice can't make the distance.
Chiefs must have thought this was a preseason game.
Kansas City got rejected from the Super Bowl goal line like one of Taylor Swift ex boyfriends songs
Go Birds!
Finally sb get it done
Copper Dejean is not a safety (KEEP IT GOING!)
The chiefs didn't play that bad on defense. The chiefs offense didn't play well at all. The eagles defense put on a great performance. Don't let the final score fool you. This game was never in doubt. It was 40-6 eagles deep into the 4th qtr
What a drubbing
"6 sacks without calling a blitz, that Eagles D line is incredible!"
This is rigged the birds should have one
"Patrick ""Sacked Again"" Mahomes"
Pure domination in all aspects of the game by the eagles
Congratulations to eagles Philadelphia championship
Kansas City gave Philadelphia the game no doubt about it
The tackling was amazing in this game reminded me of the nfl 10/15 years ago
Some of the flags called where terrible!!!
"The Philadelphia Refs, I had a feeling they were going to let them win after the plane crash."
The end of the Patrick State Farm commercials? I'm so tired of those.
"Congrats to the winners team Philadelphia Eagles , beautiful game"
I predicted we'd blow them out.
"Chiefs have been getting way too lucky this season, BALL DON'T LIE!"
Enough of the Red Bull Brady Had to mute the video because of the incessant motor mouthing of TB Omg... Truly shocked at how bad he really is at the gig
KC dident even try playing untill the 4th Eagles owned the hell out of the super bowl i bet there still partying in Philly
Anyone notice they stopped showing Taylor swift once the cheifs were getting blown out
Congratulations Philadelphia Eagles! U earned this victory and go enjoy this moment.
the kicker is good
Im sad but good job eagles
"Incroyable eagles bravo, et les chiefs, inexistant."
That 22 point was just a mercy point
Mahomos looking for refs help
As a Patriots fan I approve this message.
Brady still holds the GOAT title
Kenny Pickett must've loved the trade from the Steelers to now have a Super bowl ring
We finally seek revenge yesssssssssss im so glad we took the chiefs from a 3peat
Im so happy the chiefs got destroyed I was tired of Kermit Mahomes
Eagles defense dominated!!
Was the Eagles defense very good or was Mahomes very bad?
Tom Brady is so bad as an announcer. His voice is so broken from years of yelling
Tom Brady is the worst I've ever heard. He is terrible. Holy God he is bad
The Eagles took the Bucs playbook back when it was Brady vs Mahomes in that Super Bowl because this looked like the exact same game.
"props to the eagles D , they had Mahomes rattled from the start of the game and didnt let their foot off , hurts played good and didnt have any really bad turnovers,total eagle domination , im guessing the ratings for this Superbowl will be really bad , it was over at halftime"
"Never been to Philly but I see how passionate and tight that fan base is, super happy for yall!!! Sending love from your neighbors in Ohio"
God the cheafs sold so bad
Best feeling ever: the chiefs losing
"Philly has the makings of a great, dominant defense!!! CONGRATULATIONS EAGLES"
Che petenada... Phila defence won the game
20 mins ain't highlights anymore..
Im crying rn
Bla bla bla Cheefs
Its crazy what having 2 top recuevers and a top running back does for your offense. The cheifs looked bad all year and arent nearly as stacked as the eagles and ut showed.
"Congrats, Eagles! Incredibly dominant performance and an awesome team. Gonna be contenders for many years, if not repeat champions."
Bro I am so happy the chiefs lost because I am a browns fan and I am just sick of watching them win.
Just got off the phone with Hill he said yes
"Nick Sirianni is the Ryan Day of the NFL, a Great team is suppose to perform like this, stop playin."
Our D was the MVP!!! But there were and will still be a lot of doubters who owe Jalen a huge apology.
hated the eagles all my life but i couldn't help my self being satisfied
Funny how all the flags were for the Chiefs
"LET'S GO EAGLES! The sad, teary-eyed look on Patty's face was so funny!"
Anytime a game becomes a one sided blow out it gets boring fast i usually stop paying attention start eating more & flipping the channels to see what else is on. Agree ?
E A G L E S EAGLES!
i know alot of people that lost alot of money on this game
Not my
we really did it!!!!
Bart Starr is still the GOAT.
Eagles defensive line won it. Nice job guys
A beautiful 20 minutes of eagles highlights
"_""You can't leave it to the judges, you have to knock 'em out.""_ - ""Marvelous"" Marvin Hagler"
Hey chief fans cant blame the Refs yall got mopped all over the field completely embarrassing to watch Philly came to play yall didnt plain and simple
"Patriots fan, Philly, our very temporary friendship is over"
I almost feel like peace on earth was restored. Thanks Philly you guys are champs!
The most stupid sport ever!
Wow Kelce. Your relationship with Swift is now jeopardized.
"I think everyone in the USA says ""THANKS"" to the Eagles. Thank GOD, KC's run is over, go grab some bench, KC."
"*Youre welcome, NFL.*"
"Jalen MVP, but I think there's an argument for co-MVP the defense. The front four really were the key since it allowed the remainder of the defense to sit back."
Time is running out! 1-Corinthians-Chapter-15 1-4 Romans-Chapter-3 23-28 I hope to see you in heaven :)
THE MAHOMO ERA IS OVER
"WHEN MAHOMES and KELSE aren't protected species, they are absolutely useless. Maybe they should focus on their jobs and not think they mean anything to anybody in the real world and not a fake celebrity because they are dating someone whobesides teenage girls even cares about the giraffe faced thing. Congratulations eagles"
great match
"This was Tampa all over again, fun to watch. Brady never lost like this twice in a SuperBowl."
"Worst Super Bowl of all time, I passed out before half time"
Thank Gawd. Now we can see what happens when the Chiefs have to play on their own without the zebras. They never should have been in the SB.
Chiefs were strapped that whole game: Good work by the Eagles Defense
Mahomes the cry baby got what he deserved
Travis Kelce is overrated because gronk can block and catch
"America won, bye Swifties :)"
FLY EAGLES FLY
NFL IS BACK! YEAH LFG!!!
It's great that there are highlights like these in order not to spend 4 hours
Look who won Super Bowl 59. Sweet revenge! Just in case the Eagles had their dirty refs on the sidelines. Ok StateFarm focused on the Philadelphia Eagles.
"Finally, I now have two Super Bowl recaps I can watch proudly."
"The place First Amendment rights are taken away, let's hear the plebs justify their rights taken away."
Absolutely BRUTAL
"All those alpaca wearin KC fans be like,,, IT WAS A GOOD LOSS. Mahomes takin responsibilty for the picks. I didnt throw em. Did u?"
"As a Texans fan, THANK YOU PHILLY!!! this is what happens when a mediocre Team that cheats it's way through the season, faces a real team in a non biased game. This game would have been the Bills or the Texans vs. The Eagles. The Refs put the Chiefs in this game, they didn't put themselves. Cheating got them to the big game. This victory is so sweet. Mahomo is an Avg QB. he is so overrated."
Even by the tust Push one of the dline was offside
I mean I know who makes the BEST Philly Cheese steak in my VEGAS but I have to drive too far to get it.
"Never watched the NFL a day in my life. Here's what I saw as a complete newbie to Super Bowl. Mahomes was selling the bag. Tackled too many times. Worthy is the truth. Carried his whole team on his back. Hurts is very efficient, polar opposite of Mahomes. Though Mahomes actually improves when the odds are heavily stacked against him."
"SuperBowl 2023: Eagles Vs Chiefs After 2 quarters: Eagles ahead 24 - 14, Mahomes came back and won 38 - 35. Super Bowl 2025: 24 - 0 Eagles ahead after 2 quarters, then went on to score 16 more to 40 - (Chiefs) 22! No 3 peats for KC Chiefs...."
It was so satisfying to watch the Eagles straight up hulk SMASH the chiefs lmao.
this giving WWF vibes
The chiefs got a little reality check last night. Congrats to the Eagles
Chiefs got stomped on
Patricia must still be crying with the ref's
This game rigged lol chiefs had to lose this on purpose. If it wasnt obvious from the start lmaooo this is pure WWE!!!!
Man Vegas baited all them chiefs bandwagon riders and then took their money.
"WATCHING THE HIGHLIGHTS IS PAINFUL. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I WATCH A GAME AND TRIED TO GET INVOLVED. THE GAME STOPS AND STARTS EVERY 15 SECONDS. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A PLAY LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS? THIS IS WHY RUGBY IS BETTER - THIS SPORT WOULDN'T BE PLAYED AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE IT IS TOO STOP START, THE WORLD WOULD GET BORED QUICKLY WATCHING THIS."
"After that first pass interference call that wasn't a foul, I thought ""here we go again"", but then there was a make up call soon after that that also wasn't a foul and things were called fairly from there. Chiefs finally didn't have flags to help them win, and they got exposed for the mediocre team that they were this year. Congrats to the Eagles on a game really well played."
This game is just sooooooooo REFRESHING!
What happened the refs
Rugby
Congratulations from Brazil! The Eagles started the season by winning the Brazil game at Corinthians stadium and ended up winning the Super Bowl. Go Corinthians! Go Eagles!
Refs didnt show up
14:15 mahomes crossed the line of scrimmage like he always does.
Thank you Eagles for saving Football and thank you Jalen for denying Kermit 3pt.
1 min in and the hands to the face call even the announcers hate the cheifs
"ON BEHALF OF AMERICA, THANKS PHILLY EAGLES"
"No one saw this one coming, an absolute blowout won in the trenches."
You get demolished if your QB has a bad day
Wonder if Taylor swift was crying lol.
Thank you philly
The Eagles let them get those extra 16 mercy points
Eagles offense
Brady > Mahomes
Er body showed up on that eagles team
Chiefs shut down the Run. Hurts stepped up like a champion!
Bro Kansas City was cooked
"Im a Cowboys fan and i hope Jerry was watching tonight to see how a real organization is run, i hate the eagles but have to give them all the props in the world they've put together a team the league is gonna have to deal with for the next few years, you can tell how much everyone in the whole organization wanted this super bowl and they took it"
Barkley is the nicest
"I dislike the Eagles slightly less than the Chiefs, soyay, I guess?"
Love that the chiefs got smashed but also disappointed the got blown out . Boring game
I just wish that my favorite PHILLY CHEESE STEAK Place was closer to my Apartment.
Swift jinkz.....
I am sooo proud of my Eagles
Even Big Dom threw a nice block at the end.
well deserved win go eagle's
Mahomes should be investigated. He's holding the ball too long. Crazy Guy
"What is with the cringey celebrations from the players. Every player desperate for that instagram shot. Such a strange sport, really dont get it."
When The First Eagles Got The First Penalty They Said: Here We Go Again When The Chiefs Get A Penalty They Said: Bro Refs Your Supposed To Be Helping Us
We Tore Kansas City Up!!! Fly Eagles Fly
Kermit got beat up the way Josh Allen did during the AFC championship game!
Me after seeing the eagles win (I do not like Kansas city and the Eagles yet pick Eagles) do do too I'm loving it.
The score was 40-0 change my mind
No whats crazy is ppl still think this is actually sports that ppl will loose there life savings on one day the world will wake up I just tried to save so many ppl about this game I told them dont bet n if you do bet bet with Philly THE ONLY REASON THEY LOST WAS MONEY PLUS THEY WILL NEVER LET NO MIXED KID ARE BLACK KID SAY THEY BETTER THEN TOM BRADY HE GOT NINE RINGS TRUE BUT 3 BACK TO BACK HAS NEVER BEEN DONE Im on my wife page because we out the country but man one day the world will wake up and see they been playing on us
Only thing this game was missing was a TD for Barkley. Feels like Walter Payton not getting his Superbowl TD. Absolute blowout and yet tge most entertaining SB ive seen since the Pats beat the Falcons.
The world was waiting on the goat pat to lose some win there first and they happy.. I see whats it like now to be LeBron when he was on the east coast
"I have seen some pundits who got tired of picking Mahome pick him this year bcz they did not wnat to ""bet against Mahome"" LMAO"
6:34 first interception EVER pick 6 in a Super Bowl game thats
Deserved loss
That Jalen Carter sack on stafford means so much more now
NO intensity NO fire on the chiefs team
I'm a little disappointed I didn't get to see Taylor Sniff Dance Burn BABY Burn
So Mahomes didn't arrived? He was injured?
The NFL is COMPLETE
The throw at @13:25 was a beauty
Kc and refs wasn't on same page.... haha gone in
Now comes the breakup announcement....
When are Americans going to learn that all of their sports are rigged?
"At 14:12 Mahomes passes the line of scrimmage and then underthows the ball, and the Refs let it slide! Unless you can do that???? I'm not totally sure."
"Where are the Swifties, now??? All talk and no action, this is straight up karma."
Taylor swift doesnt like losers.so he will have to go
Whats a matter? Mahomes couldnt afford the refs cut this game?
I blame Taylor Swift for the chief's loss. The players were focused on her outfit.
phillyyyyyyyyy!!!
Basic
Kansas City Chiefs only show up in the 4Q.
ok TAYLOR SWIFT u can STOP showing up at gsmes thank u very much !!
Americans really dont know how to tackle you'd get battered at Rugby and you do
"next year, lions vs eagles."
Hated the graphics that FOX was using.
Wow...... This shows how bad the chiefs are without the refs
Scorebox is terrible
Eagles vs some high school team
"Under one day, go birds"
People need to look at PAt stats last 3 years he's been awful ... The guy is not good anymore sorry facts! most over rated QB ever!!!
"Not too many people gave these guys much of a chance. It was all about the Chiefs, it was all about their threepeat and their champagne was put on ice. The Birds came in and shattered every bottle! FLY EAGLES FLY!"
"I did not have any dog in this fight, but I am glad the Eagkes won. Personally I was tired of the Kansas City swagger and the endless exposure of Taylor Swift .It is always good to see a dynasty derailed. Next year may be a further changing of the guard with the Bills, Steelers, ravens, Broncos, Redskins and the Lions gearing up to take a shot at greatness."
Imagine you put so much money on the Chiefs and lost it.
Mahomes stunk
The number of times PM turned around after behind out the pocket was odd to see. Dont watch many chiefs game but it looked like hed go to scrambled then realize 'Oh im not allowed to do that'.
Justice display for the 49er fans from 2024
Congrats To The Philadelphia Eagles On Winning SUPERBOWL 59 Redemption!
I saw Mahomes looking for flags so much
"Andy Reed:""Sorry Refs, not paying you this time. I think we can win on our own."" ....."
Jalen hurts the GOAT
Notice Brady was cheering for Mahomes to make a miraculous comeback
"The Philadelphia Eagles are out here ending Dynasties. They ended Tom Brady, the Patriots Dynasty, and now the Kansas City Chiefs Dynasty."
I couldn't believe how poorly the Chiefs were playing on the night. I think the Chiefs have ridden their luck all season & finally unravelled in the Superbowl.
I can't wait for there next match
Way to Go Philly Finally a new Champion in the house
KC got too cocky
The media hyped up the three peat talk way too much before the game
mahomes team always folds in the superbowl and i love it
Hope ya all bought enough Taylor swift Chiefs merch. If not. Theyll up the prices for you gullible next year.
"The EAGLES had their HOT PANTS on!,,,,,WHAT?!!"
This was a no contest
I really dont care for either team but to see the chiefs lose in the biggest game of the year like that was pure bliss
No more refs on your side
Hurts is one of the most dynamic QBs in the league as his bama national championships proved so did his super bowl performance
I know Brady was weak lowkey. lol.
"I told yall Jalen Hurts is a beast dude is better than Tua in skill set... Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Tua, Josh Allen, Mac Jones those my top qb picks.. Mac Jones will be a good choice for the Dallas Cowboys"
The scoreboard bro
To see my team win two superbowls is badass. Love my Eagles
SeKCondary got bullied all night o line got little boyed from the first snap. We got our hat brought to us. Be baKC same time next year. Stamp that!
"The Off PI in the first drive was that moment where i thought yes, here we rigg again. Thanks Eagles, you crushed the tumor of the NFL!"
"""Mahomes is better than Brady, Mahomes is the goat."""
"Mahomes went missing for 3 quarters of that game, bit like Ronaldo R9 did in world cup final 98, Eagles destroyed the chiefs all over the pitch, faster, stronger and better all round, deservedly winning and showing everyone that if you stick it on KC and Patrick Mahomes they have no answer. And next year can we have a halftime show to remember instead of the shizzle that passed as entertainment last night!"
"Its one thing to lose, but to get slaughtered to that degree..we will remember this game for a while lol"
CHIEFS LOST AMERICA WON
Worst game
Complete domination. Eagles gave Chiefs those extra points in the last quarter. But don't let that distract you from what's important here. How does Taylor Swift who apparently was an Eagles fan before she met her boyfriend really feel about this? Speaking of boyfriends has anyone seen Travis? As the Super Bowl came around he was no where to be seen. Thankfully the Eagles won big. Hopefully that will halt the Chiefs Super Bowl adventures for the coming seasons.
Karma gets the Chiefs
All those cheifs fans where yall at not now.
Eagles defense is just too good.
Looks like even the Chiefs bet on Philly.
Remember the show recess? The chiefs are the Randall of the nfl. Everyone hates them haha
That shovel to Kelce was an illegal forward pass. He was clearly past the line of scrimmage.
The EAGLES KICKER is just THE BEST!!
"Andy broke our hearts too many times in Philly, for us to not get him back in the big one."
The pass interference at 1:30 of the video indicates how the refs were favoring KC
Saquon suffered for the Giants too long. He earned every ounce of this ring.
Go Birdsssss
Awesome the game was called correctly!!!! The Eagles offensive linemen are frightening!!!! WOW
Superflop. That's Soccer isn't it? The game where people carry an egg and wear shoulder pads.
That should satisfy all the conspiracy theory merchants. The best team won on the night.
Cooper DeJeans pick was sick Thats what he did his whole time at Iowa What a steal of a 2nd round pick
"Just me or was that a weird 4th down gamble by the winning team at the end? I can see wanting to keep the ball, but that was just giving points away, from my perspective, so why?"
"Man, Chiefs waited till superbowl to put their worst performance of this season."
0-2 SQUARE LETS GO!
@6:15 broke them chiefs
Glad to see the chiefs get their comin ups..get so tired of all the hype over mahomes..to link him with the all time greats like Brady and Montana is freaking stupid
Brrr brrr
Oval pass aimed at the head of the receiving attacker or oval pass at the height of arms extended vertically in the hands
As a bystander of this season I honestly have no idea what chiefs haters are talking about. I feel like the whole refs helping them out is just a bunch of cope from the chiefs beating their favorite team. Take off your tinfoil hat and just take the loss next season.
OUR Defensive line was Running CRAZY. I do think Mahomes Lower Back was hurting from the way he was moving though. lol
9:06 This guy looks like Mike Foligno's son
FLY EAGLES FLY! LOVE YOU PHILLY
What happened?
Respect for KC. Now Get Outta Heeya!
20 minutes of highlights was enough to make me glad I didn't bother watching this game live.
Brady called brown a speedster
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
"Hey there, I'm a Steelers fan. I want to say congratulations on yall big victory, you guys dominated the whole game, we cross town rivalries and I have much respect for you guys, impressive win eagals"
Eagles D line wreKCed shop. All other 31 teams better reinforce their o line.
Defense wins championships Thats how the patriots did it Well done defense
They could of completely made sure they didn't score if they wanted to
Brady should not be in the booth Hes horrible
Eagles sacks on Mahomes fed families
Finally mahomes not getting that 3 peat
"NFL, feel free to let football be football again, thanks. -Literally Everyone"
Just saying Would have been a lot more entertaining if it was Bills and Eagles
im tired of these terible halftime shows. the past 15 years they have been awful
Enfin un bon arbitrage
Da bomb put the nail in the coffin
Giants fan ( With Eagles Barkley T-shirt )congratulates Philly on an impressive victory. Old school fan always roots for the NFC. How satisfying to watch. What a power performancewhos going to beat this team? They do everything good.
KC Chiefs were KC CHEEKS
Shitties sport in the world
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Indeed, defense wins championship....."
How does anyone watch professional sports
My saints did better than the Chiefs did against the eagles
Well Done Eagles!
truth hurts but love hertz
Chiefs o line got demolished. Even the zebras cant even help them.
Worst halftime show ever
"Not an American football fan, what is the reason Mahomes was sacked so many times?"
"This is what happens when you let the refs help a mid QB all season to inflate their record, saving them from losing crucial moments. One of the worst SB of all time .. the chiefs did not belong in the SB....."
Beat down
Gotta remember that the NFL is in the entertainment business
3 in a row hahahahahahahahahaha
worst SUPER BOWL EVER !!!!! Mahomes has no fire inside him
Tom brady really enjoyed watching the game last night. Brady will always be the goat.
Why didnt the refs throw a 15 yd personal foul like usual every time Mahomes was sacked?
Chiefs ran out of lives last night.......3 peat what 3 peat??? pmsl
EAGLE FANS ARE LOW LIFE BOOERS. NO CLASS !!!!!!
Eagles defense went off
"Whats crazy is that KC fans got humbled, but Philly fans might now get big headed"
8:31 what an interception
Editor had enough of refs cheating and included those dubious decisions
And the cherry on top was a picture of fans giving the orange orangutan the middle finger
ITS OVER KANSAS CITY
As a saints fan get in eagles
OMFG! The refs actually called KC #74 for holding!!!! FINALLY!!! After all these YEARS OF HIM BLATANTLY HOLDING AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!! FINALLLLLLLLY!!!!
Its crazy how Chiefs get blown out and suddenly Taylor Swift doesnt exist lol
"I'm glad about the outcome, but I can say honestly say it for the first time. I didn't care who won. I wasn't excited for the game. I basically just waited for the score to come across my screen. Between all the referee stuff, all the betting on games, and players not giving there all for the sport, it's just not the same game I grew to love."
We're so philly proud of the Philadelphia Eagles!
The Chiefs were like an 8-6 team without referee assistance and this game showed it.
7:31 Isn't celebrating this at that moment of the game and making those gestures kinda weird considering the score ??
15 - 2...and.....14 - 3...oooeee..
SHUT DOWN D FENCE flyyyyy eaglesss flyyy
Yo I'm from KC and was hoping the eagles won I don't like Kelsey nor mahomes
"At the very beginning of the year I predicted that The Bills were going to win but I was wrong,SORRY VEGAS! Not that I'm a Bills fan. I'm just glad that The green team won because I wear a hunter green cool jacket in the winter."
Maybe all the Swifties will now stop watching this !! Sorry Mahomo hope you dont cry too much..
this game should have been the Lions vs Bills. but i am So Happy that the Eagles won
"Even though the chiefs lost I decided to jump on the bandwagon, because I know this isnt their last Super Bowl"
"have to admit i thought the chiefs won before the kickoff, so either it is legit or Vegas made the call that way too many bets have been placed on the the eagles to loose, but good game,imagine its your birthday and you are playing in the super bowl and you get a pick 6, awesome job #33 eagles"
From New Zealand know barely anything about nfl but watch the Super Bowl every year and Im So happy Philly won as I love its always sunny in Philadelphia tv show lol
Mahomes had a nightmare hahahahahaha. Thanks so much eagles. Everyone wanted u guys 2 win
Bye bye refs
"The chiefs should not be in the Super Bowl, the refs got them there and it shows."
"Just for the records, that that journey started at Corinthians Stadium."
"Yes ! Vince Papale, are you celebrating ?? The Kansas City Angel Reeses and Taylor Shifty Swift can't buy this one . Shifty, when is the divorce ? Is Shifty Schiff your papa ?"
Go birds fly eagles fly fly eagles fly
As a packers fan seeing the reffs totally rob greenbay from a win against. Philly im glad to say we the truth!!!
"13:04 ""The Dagger"""
"Brady commentating, feels so different"
Was that paul crewe playing qb for the chiefs? Didnt even look lile the same team. No effort anywhere to be seen
"Barkley is paid by the bookmakers, that or they have something on him. He purposely ran into traffic last night, had no intention of scoring. He's got form for it too, remember that slide! He would have been the biggest loser for the bookmakers that night too. You have no chance against them when sports can, and are, corrupted."
"false start on the snapper.. literally the person that has to move first.,. LOL, even the refs couldnt win this one for the chefs LOLOLOL"
So Happy to see the Cheats go down.
"Congratulations Eagles, great season ! Sng4Joy: Lo I am with you always th video on YouTube, Let God supply, What God has Prepared, Psalm 91 Praise Prayer song, Happy song of health, With Christ in Paradise, Carried by the Angels....."
Also Mr. Hurts congratulations you deserve it mvp... Cant wait to see my guys play next season
Dang they pack the confetti cannon in red and white it seems
"Eagles with strong defense,made them champions. They give no room for offence. Coach crafted whole game around defence n counter with offence. Congratulations Eagles new Superbowl champions"
"Pile drive, Sweat, young stud ,, the dancing, and the sacks. We are all going to Disney."
"What a fantastic win by the Eagles!! Their defence, offence, man they were just firing on all cylinders!! Super Bowl Champions!! So happy Jalen Hurts finally won the big one."
Why are there so many haters in the chat?
WoooW what a game Eagles did!!! They dindt gives any chance to Chiefs!!! Congrats Eagles supporters!
Great defenses win Super bowls
I stopped watching at halftime. Blowouts are no fun . Thanks Chiefs.
Ive been telling folks since week 1 its a eagles Nation
Terrible blow out game. Boring waste of time
"Was too big to rig in end . 40-6 against the eagles starters, talk about revenge and redemption for birds"
Defense line tight tight
"Immediately, the refs help the chiefs with the PI call on Brown. They're not even trying to hide it."
Come on godell yu think yu a god cuz yu got money huh.GODELLLLLL. america worships money and this game was given to the eagles.
"""Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles"""
"Announcers sure wanted Chiefs to win,terrible."
The kicker #4 was perfect
So boring
Chiefs only had 11 on the field for SB.
I truly feel that the backlash.The NFL was getting due to the chief favoritism.Reached a boiling point where it affecting the profit margin. So they actually called a fair game and without the ref's help the chiefs are quite pitiful.
It's the curse of the orange President. Way to go orange man
Wrong mvp and also it really took mahomes worst game just for eagles to win lol
"Eagles rocked! It was just not Pattys day. Sorry Taylor, the proposal will have to wait."
i think this camera angle is a little bit too close
Ese es el equipo k gan dos sper seguido eso es lo k pasa cuando no tienes la ayuda del rbitro y la liga de la NFL .
"Proving what everyone said about the NFL and the refs true ! The idiot or idiots who thought that by making refs hand games to the Chiefs to get them to the big game would bring in 12 and 14 year old girls, Swifties, into the stands and watching the games on TV, should be fired ! The refs/NFL handed those previous games to the KCC and last nights game proved that. The Chiefs had no business in that game and the score and the way they were out played also proves that as well !!! Not taking away anything from the Eagles, just saying the Chiefs had no business in that game. FIGHT, EAGLES FIGHT........ Everyone speculating if he was going to propose to her after the game if they won, are going to be wondering if she will now dump him and write a song about what a loser he and the Chiefs are....LMFAO !"
I think I speak for all of us when I say Id rather see a blowout than a fixed result. Real football is always best football.
Aaaaannd kenny pickett gets a super bowl ring!!
"Crazy how good that offensive line for the Eagles is..down 27-0 and Patrick ""turnover"" Mahommes acting like he's on dancing with the stars"
Longlive Kobe
Did I just see the first pick 6 by a white corner?
Such a boring sport
"Thank you NFL for making the refs be fair at least once in a Chiefs game which made Eagles win SB. scripted or not, I dont really care. it was a good show."
Much less than half of the country is gonna be miserable today.
I like Kendrick performance but can we get a ROCK BAND or COUNTRY music next super bowl!!!!!!! DAM some black folks like white misic tooo
Cheif just forgot to bring their o line
Most satisfying Super Bowl ever!
6:39 6:38 6:37
this was a seahawks - broncos level thrashing
Crazy how the eagles took the three-peat from the patriots and now chiefs
What a dissapointment of a superbowl. Hope both teams go through a decade long dry spell after this.
Pretty sure everything that went wrong with the Chiefs is Russell Wilsons fault
Hmmmm imagine that
O-line let down the chiefs
*_EVERYONE PICKEF THE REFS TO WIN_*
Worthy is nasty
I say the Chiefs outta trade Travis Kelce to the Cowboys
"We did it!! Fly Eagles Fly!! To all my fellow Eagles, LOVE YOUSE!!!!"
Jalen deserved that win!!!! good job MVP
"""THIS IS HOW WE HUNT!!!"""
"Glad Eagle won super bowl congrat,though Kansas would Super Bowl these year,properly do fantasy sport in 2026"
Have you guys watched the Fantastic Four First Steps teaser trailer?
They said mahomes was the best in the nfl
Such a boring sport
Me and the fam after halftime was just sitting there waiting for the game to end because we knew the eagles came to not play around this year GO BIRDSSSS
Less of Taylor and more of the good old football.
"Now you see when they don't have paid employees(NFL refs) the Cheaters I mean Chiefs are below average just like any other bottom dwelling team....!!! Patty cake Mahommo got that work by the defense of the Eagles and I'm so glad he finally was exposed...!!! Teams now have a blueprint on how to play and beat them thanks to the Eagles Congratulations Eagles!!!! I really wanted this for Jalen, AJ, Devonta and Shaquon"
Refs cheated for the eagles so on the first snap to make up for the controversy calls over the years smfh
You eagles deserve it
congrats johnny wilson
"Good game to the eagles, that defensive line was dominant and the eagles dominated all around. Now fix that o line chiefs To chiefs haters, the chiefs fans are somehow being better than yall in this loss, my friend whos a chiefs fan doenst taunt, nor whine, just wants the o line fix"
13:17 from the WOW to Eagle fans
"No commercials, surprised and thankful"
"Good game to the eagles, that defensive line was dominant and the eagles dominated all around. Now fix that o line chiefs To chiefs haters, the chiefs fans are somehow being better than yall in this loss, my friend whos a chiefs fan doenst taunt, nor whine, just wants the o line fix"
us sacking mahomes was as easy as a high five last night
When the other team is just simply better than you in all facets of the game...on paper and on the field!
It made my day to see the Kansas City Chiefs fall to the Eagles.
"Nick Foles takes down Brady (2018), Jalen Hurts takes down Mahomes (2025). Never been happier being from Philly"
"Wow, Philly's D resembled the 85 Bears out there. Congrats to Philly fans everywhere and THANK YOU for beating this KC team."
If these lot were to watch a rugby match they would be embarrassed what a boring sport
"so much braindead hate in these comments, just a american thing i guess. this win had nothing to do with the refs. this eagles team would have cooked everybody yesterday."
Philadelphia Eagles!
HOW BOUT THEM CHIEFS!!!!
Finally a game with no bogus flags
Its almost like the script for the longest yard.
I LOVE MY CITY BROAD ST WAS LIT
This is my 5th time watching these highlights tonight....lol
I don't even understand this type of hand ball
This clown mahommes is a made up fake Champion should never be in this game
"Happy for the eagles, but the game was a blowout, as a football fan i want to see a good game"
scripted. refs gave every call for kansas xD
this is what shows you that the chiefs were simply not supposed to be here. without the refs they wouldnt have made it this far
Wow. Hats off to the D line. Crushed it!
I have never been so happy than I was watching this game.
The cheats get embarrassed like they should of been all season. Just even more proof that the refs helped them get there
I knew after that 55 point game the Eagles were going to embarrass the Chiefs and they did .....
What sport is this? Why they playing football with hand?
"I dont watch football much. But always enjoy the Super Bowl. Being from Pennsylvania, eagles all the way. At one point I was actually feeling sorry for Mahomes and team. Great game..defense was amazing. Is he going to Disney?"
"Without the Refs, chiefs are not making it to the SB in any lifetime Congrats the Eagles"
Game reminded me of the Bucs-Chiefs Superbowl. Mahomes running for his life every play. That is how you dominate and win games. Upfront.
Im actually glad my Ravens didnt make it to this game as NO TEAM IN NFL would have beaten Philly today. That was what you call a serious beat down. Congratulations to Eagles on playing one great game.
"Happy, nay ecstatic in England, the one with the King not the New one."
"The lions gave the eagles a better game than the chiefs. No wonder the eagles are the champ,"
I just won 50 dollars lol thank you eagles
That eagles defensive line really crushed the opponents moral
Kevin Burkhardt can now shut the pie hole. Fly Eagles fly!!!!
that whole eagles front 4 defense need drug tested too juiced you dont go 4 quarters lights out like that against guys of similar or bigger size. and keep playing like that. call me a sore loser i dont care but that the first time i have seen such bogus.
Too big to rig
"FLY EAGLES FLY On the road to victory Fight, Fight, Fight Fight, Eagles, Fight Score a touchdown 1-2-3 1-2-3 Hit em low Hit em high And watch our Eagles fight Fly Eagles Fly On the road to victory E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!"
Even chiefs fans laughed at Mahomes
NEVER A DOUBT
Where is lebrwann james at
That satisfying hit @ 15:47
I've often wondered what necessary roughness would look like.
I've started watching wrestling it looks more real
I dont want to hear another word about a Mahomes being thr goat anymore.
Thanks Phila Eagles for revenging my Bills we owe you one
Exposing mahomes was the best Super Bowl so far. That kid is well below average skill
"I was worried about being tired today at work having to wake up at 4am. But thanks to Philly the game was over at halftime and after whatever you wanna call that halftime performance it was definitely over. I turned it off and went to bed. The NFL is turning the Super Bowl into the Grammys. This is football man, get someone to perform that gives us chills and actually gets the crowd popping. Im sorry but I thought that halftime performance was ranked up there with some of the worst. lil Wayne shoulda been the halftime show"
Crazy no roughing the passer calls on all those sacks all other games this season if you sneezed on mahomes you got roughing the passer
Its crazy how Kendrick beat drake someone whos been on top for so long and eagles beat chefs a team thats been on top for so long. Yall dont see the script?
Whole different game when the refs aren't involved !! GREAT JOB EAGELS. JALEN HURTS H-TOWN TEXAS PRODUCT!!!
The Chiefs O-line gets away with so much holding and yet they couldn't stop the Eagles!
"I remember my American guests being unable to concentrate on Tv in the UK as adverts are either infrequent or dont exist during programmes. Conversely I struggle with this ( and this is just highlights) as no passage of play lasts more than a few seconds. While the Chiefs looked barely interested, apart from Mahomes, the Eagles at least turned up and played. Im a rugby fan and always will be and completely understand why American football hasnt travelled well. No offence intended, just an opinion and a suggestion to watch some Rugby Union. The USA team is coming along nicely but try Ireland, France, NZ, England or world champs, South Africa."
Kansas City got what they deserved. Glad the Eaglea came into the gake prepared. Goes to show who wanted it more. Kansas City thought they were probably gonna get a easy win
Can someone explain the Super Bowl in Counter Strike terms?
Das ist LOLISSIMO
"Mahomes possibly the GOAT some say, no he looked more like a KID."
Its good to see a different winner for a change.
One of the worst superbowls in recent memory
Hahaha Kermit choked
I guess they gone get tyrek hill back lol might need him next year
Congrats Eagles! I not into football . It strange KC back to back champs! 0 touchdown entries third quarter .
The game was so terrible ... most terrible super bowl ever and perhaps for dekades. Congratulations to the Eagles! PS: The half time show was a grab in the toilet
Rekt
I can't believe how much I learned from this video! It's packed with valuable information and insights. I'm so grateful for your generosity in sharing your knowledge. This is a must-watch!
Hurts is now 4-0 in the Superdome
The chiefs were playing like they were expected more help.
congrats eagles you deserve it
So glad the refs actually did their job tonight!!! Congrats to the eagles on a well deserved win
"Thank you, @NFL, for your awesome youtube video highlights this season!"
"I'm so happy for Jake Elliott, the guy was struggling all season and in the super bowl he hits every extra point and field goal, he even got iced by the refs a couple times."
This team so good it felt like a pre season game. Didnt have a million heart attacks or strokes.
NO refs no party.
Dominant performance by the Eagles.
Mahomes is a very good player but rest of his team has not the same level. Eagles D line won this Super Bowl. (Sorry for my english cause Im french ! )
Anytime the chiefs lose America wins
Thank u tubi for doing the super bowl 59 game last night
"Buffalo Bills fan says ""Thank you"" to Philly and Jalen Hurts."
I wonder if Taylor Swift is going to write a song about this
Did anyone else besides me think Tom Brady sounded like a cartoon throughout the game?
Well to all the haters how about that eye test boys
"The Ghost of #8 ensured the Cheats don't steal another SuperBowl, Mamba Mentality"
"""Defense wins Championships"" Nico Harrison. #dallasmavericks #mavs #nba #doncic #anthonydavis"
"Didn't watch one minute of the game, but I can already tell 8 minutes into this highlight reel that this was a rather bad officiating effort......"" No, didn't like THAT one either"""
There are no fun this year Superbowl.
FLY EAGLESSS WE WONNN
Eagles were great but got to be one of the worst performances in a Super Bowl by the Chiefs
Saints fan here to congratulate philly on y'all big win
"Top 5 most boring super bowl I've watched and I've watched 30+. Without checking, I bet viewership dropped off significantly after the 2nd series in the 3rd quarter."
"Eagles fan here, so happy Kermit Mahommo got hit hard, and OMG what's Nick Wright gonna say now"
Mahomes loves getting hugged
Philly defense absolutely shut down the chiefs offense. Chiefs didnt start doing anything until Philly started letting back ups play. KC needs a playmaker on offense like a real #1 WR. Travis Kelce is good but he isnt that good. Shut him down and the chiefs cant do anything. Philly showed the recipe in shutting the chiefs offense down. An aging Hopkins isnt a true #1. I knew this game was gonna be a blowout. Its definitely up there with one of the worst super bowls Ive watched and I turned 40 yesterday.
terzo quarto la partita era gia finita
"Thank goodness we have the beautiful game here in England. Proper football (soccer). And a proper mans game, rugby!"
These boys playing with Mahomes
Mahomes is dreaming in all half time.
"Well that first down to kelcy, mahomes was past the line of skrimiage. But guess whennyour losing thst bad they dont call it."
What no Chiefs players celebrating last td n 2 point at end.
So much with the mahomes GOAT debate days ago. hihihi
The World is change even in sports like business and politics. No one can listen WOKE schedule any more
It was great seeing this fast replay of the entire game in record time without all of the halftime nonsense.
Bull texan Amigo woulda done the Same just somefukinhow oh didnt SEEEE got outGUNNED sfw still hella ver young still congrats Eagles
This kansas chiefs were put in this game by the league and tge refs but the true deserving team won at the End a bit of justice was restored
"Karma, all that bragging and trying to be a Hollywood star. Didn't have the eye of the tiger anymore. And Philly did and you got stomped ! Glad to see Philly brought back the Iron Curtain. The party's over call it a day."
Silver Linings Playbook. if i read the signs Eagles will blowout chiefs.
"Thank heavens! Now we will all be spared another off-season of the Swift-Kelce carnival. Hopefully, the blackout will extend into next season. As a Giants fan, I never thought I'd be so happy to see the Eagles win."
When you are expecting Mahomes and the Chiefs will go for a record but they failed. I thought that their loss to the Pirates is the worst game they had but this is much worse! Congrats to the Eagles!
I guess it is hard to win when the refs dont pitch in
Superbowl ?? Looks like an Eagles training afternoon to me ...
Everyone is overjoyed that the Chiefs lost. They finally got a taste of their own medicine. It's a great day.
Can someone say..whooping!
SIT
Eagles just bullied them with the defence the best d possibly in Super Bowl history
They got Mahomes looking like a rookie
"Its a beautiful day for America. Dems lost, chiefs lost, swift booed , Trumps back where he belongs, And the eagles bring home the Championship. God bless America."
It shouldve been josh allen and the bills getting that W
So happy for the Eagles
Eagles were like a merciless steamroller
This would have been more fun to watch if Bills were in instead
KC PLAYED A HORRIBLE GAME IT JUST WASNT THERE DAY .
"What kind of sport is this? How is this the most watched one in the usa, very interesting"
"Why do they call it football if they only kicked the ball with the foot like once in the entire game? And the ""ball"" is not even round. It looks more like an egg. This game should be called handegg or something like that."
Buc fan here only time I've ever pulled for the Philadelphia eagles from the City of brotherly crime
What the hell these people are doing?? Have no idea.
Congrats to Philly Im happy yall got it. D-line played lights out. Defense wins championships no denying it. Another factor on this one was fair officiating. Good calls were made in my opinion with minimal bias.
"Like always, amazing handball game with a little bit of kicking"
"Kenny Pickett has a ring, Let that sink in."
"Truth is the NFL fully intended to rig this game, but the people have spoken again, they told the refs to let em play, and you now see KC should have never gotten to the game in the first place. So even though it was satisfying to watch, that was NOT the deserving AFC side. IMO."
Is it not crazy when refs arent on your side?? What a dominating game.
"Whoo Hoo! The Chiefs finally got theirs; no three peat for yoouuu. I'm just so glad the Eagles were smart enough not to just run Barkley all night against the run blitz. Perk up Packers, it's always best to say you lost to the eventual champions."
"Chiefs Fan. Congratulations Philly. You earned it, deserved it. Enjoy."
This definitely reminded me of the Bucs demolishing Kansas City in their Super Bowl. Just complete dominance with defense
Bad day for KC But England beat France at Rugby That's Big
As a 9ers fan from the late 80s I've seen a lot of haters. This is a win win for me either way I'm proud of these brothers you cant take nothing from them.Their futures are very bright.
The Chiefs first TD might not have happened if the refs and/or the Eagles booth review had realized that Mahomes had already crossed the line of scrimmage before that flip pass to Kelce @14:10 in the video
The chiefs fans should act childish like the rest of yall and call the game rigged. They had to rigg it to beat the chiefs
Somebody check on Nick wright
MY LORD american football is silly .....
WTF is going on
This is what the chiefs get for beating up on the bad teams
All that and only 2 superbowls still last in the NFC East
Nfc
Where are all the hurts haters he's superbowl mvp now
sensational |||
Congratulations Kansas city chiefs on amazing season it wasn't your night the best team lost imma get eagles jersey and use it as pooper scooper in west philly
I am a Kansas City Chiefs fan. Congratulations to the Philadelphia eagles they played one hell of a game Jalen hurts is a class act guy. Now maybe Kansas City Chiefs will wake up get rid of Matt Nagy and FIX THE OFFENSIVE LINE. JUST AN ABSOLUTE POOR SHOWING. An embarrassment. Eagles defense totally dominated the chiefs. Great defense.
Faze Jev is so happy his team won
Love Hurts
Pretty close game
This wasn't the Super bowl. This was the Super smack down bowl folks. The Philly Eagles vs the Kansas city lizards
Best defense is the best offense.
Mahomes the GOAT? That guy did not show 1 sec of GOAT leadership/character that game Absolute humiliation and I love it!
"There are kindergarteners out there playing this game with more skill than the entire Kansas defenseat least they know how to protect their QB!"""
"Uh, can we start calling these penalty ""draws"" the ""Philly Flop""?"
Best SB in years.
Mahomes played a rare awkward match.
Heck to the YEAH . Thank you. GO BIRDS
"Cooper Dejean was MVP. That play was the dagger. It could have been 10-7 , and instead that play made it a three-score game early. I think that was the dagger"
PAtrick Mahomes owes all Chiefs fans an apology
Refs are going to ruin football. Just 3 minutes in and already two terrible soft calls in the highlights.
Dont recommend- don't care
"Eagles defense went crazy this game, chiefs offense looked terrible 95% of the game"
Fly eagles fly
Couldn't watch this. Genuinely embarrassing.
6 sacks on a QB who likes to play backyard school football... THIS IS WHY THAT DOES NOT WORK IN THE NFL... this tape will be reviewed by every team in the NFL the Chiefs got EXPOSED..
They crushed them.
"Wow, they are sitting ducks out there. Very upsetting Congrats Chiefs...we have now the worst game in all of history."
No-one in the top 50 comments has mentioned the scoreboard. It looks unfinished.
"14:14 illegal forward pass , they still was trying to let the chiefs get away with things"
Kelsey drop of has been swift
Great defense won the game for eagles.
Congratulations to the Eagles!
"The Chiefs owe everybody an apology... but it was kind of fun, so if they want to repeat this sort of performance several more times, it'd probably be okay."
"NFL it's time to revamp your halftime shows. There used to be shows, with musicians, playing their instruments during these shows. Mix it up, a little rock, pop, rap, country, whatever. The last 3 years have been boring in comparison to previous shows."
Really boring game
This is what the Buccaneers defense did to the Chiefs where they never let Mahomes settle & just harassed him all game. Well done to the Eagles
I don't understand American football hahahahah
"alotta chat about spags these last 2 weeks, eagles picked almost every blitz"
fixed games football is about money how much did the NFL buy off the Chiefs 15 and 1 they played like a midget football team and made the Eagles look good on the field and crooked as hell no more football its scam go enjoy your family no more football wasting your time the NATIONAL Fake league NFL FAKE
Great game but I hate the computer generated zombies of the game. Regular footage would be better!!!
"First ever SuperBowl watch and I have to say, why is there so many ads?"
I couldnt even get through the highlights lol even that put me to sleep. Not hating just its just a boring game like none other. Rugby league all the way
Offenses win points but Defenses win matches
Brady wouldve came back the difference
TOO BIG TO RIG! THANK YOU EAGLES!!
A dam good game
feels so good what a team
Taylor Swift won yesterday. She's from Pennsylvania.
"Eagles just repeated what the Bucs did to Mahomes, give him no time and he is just another QB. Glad for Barkley getting out of that he'll hole to a ring, great to see it."
"This was very informative, appreciate it."
"The Chiefs would have lost to a soccer team with how they played, let alone to this brick wall of a defense! Congrats to the Eagles!"
Tom brady would have turned this game around. WIthout protection mahomes folds like a red hot snickers bar Werewolves of london
I hope they play those game at Nick Wright's funeral.
No TD for Barkley thanks
down 34 0 on madden to honor the chiefs
The NFL wins again. People will keep watching and scream rigged when they lose.
"Perfect result, the Chiefs got stomped!!"
"The 2014 Seahawks, 2016 Broncos, 2021 Buccaneers, and 2025 eagles are the greatest defensive performances Ive ever seen in superbowl history. Granted the 2025 chiefs dont have some super talented offense but the fact the eagles generated pressure like every play was crazy"
This was like when the bully gets bullied
MAYBE TAYLOR SWIFT WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOME EAGLE LOVING
hard2 win 3peat Brady's hpy!
Congrats to eagle's Next year for sure KC..
Taylor Swift jinx
Hate both teams but go eagles baby
Worse halftime show ever
end.
"In their last 4 super bowls this was the only game the chiefs whistled for a holding penalty, also Bauns INT and Hopkins drop before the 2nd half were so huge"
"Don't like either of these teams, but it was extra nice to see kc on the losing end."
"Almost as bad as the 55-10 beatdown that the 9ers gave the Broncos when I was growing up. The refs were a non factor, and that makes ALL the difference."
What the hell was all that so called music / white noise at the break? Terrible.
This is my favorite thing ever
Check out the referee catch from Devonta Smith to the ref after his touchdown.
"As a Cowboys fan, congratulations Eagles! Impressive win on the field, even more so, for a lot of people, off the field!"
Write a song about that b*tch hahaha
What happened to the chiefs O Line? It was like watching grown men toss around little kids.
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
Defense wins championships!
What a surprise that the refs didn't negate each and every great Philadelphia TD and FG....a corrupt bunch finally got their just desserts!
"Mahomes is still a class act. But, tonight the much better team won and won big. KC will have to do something about their offensive line!!!"
Seriously boring
"As someone who's from the other kind of football, this game looks like 2014 Brasil vs Germany (1:7), that was a brutal beat down.."
"Thank godness, my god"
I dont get all the hate for KC
"For the entire season, the Chiefs kept skating by teams by a few points, but they were exposed tonight. The Bills would have played better."
"Tom Brady is the GOAT. Mahomes ain't on the same level as him. Mahomes got smoked in 2 Super Bowls while Brady was able to come back from 28-3 in the Super Bowl. Brady has 7 rings and Mahomes only has 3, nuff said"
"Tonked, embarrassed and annihilated, oh happy days. Watch those Eagles soar."
"Started off 34 NOTHING, man dont you love to see it!! All of the mindless chiefs fans were so confident, the amount of comments i saw saying the Eagles had no chance and that the fans were stupid for having hope is crazy! Fly Eagles Fly! Forever"
The refs knew the President was watching
Justice is done for Valentina Guzman Murillo and her mother who died in that nosedive plane crash in Philadelphia.
They beat them so bad they should get the 2022 trophy too. Philly should be the team in a dynasty
Andy Reed should have pulled Patrick Mahomes and put in Taylor Swift.
The refs were trying their best to help KC tho
"They missed a lot of Holding calls on the KC offensive line, this game couldve been even uglier."
Chiefs should not have been there the Ravens and Eagles game would have been more impressive.
The most boring sport I've ever seen. My God.
Never use these scoreboard ever again
"On the bright side, the Chiefs O-line probably still had a better night than Drake."
Saw this coming a mile a way. The better team in the bills v ravens game lost and the better team in the bills v chiefs game lost only to play the best team in the NFC yeah 40 pc nugget happens
Did the check for the refs bounce or something
Bookies must be laughing
Somehow a blowout was one of the most entertaining pleasing Superbowls.
FDT End Racism
Guys did u no the cheifs were getting more money for loosing
"This one was tough: I hate both teams, and both QBs equally."
Kc looking sloppy than a MF!!!!
I love that A.J Brown celebration tribute to King LBJ was dope asf
"I kid you not when cooper took that back, i almost mentioned the entire town of sioux falls could hear me. #FLYBIRDSFLY"
It was really 40-14 lets be honest
We all won today.
THE WAY COOPER DEJEAN PICKED MAHOMES OFF WAS SO TUFF!!!!!!
Eagles are champs.
What a glorious morning.
Bills would've played a better game than this. Not sure why the Chiefs didn't try to run the ball. I turned the game off after the halftime show.
Eagles are the Champs thank God but I'm still stunned how in the world eagles founded a way to shut down mahomes
Mahomes trying to do the Tom Brady comeback
Did you see how the Chiefs meet all them easy touchdowns at the end of the football game? The Chiefs could have done this all through the football game with no problem nobody's faked out on this fake football
America is saved!!!
That shovel pass was so over the line
They must told the eagles to stop sacking Mahomes.
FDT
Mahomes was thinking something else
I know nothing about American Football but these hi lights were great - id rather watch this than the awful HT show
"Eagle's Defense were ""MVP's""..."
"Feeling so sorry for the Chiefs, for Mahomes, Kelce, Hopkins, Jones and all the rest of these guys, brilliant season spoiled in such humiliating way (Waiting for hateful comments for being a Chiefs fan, come on guys, I deserved that.....)"
That defensive pressure from Eagles is amazing to watch.
This was the worst fake Super Bowl in the history of the NFL- the betting world has taken over the NFL
Glad tge chiefs lost Haha
Wow.. what a wipping! When people start comparing teams and quarterbacks.. saying how this kid is the real GoAt .. I'm saying The True Goat came back from a 28-3 to win the game 34-28. Now this where you know a clutch team from a non clutch team and where the True GOAT came and turned EVERYTHING around. Philly exposed them in every way! Destroyed them defensively and offensively. Lucky they pulled them startes 4th quarters because they wouldn't make 20 like they did.
T. S. didnt help much either
"Thank you Eagles, on behalf of the whole NFL fan base, fly Eagles fly! Said from a Buccaneers fan!"
KC showed how BAD they Really are without ref help
Who else lost on their Super Bowl bets because of how bad the Chiefs played?
FlyEaglesFly congratulations
"Definitely, Philadelphia won thanks to the defence. Kansas lost at the 2nd touchdown by Dehean, after that they lost concentration."
"Apparently, the Eagles defense scored 40 points, since apparently, according to ""diehard fans"", only one side of the ball matters."
Who Said McDuffie Was The Beat CB In The League! Boy Got Exposed Every Play! Jaylon Johnson Would Have Done Much Better! Good Job Eagles. Hope The League Ready For Chicago Next Year!
Refs couldnt help the chiefs
"What this game has taught us- Is that Swifties DID NOT cause an uproar over the loss, no drama or chaos, hm.. But if Chiefs would have won, guess what side/type of fans would cause an uproar, call it rigged, blame it on so and so because of Taylor Swift and how it's sooooo rigged for her.. Tin foil hat wearing individuals now and days are something else and it's getting ridiculous and bad real fast in this country.."
"Well see yall in six months. Have a safe and wonderful spring and summer, NFL fans."
Chiefs were exposed by the Eagles
Fly Eagles fly !! Champions again !!! The re-match was so worth it!!!
It was nice of the eagles to let KC score a few tds but they could of really blown them away
GO BIRDS
Thank you Eagles.....Thank you..
KC was dominated and beaten on all levels and on all fronts.
Eagles won with the help of there God. Amen
Eagles defence were unbelievable! Pure perfection! They dominated Chiefs and made them look like amateurs!
Eagles wanted it more. Plain and simple
There was no game
Surprised them MFs finally got pressured by a lot of pissed fans about those blatant bias calls and decisions and finally let them players play. This should have been bills/Texans v eagles anyway
"Great defense wins championships, Eagles have one."
Mahomes u da real MVP
But but but the refs
"0:55 Nah, Brown got his fingers wrapped up in McDuffie's facemask, definitely PI. Good call, you can't contend with fingers in the facemask. 2:23 Once again. ""I don't like that one either."" No way, that was such a late and poorly positioned jump. Another good call. 7:53 Another good call. Bolton got an 3 extra steps before blindsiding Barkley in an injury causing manner."
the help from the refs for this was insane. the philadelphia bradys
"No more Mahomes ""Goat"" talk.. It is still a toss up between Brady and Montana.. Montana never threw an interception in a Super Bowl.."
"It's an entertaining ""sport""."
UPLOAD FULL GAME
Kansas city should have stayed home and started getting arrowhead ready to move.
u know the refs were trying their best to make the chiefs win. withe the PI and falkse start
I had a strong feeling the Eagles Defense was going to crush the Chiefs and they did! Congratulations Eagles! If they stay healthy they could accomplish a 3 peat!
Well at least you can't say the Refs helped the Chiefs win....this time.
We seen this song and dance before. Chiefs o-line gets crushed. They go out and get some line-men to protect the QB. And add some more weapons on offense amd defense and win two straight again. That NFL script is crazy work
Got the Eagles defense dog walking chiefs offense and Mahomes and then you got Jalen Hurts dog walking the Chiefs defense we all knew the achiefs were frauds that always needed the help of the officiating crew to win any game
Even as an eagles fan this is disappointing and I feel bad for Mahomes
KC got lit up today
"Had no dawg in the hunt this time but the favoritism allowed the Chiefs this year. Oh, yeah. Bye-Bye. Congrats, Philly!"
"JUSTICE! Also... Perfect example why IMO Mahomes is never going to be a GOAT! He is just excellent in a running team! Instead of motivating his teammates, being a LEADER, when things are not in their favour, he is sitting there chewing on his mouthpiece and is not communicating with ANYONE! He is just good at the Chiefs, give him another team and he would never be able to lead them to the championship! After this season it is a fact (for me at least)! Fly Eagles Fly! Very happy like all the other 95% of all NFL fans!"
I am not an NFL follower - watched the Netflix NFL series. This looked to me like Mahomes was depending to much on himself? He was totally neutralized ?
MAHOMES GOT KNOCKED THE DUCK OUT LOVE IT
"Now i wanna hear shannon slam PH!! Can you imagine what he would say if Brady did that in a superbowl?? But he won't he will blame the oc and praise eagles dc, which r valid points. However the goat conversation is over tom brady needs his own wing in the HOF"
"The best part about the game beside the Chiefs losing was not seeing Taylor Swift, funny how the cameras werent on her because Kelce choked, retire Kelce your done and take the washed up so called singer with you"
That was a total one sided mauling. Eagles were on a different level.
Easily one of the worst Super Bowl appearances in NFL history. Possibly the worst KC game in franchise history.
"They should start awarding the mvp to the defence or defensive components like the front 4, or linebacking core or dbs."
SKO BIRDS
I hate the eagles but I hate the cheating Chiefs more let's go Philly
The first time KC was on the Eagles half of the field was in the late 3rd quarter. Down by 34 Lmao
"Breaking News: 2033 End of Time and Rapture, based on growing Biblical Evidence and Timeline. Ebiblefellowship!!!"
That defense was on mahomes from the first snap
The Eagles restored my faith in the NFL; Fly Eagles Fly
No KC refs in SB. No help comingo
The Eagles today sorta remind me of SB42 when the NY Giants defense stood up to the 16-0 Patriots
Crappie game
Let's go birds!!! Wildest night of the year so far!! Fly Eagles Fly!
Remember when Brady lost to the Eagles in superbowl and refused to shake the hand of Eagles quarterback??? He's such a sore loser.
7:20 WHAT DID HE JUST SAY? bruh
"No one expected us too win the media was hype up for lions , josh allen mahomes and jackson ....but they forgot about us and we kept reminding them by Winning Keep the main the main thing"
"Jordan Mailata is the real MVP,"
From now upon people can say yeah we lost the SB but at least not as badly as the Chiefs
Well see you chumps again next year. Enjoy it for now.
Maybe Jordan Love isn't so bad afterall.
take that swifties lol
I guess the cheats superbowl check didnt clear.
"With 6 quarters, the Chiefs might have made it..."
So glad the Eagles didnt give Swift a chance to celebrate with an accompanying camera pan.
Brady and the pats should have had the three peat. Its always the eagles ruining the Three Peat for teams
Don't really no much about football but much respect to both team
Wow Taylor Swifts' boyfriend's quarter back didnt do well at all
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
It all makes sense now; Taylor Swift told her Chiefs team to throw this SuperBowl since she did not want anyone of the Chief players to visit the White House as long as Trump's there
What is called referee game ever. Where is the passenger fierce when the Philly quarterback is overthrown as receiver by 7 yd. That's just plain bulshit there should have been 22 points deducted from philly. Which would have made the Chiefs win. Bulshit referees bulshit NFL
YES GO EAGLES
boring af. lamest sb ever
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"See what happens when the refs don't help, they don't score points till the eagles put the 3rd string in lmfao. Do glad eagles embarrassed the chiefs, fly eagles fly!!!! just absolutely can't stand the chiefs."
"CONGRATULATIONS TO THE EAGLES. US REAL FOOTBALL FANS MADE ENOUGH NOISE SO YOU ALL WOULDN'T BE CHEATED BY THE REFS AND THE CHIEFS!! NOW AS A COWBOYS FAN, I CAN GO BACK TO HATING YOU!!!"
They made Jalen Hurts beat them and he did just that.
I'm dying please pray for me. I'm only 15
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
Quelle grosse claque reu par KC
16:00 man I could watch Pat get hit with that one two combo ALL DAY
Unfortunately history was not made
"f you taylor, f you kelce, f you mahomo. best thing was seeing everyone boo taylor . up the eagles, the grinding machine has been halted"
"Absolutely destroyed them Chefs...40-6, with less than 3 minutes to go"
"im glad nick sirianni gave guys like r clark the middle finger by winning the sb, lets see him talk now."
Philadelphia's defense did to Kansas City what Denver's defense did to the Carolina Panthers in their Superbowl matchup. Total dominance
It wasnt a 40 point blowout! It was a 40 second waste of time. I turned it off after the first 1/4. What a totally boring sport!
I am happier with the crushing defeat of Mahomes and the Chiefs than with the victory of the Eagles
No spoiler!!!!! .
Not sure whats going on in Travis Kelce mind as the contract for him to play with the Philadelphia Eagles may or may not be still available I seriously think the Kansas City Chiefs entire offensive line gave up the entire game to humiliate humble Patrick Mahomes Except for rookie Xavier worthy and Travis Kelce at the very end Sad way to find out who your friends really are
Even with the refs help the Chiefs still lost
The Eagles were Swift.
16:58 if the defense only rushes 4 but it's not all 4 D-linemen is it not considered a blitz?
"Congrats, Eagles! Congrats, Eagles fans!"
Not a fan of either team although I do follow the NFL. Caught the last quarter of the bowl and the Chiefs flat out choked! I can imagine all the Chiefs fans crying!
I dont EVER want to hear questions about Jalens arm again
The world is healing.
Statrick Padomes
Ik on the first call against the eagles we all sighed and said here we go again
I love Hurts shoe. These 11's are fire
What a stupid game this is
Football won..kansas city thiefs lost
"I'm just happy we don't have to hear about this ""3 peat"" nonsense anymore."
Awe dont start crying mahommes and kelce hahaha!!!! Better luck next time lames!!! Cant pay the refs for that one!!!!
Philly's def was Just superb
Vegas said chiefs can lose but Barkley cant score
The MVPs were definitely the Defense and the Offense line for sure. Definitely a group effort.
Worst game in nfl history. So scripted.... wwe would be proud. And thus is a national sport lol come to Ireland and we show ya how to play fair
May the chiefs never get to another Super Bowl again
Media darling QB Patrick Mahomes is OVERRATED............
The Great New Orleans Massacre.
"Hurts is an undoubted superstar but man....the defensive line were the superstars of this game, every one of them."
Thats the way it should be. A FAIR GAME
Not that it matters BUT mahomes was across the line of scrimmage at 1:15 in the 3rd quarter? They got lucky they even scored on that drive. Eagles showed who were the fakes tonight
"So the Kansas Cheaters lost, nice"
By the looks of this game maybe the refs really did keep the Chiefs in it all season.
Hats off to the Eagles for standing by Hurts and letting him develop A lot of haters wanted to dump him Now he's SB MVP
TAYLOR WITCH BAD OMEN!
Taylor Swift had a terrible game it cost them
Horrible halftime show
This was the chiefs we saw ALL year but this time without the refs and black magic on their side
Soft af football. Yep nfl still sux.
Congratulations EGALES 40 VS CHIEFS 22
"As someone who's always hated the Eagles, thank you Eagles for embarrassing the Chiefs ."
So beautiful to see the Eagles dominate and end the Chiefs dominance so .Swiftly!
"I'm so glad the Philly fans 3rd grade education paid off and can spell E.A.G.L.E.S. by far the worst fans in the league, total dirtballs"
What is this? Eggball?
The Chiefs are the 2025 Super Bowl CHUMPS!!!!!!!....going to work happy today.
"On behalf of all football fans across the world, Thank You Philly!!!!!"
"Give it up for the New York Giants helping Saquon Barkley win an NFL Superbowl ring. And to think he wanted to stay a New York Giant. Taylor Swift, who's that? The Philadelphia Eagles are the New Superbowl champions. Saquon Barkley and Cooper DeJean both of them won the Superbowl on their birthday. The big bad wolf has been dethroned."
I saw the first offensive interference call and thought it was just going to be another example of the 12th man ( the refs/nfl ) winning another game for KC. THANK GOD IT DIDNT HAPPEN THIS TIME!!! And this is coming from a Cowboys fan. ( You know something fukd up has been going on when a cowboys fan wants Philly to win ).
Kamala lost the Chiefs lost pretty good year so far
"GO EAGLES, SUPERBOWL CHAMPS !!!!!"
The only way for the NFL to redeem itself was an eagles blowout of the chiefs.
This was a complete stomp out
congrats eagles!!
I guess Brady had a talk with the DefCord of the eagles and told him to watch the tampa/chiefs SB and i guess they listened
"Hey Edub... Are you up there? The eagles did it.. And they also did it for you I am certain...man I hope you can see it and cheer yourself up man. Second time they won it after you pass. It does certainly does cheer me up while at the same time makes me cry.. We miss you and your music so much.. Rest easy man and thanks for everything. ""I am an eagle baby flying over mine fields"" #TTRFOREVER"
WAY TO GO PHLLY CONGRADULATIONS
Cant believe the eagles beat the chiefs
"Congrats Eagles. KC offensive line wont survive the summer break thats for sure. Now lets wait and see Eagles turning into villains if they win the next SB. Conspiracies will arise, hater gonna increase tenfold thats how internet works :)"
What happened to the KC cheats
NO QUATERBACK NO MVP.....
I pet the eagles ..they didn't disappoint me .. congratulations and big cheers for the eagles
"Course I didn't watch the Super Bowl again obvious reasons, but I sure am playing the hell out of those highlights from the Eagles yeah Hertz out class Mahomes by far. It's what happens when it's not fixed."
love the blatant missed illegal forward pass that led to KC scoring its first 6 points at 14:12
So did Taylor win?
Too much stop starting
Didnt watch it. Didnt care. Browns were not in it. Looking at the highlights think Mahones got a concussion in the first and that ended the game.
Dont ever say manholes is in the same class as Brady ever
16:10 this is now playing as a screensaver on my computer
The Chiefs Tribe bandwagon will be losing many of their fans after the loss.
For Kobe
Where is Taylor swift
Did Travis Kelce play? Havent seen him in the game
How many busses were flipped in Philly tonight?
12:33 uncalled Facemask penalty. They called a holding instead of facemask.
"Credit to philly d- line, but man, that chiefs o line was stinky"
"Mahomes looked, as always , like twinkle bell prancing around like on a drunken skirt. Kelsie looked like he'd been smoking something."
The last time the Chiefs were beat this bad the white man was taking there land....
"I'm Indonesian and watched this in the morning, it was my first football match. I was thinking of getting some chicken rice for lunch. Bought a Philly cheese instead."
"Not the biggest Fan of Jalen Hurts the Player. But man he has played two excellent Super Bowls. Credit where its due to an absolute Team Player! Congrarulations, he deserved that"
Patty mahomes sh*t the bed lol
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! Wow! 3 consecutive you're LUCKY to have 3 period!!!
14:13 Mahomes looks past the line of scrimmage on that shovel pass...
I know what the problem was the chiefs forgot to bring the extra 8 guys to the game
Awful game and horrible anti whit music at the halftime show
6:21 WE GOT A WHITE CORNERBACK SCORING A PICK SIX IN THE SUPERBOWL BEFORE GTA 6
after that insane offensive PI called on the 4th down i thought it was gonna be a wrap with the refs giving KC another free win but Mahomes really went out the way to lose this one and choke another ring
"Brady said nope, you not touching my dynasty."
"Course I didn't watch the Super Bowl again obvious reasons, but I sure am playing the hell out of those highlights from the Eagles yeah Hertz out class Mahomes by far. It's what happens when it's not fixed."
Lmfao game was not even critical chiefs didnt stand a chance even if they had all the controversial calls and flags when its time its time Aint not three peet gonna happen over Philly
Hearing the whole stadium Boo Swift was the best part of the whole game..besides the Eagle's domination
14:13 - am i trippin or illegal forward pass?
"Why chiefs are so hated? Just a real question, I am not fan of any teams, just like to watch NFL"
"Thank you, Eagles! ~ seahawks fan"
What what the KC Chiefs should have never been in Superbowl the refs took that game from Buffalo Bills karma came in embarrassing way good job Philadelphia Eagles
Was Mahomes not ahead of the line of scrimmage when he threw the ball to kelce on their touchdown run
Alright bro you gotta admit the timing on @15:40 is funny af
?
DOMINATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Didn't matter in the end but in the third quarter that shovel pass from mahomes he was passed the line of scrimmage with no call then the very next highlight that touchdown pass of you watch at the beginning of the play Brandon Graham was held with no call they got a little help here and there and still got dominated
The best the Chiefs could do is avoid a complete blowout. By half time this thing was done.
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a brilliant win! No 3-peat but the Chiefs are the closest to achieve it. I am sure Mahomes and the Chiefs will come back and capture another Super Bowl championship.
mahomes smi yauvv
"On the positive side, KC did stop Barkley."
My brother is going crazy
Eagles
Razbili ih...
Great D by the Eagles.
So disappointed in this game !!!!
Took them a super team to finally beat mahomes hats off to the eagles
As long as Taylor Swift lost. Thank you God!
Hurts is impressive though and fast pat getting old already to me he looked hurt a lil bit and all them drop passes the cheifs was so gased
@13:15
Eagles r americas team now! Been a fan for 60 years. Loved seeing the eagles dominate them. No excuses KC.
"As someone outside the US, I had absolutely no context and just had a blast watching the spectacle!"
As an NHL fan I immediately looked for Sportsnet highlights over the NFL highlights. Shafted.
Word is Roger Goodell will be drug testing the whole Philadelphia team after that performance.
Who else saw Patty mahomes curl his bottom lip. Lololol
you seen that lack of effort of Patrick Maholmes to make a tackle to prevent the return TD from his own interception at the 3 yrd line?????? Yall please get off Cam's back because the booth control everything
"Y'all want to talk about how BAD the AFC is now? How does no team get past this massively overrated one in the AFC is just beyond me. But I know, I know... if the Eagles were in the AFC, they wouldn't be able to get past Mahomes and the chie....OH WAIT!"
Reminder: EDP445 is still and always will be a PDFile!!! Go Eagles!
Rigged?? Anyone??
Haha lmfao didnt get that one did you chiefs!!! Go lick your wounds. Dont have the refs on your side and you dont win! Hmmmm.
Eagles defense beat the stuffing out of them.
Crazy how bad Mahomes looks when referees dont bail him out
We seriously need to consider a way to give the MVP to the defensive line.
So Travis not proposing to Taylor Swift at the end of the game
Andy's getting too old.
Man that rams eagles game was the real Super Bowl
I'm just happy the Kansas City Swifts lost.
"Chiefs, ""That half-time shows was ro long. That's why we lost.' Oh wait down 24=0 nevermind!"
Satan came for Chiefs soul finally.
Finally no more Taylor Swift mahomes got destroyed. There's contenders and there is pretenders
"Thank you Eaglesfor winning the Super Bowl You did us a favor by destroying the Chiefs, otherwise the NFL would be showing Taylor Swift jumping and screaming for every touchdown Chiefs made"
"Weird how no one is talking about the NFL being rigged because the Chiefs lost, isnt it?"
40-6. Real score. Forty to six.
Kudos to the eagles
Was the chiefs best player injured today? That guy named the ref?
This what itblooks like when the refs cant call all the bs calls for the chiefs
"I don't understand this sport. But you clearly see the green team has a lot more time to throw the ball. They block very well the white players. Also, I think this is more of a show than a sport. Sometimes I wonder if some things are not staged. Not so fake as Wrestling of course. But even so...."
"""Say drake"""
Mahomes is a average QB. No GOAT
eagles D put in the work. never seen mahomes harassed like that before
WHERE WAS KELCE?
Where's the DEI in the NFL and NBA
"Fraud team finally got exposed. Total annihilation. I don't want to hear how Mahomes is one of the greats, total absolute mid QB."
To Bad no New Record for the Chiefs but 3x in the Row going to the Super Bowl is a Great Achievment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone pray for me please I'm sick
3-peat is not an easy feat.
The Eagles made the Chiefs look like a high-school team.
Mahomes is genuinely in the GOAT discussion but this might have been the worst SB performance of all time. He stat padded against the Eagles 2nd unit late in the game but he was awful until the game was completely over.
"The Super Bowl was EQUALLY BORING as the Half Time Show. The game was boring bcs Eagles wiped out to the Chiefs, but the Half Time Show was brutally exhausting to watch bcs it looks like the producers, directors of arts, promps, writers was not payed enough or I even ask me if they were protesting like showing off this awful ideas for the performance. The last one that I watched and was boring to me, it was The Weeknd, but with this show , I went to a store, comeback and the stenography it was the same also the rhythm, and I was wondering if Kendrick was singing the firt song yet."
After Seahawks Broncos second worst Superbowl.
Lmfao game was not even critical chiefs didnt stand a chance even if they had all the controversial calls and flags when its time its time Aint no three peet gonna happen over Philly
Game was won in the trenches. D-Line of the Eagles was unbelievable. Tom Brady might be the worst broadcast guy ever. Olsen should have been doing this game.
Eagles are officially the goat of all teams. Beat Brady and Mahomes in their best seasons of their career. Go birds
This is the 1st superbowl I intentionally didn't watch because I thought the Chiefs was going to win. Boy do I regret that decision.
Way to go uncle Swifty you really dominated
"This may be the first time I see mahomes and chiefs play really badly... for straight toward end of 3 quarter, chiefs make no attempt touchdowns! And mahomes... whoa he's usually just brilliant but he got loads sacked by eagles! But hey... congratulations to eagles, really like that team from UK!"
It just goes to show Mahomes was out and about making a name for himself when there were no quarterbacks to really speak of and now that you got other people getting a shot that goes to show cheating to get you so far but talent will get you further That's why the Eagles won...
"Yes, it was a blowout, but man, some incredible plays by both sides, really enjoyable."
Great win over kc
Pretty bad atmosphere
D line drilled Myhomboy a new one
Excellent interception and touchdown by DeJean. Glad the Eagles won in spite of how unfair everything has been.
thank you . ( 2025 / Feb / 10 )
No chiefs 3 peat the dynasty has been halted those fools got committed like they committed a crime
This is exactly what I visualizedAPDTMH
Fantastic result for the whole of football. The Eagles were head and shoulders above any other unit this season .....
The chiefs and Mahomes were so exposed
Taylor Swift
The conspiracy theorists are really quiet...
it the cheifs got cooked
"You all can say what you want but ""Ora"" is truly a thing. Once Travis Kelce said ""it will be an honor to have the president at the super bowl, mostly every Chiefs fan I know including myself started rooting for the Eagles. Hey Kelce, is does matter who a person is."
In general no one wants to see these match up from a neutral perspective. The swifties vs the brawlers (fans). Philly is the most hated city when it comes to sport. No one like to visit Philly when his Team plays against in any sport. And then Kansas- who wants another era of a dominant AFC Team with the help of the refs? Next season this protection bubble for Mahomes is over. Hopefully. The Halftime show was boring as hell only Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam puts a smirk on my face.
Calling false start by the snapper at 5:19 The officials tried to cover for KC but they stunk so bad wasn't able to help them..That call was all BS
"AS A PHILLY GUY IM ECSTATIC OUR GUYS WON, AND DAM THEY DID A GREAT JOB BUT IT DIDNT HAVE THE SAME MAGIC AS THE FIRST WIN IN UMPTEEN YEARS AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. THAT EAGLES TEAM HAD INJURY AFTER INJURY AND GUYS WOULD JUST STEP UP AND MAKE IT HAPPEN. THAT TEAM HAD EVERYTHING AGAINST THEM, EVEN LOST THEIR NUMBER 1 QB (Carson wentz) and NICK FOLES STEPPED UP ALONG WITH A SERIOUS TEAM EFFORT TO WIN! THATS HOW THE GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYED, TEAM WORK!"
5:37 if the Cheifs moved first why the eagles get the penalty
Lets hear about how football is scripted and the chiefs always win? (Crickets)
Man D-Line for the eagles was so untouchable! Absolutely amazing
Watching the Chiefs CHOKE & LOSE in embarrassing fashion will never get old!!
Eagles just follow the blueprint given by the Buccaneers
This - was - so - satisfying!
Wap wap wap wap wap
Too little too late KC
Kansas City Refs didn't work this time
Eagles D Line didnt give the Refs a chance to cheat. Thats what threw off the Chiefs
"Plenty of touch ups, hugs and thugs. Boooooooring......"
"7:19 ""They haven't been able to do much today against this very formidable, tough Chiefs defense."" My good sir, the score at this point in the game is PHL 17 - KC 0, and there's only 3 minutes and 3 seconds remaining in the first half. What game are you watching?"
In short - 0:40 for the neutral fan
Philadelphia proud
I still can't believe that they didn't give this to the Chiefs. It goes to show the power of negative press coverage.
1997 Vikings 2004 Steelers 2007 Patriots 2011 Packers 2015 Panthers 2024 Lions 2024 Chiefs The 15 wins curse is real!
The eagles made the chiefs look old! Kelce was a no-show! The offensive line looked intimidated!
Too much swifties
A great dominant perfomance from the Philadelphia Eagles in this game and a big congratulations to them for winning this year's super bowl from me a Kansas City Chiefs fan
15:44 absolutely best play of the game! Mahomes squashed like a bug
Some are sleeping with this eagles defense I said before the game either the eagles gonna blow them out or its gonna be close but I had the Eagles winning either way mainly its because KC really dont have any crazy receivers I expected Patrick too do better tho go Eagles
Philadelphia kicker
Im a better sports caster than Brady and I dont speaka da English
That HURTS!
"5 days ago, i had a dream where Eagles won. It was correct. Super happy"
the republicans lost
FLYY EAGLES FLYY
Replace the entire Chiefs O Line
So this is the Chiefs without the refs help eh ...
I was rooting for the eagles but i did not expect by a long shot that it will be a total annialation of the chiefs and mahomes
Hurts pass to Dotson = pretty
Nunca vi alguem entregar um jogo como o Mahomes. Foi ridiculo
Poor Queefies. NO 3 in a row. lol.
Thank you Eagles for saving football.
19:00 can someone explain what happened there? I'm assuming it's some sort of gesture to agree to end the game because it's impossible for the other team to make a comeback?
Never seen the chiefs play so terrible
Go birds
8:40 AJ Brown with a tribute to the GOAT
Just saying but big shout out to Jordan mailata the South Pacific Islanders are proud buddy
"The refs finally called a relatively fair game today (makeup calls for bad calls on the Eagles, called some holdings on the Chiefs, didn't just call back every INT or 3rd down failure of Mahomes, etc.), and the result was that Chiefs got absolutely ANNIHILATED. The Eagles' pass rush resulted in Mahomes often speeding up his clock unnecessarily and literally running himself into sacks like a rookie, all the while ignoring open receivers reminiscent of NYJ Darnold seeing ghosts. Congrats to the Eagles, but I feel bad for the fanbases of the 49ers, Bills, Ravens, and Bengals for being robbed of fair SB opportunities. Mahomes is a very talented and great QB, but his run has been the most fraudulent in sports history, in my opinion, relative to the accolades that the media just bestows upon him. The damage by the refs and NFL is already done, so this loss alone cannot ""regress him and the Chiefs to the mean."" Burrow, Lamar, Allen, etc. can't get those fraudulent Mahomes wins back. Still, this is a good step towards humbling and quieting many ignorant people."
Always a good game when the refs aint rigged
"To keep a Chiefs team off the board until 30 seconds of the end of the THIRD quarter with muliple sacks and interceptions is testement to hard work, athleticism and determination of the defense and the expertise of Fangio. The offence won the game, the defense won the chamionship. Also a shout out to Jake Elliot who, despite not having the best of seasons with the boot, was perfect on the night. In keeping the Chiefs D occupied by Berkeley for the great majority of the game, it allowed Kellen Moore and Hurts to exploit the gaps and find Smith and Brown with the arm. The final score flattered the Chiefs as the Eagles knew they had the game won. A great catch by Worthy late on though. The Eagles defeathered the Chiefs."
We smokin on a Kansas City pack
NFL was tired if all the Referee comments and decided to take ppls money that tho the Chiefs was a lock.
Chiefs getting called for holding penalties? Finally!
The Eagles have been the best team in the NFL all year. Somehow though they seemed to fly under the radar and no one knew how good they really were! I think this game in which they made even the Chiefs look bad showed that! (Not a fan of either team btw)
Mahomes eating up so many sacks and eagles D never game him any room
As a Broncos fan THANK YOU PHILLY for this highly enjoyable Superbowl
You dont disrespect and stand on the hood of a GNX.. my car anxiety was through the roof!
Eagles kicker was center every time. Money balls every time too.
I loved every minute of this game tonight. The Eagles proved that they are better this time around. I just hope the rowdies behave on broad street tonight.
That D Hop drop I will never understand
Thank you Eagles from Italy. Devastating team. Remember me the best Patriots era. There are no weakness. Fly Eagles fly
"The fix was on ive seen this script before, the betting favorites the team with the hype always loses hmm .philly was the better team and its the 2nd time philly beat the clear favourites"
The final score actually flattered the Chiefs; the game was over at half time. Heard a lot of talk before the game about the 'fix' being in for the Chiefs - lol...
As an Australian watching Down Under Eagles Defence was awesome
What a snooze fest but yeah for the eagles to do that was impressive
Where's Taylor?
Go eagles
Well done Eagles for beating the officials!
"Fly Eagles Fly . ! By the way, at halftime the eagles had the same points than for 2 years. So now we know the answer of the question what happens when these Chiefs meet a big quality Team."
But I thought everything was rigged for KC?!?!?
....over to you Nick Wright!!!
Cheats fans got just what Cheats fans deserved!
8:47
Is that Thomas Brady I heard in broadcast sweet I thought they fired your'as but SB champ doesn't disengage that easy
SB MVP JALEN HURTS IS H1M
Did you see the way the chiefs made their touchdowns all the sudden at the end of the game they could have made those touchdowns all through the game this is the worst fake Super Bowl we've ever seen the betting world has taken over the NFL
They look like they were playing with kids in the schoolyard excellent my guys love yall
Our defense were the real MVP's! They were all over Mahomes! We packed them boys up like spam meat!
I'm sure I'm not the first one to say this but isn't it crazy how both SB lost by the Chiefs were blowouts.
The Super Bowl was a fake game and the betting world has taken over the NFL
Defense wins Championships 100% of the time.
eagles oline the biggest of the bunch in the league.. showed tonight tossing Dline aside
chiefs spielt ja wie schalke HAHA war ezzz hab dann nebenbei Serie geguckt
"I don't know much about American football, but Mahomes seems to be missing so many wide open passes and forcing difficult passes that keep getting intercepted, or holding the ball too long and getting sacked!"
"Houston, the Eagles have landed !!"
Never ever compare Mahomes & Kelce to TB12 & Gronk. Never!!
Mahomes cant be in the goat conversation any longer Brady kept his team in every superbowl that he played in.
Eagles D had the Mahomes Plan! Take notes everyone!!!
What them Chief fans spitting now. No refs to bail you out of this one.
The defense played like Tampa team. Mahome is not Brady
"Congratulations Eagels!! Most worthy victory!! Enjoy your freshly minted Super Bowl... XXXXXVIIII championship Seasons ending greetings from Northern New England,USA"
"Nobody talking about the scoreboard graphic, I think they should use that more next year"
Mahomes throwing the ball to the defense
Mid game. Football miles ahead
Rejoice we be headed the OPPs with belt to neck
Man this look script
Eagles destroyed them.
"MANNNNNNNNNNNNNN WHY NOBODY MERCY RULED AINT NO WAY IM GETTING BLOWN OUT ""PAUSE!"" LIKE THAT IN A MAJOR GAME ON NATIONAL TV - CRAZY WORK"
"Pressure from the Eagles DL was insane. When they weren't outright sacking Mahomes, they were forcing him to make incompletions and interceptions. They disrupted and controlled the pace the whole game."
Funny what happens when the game is fair.
These are the best teams!
WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN SAMUEL JACKSON AND KENDRICK LAMAR GOT INTO A RELATIONSHIP AFTER THE SUPERBOWL PRESENTATION? LAMAR JACKSON
That Eagles front four great job. They took the Bucs playbook on D.
it's scary how much attention Barkley got. The chiefs designed everything to stop him.
"President Crunk jinxed them, he kept saying on many interviews that he was going for the Chiefs and how great Mahomes is and how one of his senators was Mahomes coach and also recruited him"
Elliot should have won the MVP
KC lost ... #micdrop
Just outplayed simple as that Eagles just to good
That eagles defensive line was absolutely ruthless. Like a pack of wolves to the QB every single play. That chiefs O-line was completely exhausted
"While the Eagles D is great, Mahomes again tended to run around like a chicken with it's head cut off when he felt any kind of pressure"
CHIEFS GOT EXPOSED! Rumor is Taylor Swift has fresh tear drops on her guitar.
"This is what happens when the entire NFL/fans come together cas we tired of the bs! Eagles, youre welcome!"
Pass rush wins championships. Giants Bucs now Eagles
How is this game defined as football. Ridiculous! Its only known for its half time shows
Insane this meltdown for Chiefs........OMG!
Bye bye liberal cry baby chiefs
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DeJean becoming a GigaChad getting a pick six on his birthday. *THAT* Smith Touchdown Brandon Graham getting one more big game Kelce being nowhere to be seen Mahomes seeming to be the only offensive player who was trying 6 sacks on a no blitz defence The score not reflecting how one sided this was This game literally had it all.
"Detroit Lions take note, this should have been you, All in Myles Garrett, Cooper Kupp"
Wow. Now mahomes will ONLY have 3 rings to wear this offseason.....
"Eagles just made this chiefs team look old and slow. That o line looked gassed in the 1st quarter.... the chiefs will be back. And all the people who want to persist about this refs helping the chiefs, do you understand how many people would have to be involved in that. And none of them are leaking a word about it. ??? Makes for a good conspiracy but thats all....... Just give the eagles thier flowers and move on to next year..."
"I don't get this sport. They call it football then they pass with their hands...everyone looks like if they would get tested, the entire front row of people would come positive...breaks all the time...weird."
The Worst Super Bowl Ever I Turned it Off At Halftime Am Just a Fan of The Game Yet One Sided Not Even a Contest
Mahomes wearing a choker for the entire game.
Mahomes ain't winning when Brady is in the house!!!!
WOW Eagles just soaring with their Defense! That's how you stop a mobile QB! Offense & Special Teams took care of business.
BIRBS!
"As a chiefs fan, i must say barkley deserved a ring after his time at the giants and hurts was an oklahoma sooner so in my book hes alright with me, can't win them all, nobody is unbeatable, GG eagles great season, maybe see you next year!"
"Jalen Hurts won a Super Bowl before Allen, Jackson, Burrow, Tua, Goff, Herbert, Cousins think its time that hurts gets some respect but everyone will still glaze Mahomes and Josh Allen"
Mahomes must've bet against himself in this one.
Lol
Lol
Gotta be the Taylors badluck since she aint there to support anymore
BRUHHHHHHHH IF THIS WAS MADDEN 21-0 BLOWOUT
Lol
Twitch
"How is this thing called a sport, worse still, how does it even have that clout to make so much money? Wonders will never cease in this world. Fans of proper football can't possibly survive this without cardiac inducing boredom."
Yes
Rip the satanists
Rob Robert Eric and herman
"As a Chiefs fan, i was impressed with what the Eagles were anle to do. Jalen Hurts and Sawuoen Barkley deserved it! What ruins it is the toxic NFL fanbase that has so much hatred and despair for a team that sinply just wants to win like every other team!? Its really igly and makes me want to stop being an NFL fan. People take it so personal as if the NFL are paying them"
"British guy here, what's going on?"
"a Vic Fangio masterpiece !!! Kelce non existant for the most part, Mahomes seeing the floods of hell getting down on him."
Make names
Those Chiefs got the Paddleton halftime speech for sure.
Yeah ... Taylor Swift's mascara was probably running at this loss...!!
"I wished the eagles would have kept their knees on the necks of the chiefs. That's why you have to stay humble. I kept telling everyone yes, the chiefs would get to another superbowl. But it is set up to humiliate them. They palyed around and found out that all year long, they've played subpar teams and didn't face one true talented team from the NFC. They entered into the biggest game with a false sense of hope and were rewarded with embarrassment."
i knew KC was gonna lose when i saw Travis' haircut. when your main star let their hair grows whatever. YOUR TEAM WILL LOSE
Say yes they getting annoying
"What was it this year? 18 minutes of actual play during a 1-hour match and 4-hour programme? ""It's over to your local sponsor"" DURING THE GAME..!!!!!!!!!! Truly ridiculous. Super Bowl 172 Million.WORLD CUP IN FOOTBALL. Over 3 BILLION... I suppose they are WORLD Champions now, even though it is USA Teams only just like The WORLD Series Of Baseball featuring just American teams. Farcical and Deusional..."
didnt watch this cuz of the time difference but i woke up happy to see the result
"The story was a sack, interference and the defensive line."
Stayed up from 1am in Eswatini/Swaziland and I'm glad I stayed up for a Philly win
1:10 The refs weren't even trying to beat the allegations lmao. I'm so glad the Eagles broke the game wide open even the refs couldn't rig it hard enough.
Eagles D line with surgical precission
Why is this even called football? Isn't this just Rugby with protective gears?
The reaction across the country after that BS OPI told the league they better play the rest of the game straight
Im actually shocked the refs didnt start calling phantom penalties since KC was losing. Such a relief to let the players play
Finally the security guy got his revenge.
"Get Ready guys, new Tay Sway break-up song incoming"
I like the part where Mahomes got sacked.
"Thank god the Eagles won the Swift-Bowl, errrr Super-Bowl."
"I dont know about you, Chiefs scored twenty twoooo oo oooo."
Chiefs didn't belong in the Superbowl. Bills ot Texans would of out a better fight. See what happens when the refs don't help them.?
"I predicted that if the Eagles kept a ""spy"" on Mahomes ( which I've NEVER seen Mahomes getting sacked times ..!!) they would win the Super Bowl...!! Congrats Eagles...a well deserved W...!! And a well deserved season...!! Hurts, Barkley, and especially the Eagles defense ...!!"
"It's crazy and a testament to Mahomes talent, that deep down, even in the last quarter, something in the back of my mind thought ""Yeah, he can totally do this!"""
"Other than Chief's fans, the rest of the country was rooting for the Eagles. People were tired of seeing the Chiefs get another Super Bowl win. The Eagles played a near perfect game."
Good teams score points off turnovers. That kept the Chiefs offbalance for 3 quarters. Impressive win by the Eagles.
Fm Should the game makers create this game anyway fm25 has been canceled
Announcers were absolutely terrible for a super bowl!
Hopefully Taylor Swift quits music after this KC performance
Ohhh so *THATs* what a Chiefs game without referee interference looks like
"as a commanders fan, i don't feel as bad now. the eagles are the real deal, and kc didn't do much better against them than we did. but why all the youtube ads? it was the superbowl, for pete's sake! it was television! and still i get blasted with youtube ads. isn't anything sacred?"
Mahomes' 3 turnovers basically gave the Eagles 17 points.
A bad day for a Scammer pat
The halftime show should be stopped.
Chiefs got SPANKED!
Game was over in the 2nd Q.
Words cannot describe how satisfying this is to watch Patrick Mahomes sacked so many times !
Congrats eagles the champions
I wonder how many people betted on KC to win and Vegas was like naw will payout way less if PHI wins. KC literally looked like they didn't even know how to play football for 3 quarters. wtf put mahomes in TB company. Slap yourself.
"Before the half, eagles had 24 points, chiefs had 0 points and 14 yards."
The refs carried them and dropped them off here. The storyline and ratings needed a boost
Mahomes got blown out in two Superbowls. Never happened to Brady
The only national game (final) where the halftime entertainment is more important than the main event.
Mahomes is a FRAUD!
The first time I ever bet and it was for the chiefs. But it ended up being most humiliating loss in their recent career. Worse luck ever and never betting again
"Der erste unpolitische Super Bowl, endlich geht es wieder um Sport. Hoffe das Deutschland diese Wende auch schafft !!!"
16:12 For those of you that love seeing Mahomes get proper smacked.
"I can't believe what I just saw. Mahomes delivering his worst game ever and the Eagles defense being absolute monsters on each play. What a game by the Eagles, I have nothing against the Chiefs but I'm happy a team finally beat them and in an amazing way !"
eAgLeS
Imagine keeping a team out of the superbowl with a fix to find out you were going to loose the superbowl with a fix. Thats what happens when the league finds out you ran 10+ million fans out of the league.
That was so satisfying
I love watching the chiefs get pounded after their bs calls all year lol refs could save them that time lol. sheeeesh
"This is my first time watching this sport, is the game score supposed to be this different? Or this is just an exception?"
This should be called throw-ball.
Am I the only person feels like this was the WWE Super Bowl
"87?? , ,"
Defense!!!
Watching the smug chiefs lose brings me joy and warmth
Stupid Game
"""Mahomes preSSURED AGAAIIIN"" was the phrase of the game."
Mahomes change de mtier sale tocard
"I don't know anything about Gridiron, and didn't watch the game, but the fact that an Aussie guy won the Super Bowl is big news over here in Australia. Is he the first foreigner to win a Super Bowl? Well done Jordan!"
"I'm not a huge follower of NFL and American Football overal, but even I can acknowledge that defensive effort!"
Mahomies had the worst game of his life yet
"There have only been two SB blowouts in the last 10 years, both times it was KC getting dusted. Not as easy when Mahomes gates sacked and there's not three flags in the air before he goes down."
Good job Philly wouldn't let Patrick get started till the end of the third 35 to 7 game over!!!
Taylor Swift got them to the Super Bowl so the refs could now call a fair game. And guess what happens. BLOWOUT
AJ Brown tonight
"Thank God for that. Can't take much away from the Chiefs in the previous seasons, but they really weren't the best team this season. A few were more deserving of the trophy and Philly definitely deserved that!"
let's go eagles. fly high eagles.
Philadelphia FREEDOM!
The must not have paid the refs enough this time. Outstanding performance by the Eagles!
Lol the Tom Brady Curse is real for chiefs fans lol
Sad to see Travis Swift lose
Sick of this all glory to god bs these football people adhere to. Yea i guess i d believe in such nonsense if i made a million bucks a minute
"Offence gets the glory, but defence wins games! SIX sacks on Mahomes was just awesome to watch! The Philly D-line just straight ran through the Chiefs & when the Chiefs D-line tried to blitz, Hurts just ran it straight down the middle!"
"Glad to see mahomes getting pressured, defences give him too much respect lying off him Philly showed defences how to play him"
No threepeat today mfs
"As an Eagles fan, cant wait to hear the commentators talk about how they doubted the Eagles and how Mahomes cant be stopped."
"Enjoy ur victory chiefs haters cry babies,chiefs will be back and this time we going 10 peat"
Well done Eagles
Redemption is sweet
Kunda shows how the afc is slowly getting worse and worse somehow
13:10 what a throw and definitely a well sought out catch .As much as I detest Philly they tore a new a hole in the chiefs absolutely ravaged that defense line them boys fina have bad dreams for weeks congrats eagles.
"As an eagles fan, we fired on all cylinders. They tried to gameplan around Saquon and we made them pay. Great game for the eagles, why not keep the whole staff and win more"
All year the Chiefs was not all that good they won by luck
every touchdown Kansas City had their Oline was holding on for dear life
"That's a wrap. Great season everybody. Absolutely fabulous. To all fans whose teams did not even make it to the playoffs, enjoy mediocrity. Browns fans, you know what to do"
anyone notice Smith throw an absolute dime to the ref?? 13:11
What a beautiful game. Fly Eagles Fly.
Fly Eagles Fly
I love Jalen
Never Ever seen the chiefs play this bad.. wonder what happened
1-1 in superbowls.. on to next year
6:23
The Eagles did everything they had to do to win this game.
"REMINDS ME OF TAMPA GAME ,CHASING MAHOME DOWN..."
"They got the slapping, they deserved! At this point I am just angry that the Chiefs even made it to the SB instead of the Bills. Buffalo wound not have underdelivered like that..."
I cant understand this game...how to you judge if a player is talented or not?They are all just running and throw passes..
"As a Broncos fan, I LOVED THIS GAME"
"Eagles are dynasty Killers ( pats, now chiefs )"
"I won $50 on this game, thanks Philadelphia"
"Wow, that's a complete blowout. Im shocked. I can't wait for the Eagles next superbowl next year. Go eagles."
Hahahahhahahahahahhahahahahaha
Chiefs finally face a great opponent and show who they really are a bunch of scrubs barely winning all year long i bet they go get tyrek now they need real great receivers out there not aging stars and more help on the line bith defense and offense but kc couldn't even get help from the refs this game just way to good the eagles for kc to over come with refs help.lol
After that first pass offensive interference call on the first drive.. the nfl knew they had to pull the plug on the cheating and play the game normally. It was too blatant. If the cheifs won at all people would have referred to that play the rest of time
"When I saw that AJ Brown OPI call at the start, I thought ""here we go again with these refs"" but on behalf of all fans THANK YOU EAGLES"
Finally screw Mahomes!!
The eagles defence was incredible tonight mahomes couldnt breathe . Congrats to the eagles
NFL is not my national sport but it sure feels good knowing the eagles got that W
thank you eagles 2025 just got better!!!!! fly eagles fly!!!
"Welp i guess america crying fans and fake media kno now the NFL is not rigged..chiefs will be back and this time there will will plenty tear, that u can take to bank"
"Hard for Mahomes to pass Brady now after 2 SB crushing defeats, 2 defeats to Brady in the playoffs, and a series of average regular seasons. Doesn't look like winning a regular season MVP any time soon either..."
USA BABY... We are COMING BACK! !!FREEDOM!
"The gamblers were all gagged/bound, and tossed into a closet until the game ended. No gambling = fair game."
how you meant to win a super bowl if you can't throw or receive
Attack wins you game defense wins you trophy simple as that The eagles defense was very calm and intelligent
Absolute domination!
STEELERS still best dynasty with 4 wins in 6 years.
"Was that Mahomes or Sam Darnold? Rigged, 3rd and 17 you run and the crowd booing the Chiefs is PROOF!"
You see the real chiefs when the refs dont cheat
Congratulations to the Eagles. Their defense was incredible.. They desserve this great Win
Vous ete null les knasas city
No more Brady vs Mahomes talk. Mahomes got blown out twice in the Superbowl.
i guess mahomes will not visit his old grandpa in hospital no more. i am glad they lost
Love how Philadelphia Eagles
"""I don't like this, I don't like that either."" What a mediocre speakers..."
Wow! This wasn't even close.
"WOW, its weird when the refs ACTUALLY call the game correctly and somehow they do t win! Hmmm. Weird"
Mahomes had a nightmare
The world is healing
Swifties got wrecked.
Idemo orlovi
The same people hating on the chiefs and mahomes now are the sons and lil bros of the people who hated on the pats and Brady. Success always brings hate.
Did Pep Guardiola became the headcoach of the Chiefs?
Love
KCs O-line im-PENETRABLE!
It a shame the NFL put the Chiefs in this game. Would have been nice to see what the Josh Allen and the Bills could have done
Did you know that eagles used the same defensive scheme of buccaneers 2020 team
"Some American crazy sport, they are the only ones watch this nonsense."
"The Eagles playing backup's at the end of it all, in a Superbowl, is an embarrassment of huge note for the Chiefs. Can't get any worse than that, seriously."
I just don't understand this game
", ."
Eagles next season need to change the pants to green be dope as hell match the jersey
Hot take: This wasn't Patrick's fault. It was everyone around him
"2nd quarter was devastating! Eagles made The Chiefs look like a bunch of average players who bottled their first SP, not the two time defending champs. Well done Eagles."
"Finally, the BETTER TEAM WON"
"The Chiefs looked like they didn't practice. Like what was that? Also, this scoreboard on the TV was not it."
"Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles on Winning their Second SuperBowl, the Team that has beaten two Elite Quarterbacks and they are Tom Brady and now Patrick Mahomes."
6:30 White boyz up
Stupid yank sport
BLOW OUT WIN.... ! CONGRATS TO THE EAGLES.....!!! KAW KAW !!. FLY .. EAGLEFLY!......
Blatant obvious holds on KC every play.
"This sport to me rn is so dumb, the whole video and time in the video correlates to starting play if you get touched repeat the cycle... i.e. @4.14sec he is on the ground now restart the whole process at that point... instead of attempting to steal and scrum for the ball... I dont get it, I will watch more to try and understand the game but to me rn it looks like a game of set pieces no action just pause play pause play"
Its time for real athelets to stand up for how hard u been working for. And lets put this people. On hes place.
IS THERE ANYWHERE ON EARTH TO ACTUALLY WATCH THE GAME AGAIN WITHOUT A STUPID SUBSCRIPTION OR A DVR?
Bro Mahomes
Mahomes played tonight. Or only his EGO?
Oh no the perfect and sexy patrick mahomo got hit.
On the year of the Snake babyfor Kobeeeeeee
Jake Elliott thankfully did not sell the Super Bowl
Even sleeping with Taylor swift won't make you feel good after that team performance..well done eagles
"The only way this could have been better would be a goose egg for KC. Happy day, oh happy day!!!!"
"Love how in the NFL at the end of games coaches and QBs meet and congratulate each other. Super dope! Something LeBron would never do, in the NBA"
Rigged
This a shame
Kinda stupid that they play safe in final quarter but end up giving up a tonne of points. Should have just played normally and put 60 on them.
Cooper Dejean age 22 first Super Bowl ring . And a picks six ball start his collection.
Mahomes gave this chip to Eagles.
"First time watching American football and I love it!! Came here for Kendrick Lamar, but this sport is also fun and so athletic!"
"Eagles looked too strong in playoffs , what a powerhouse"
Eagles saved the NFL last night... Love it.
Kansas city fans in disbelief the refs did such a bad job at fixing this game.
Thank God I finally didn't see the couple Kelce and Swift celebrating the Superbowl
Eagles are Super Bowl champions again! Best team in the nfl by far this year!
Kansas city en sueur
most of them
I love the Chiefs fans who spent thousands of dollars to attend just to watch their hermit the frog voice actor of a QB get shafted in front of the whole country
All sports at these point are fix
What exactly is ABlitz?
What a stupid game !. If Americans had some decent sports they wouldn't be attracted to supporting wars.
they realy diserved it. played much much better! Defence ruled and offence performed
This was the biggest blowout I've ever seen in any superbowl to be honest lol probably the chiefs worst game in years as well and it couldn't have come at a worse time for them
Phi win
Last 2 TDs by the chiefs was pathetic. Nothing but plsying back ups. Eagles won 50+ 0
The script writers commentators look dumb now.
defense still wins championships! chiefs d did stop barkley tho kinda disappointed he didnt show out.
"Everything about this game was just glorious. The interceptions, the sacks, Philadelphia was America's Team tonight. Good overcame evil....female napoleon dynamite and her pet kelce were defeated."
Dude..@15:43
Bro that scoreboard is wild
"Ive been a Cowboys fan first and NFL fan second since the early seventies and the Eagles won the game the way I and my brother discussed- blow the Chiefs out, get a huge lead and make the refs a non-factor."
"OH J.Hurts MVP , Congrtas Birds and whole Team, Fly EAGLES Fly"
That first catch should have been unnecessary roughness by KC but
The Mighty Mahomo is taken down by the peoples team
That was a beating for the Chiefs for about 58 minutes of the game. Eagles did a great job shutting down Mahomes and the Chiefs offense. 5 sacks makes a big difference in a game.
I love watching all the hate on Mahomes its so funny
Not even allowed to celebrate or talk without 26 camera stuffed in their face 0.02 seconds after the game finished.
Taylor Swift must be really pissed about the loss on her investment
Hey andy...where your kids at?
15:58 surprised this wasnt a roughing the passer
"America thanks the Eagles . Cheating all year shouldnt be rewarded, Chiefs shouldnt have been in this game to begin with . Thank you Philly !!!"
"If Post Malone ""had some help"", another Malone maybe need some"
"As an eagles fans , this game was awesome what a game fly eagles fly"
I. Think it was a fair game because the refs who were at the afc championship game werent there
"As a newcomer, watching the highlights of this game is insane, what a defense from the Eagles, is that quality in defense common or is it extremely rare ? To the point where one of the best QBs in the game can't develop his plays and gets intercepted a lot ?"
"I had big job Saturday night so i was sleeping and missed Superbowl but this video showed me everything i had to see, so cool! Thanks for this great video!"
Kc vs phi 0 /17
This is Cheep version real sport rugby
"""Hurr Durr no refs"" Maybe give the Eagles their flowers for a dominant performance instead of acting like the Chiefs were never good?"
"Resign Sweat and Bau, draft the rest"
where is Tin?????
this is the most boring type of sports...
It's like the lead commentary his KCf fanboy
Mahomes spent too much time on shampoo commercials while everyone else was working on their game
"Eagles curb stomped the KC Queefs, even the refs couldn't help them."
KC are verry bad recievers
Ma quelli della tasca di Mahomes sono del mestiere?
They didn't defeated chiefs they destroyed them
*Playing a Teams Backup in Super Bowl is absolutely mental mate!*
Boring Super Bowl ever
lame ...
"HURTS, put the Hurt on kansas city chiefs ....GOOD JOB! And best super Bowl game EVER!!!!!!, with all the drama going on in this country its so nice to have something positive to cheer about and uplift peoples spirits, unless your a Chief's fan.."
Rigged game
Tom Brady is a great analyst. Dude is good at everything I'm starting to think
Im very happy that the Eagles won
"I'm texting before have time, if Patrick Mahomes continues to play like he did in the first half game over Eagles are going to win .... The defense can only do so much GO CHIEFS"
After those 2 sacks and 1 intercept in the second quarter - no way Mahomes could get his mind straight and play well... the Eagles defense knew exactly what Mahomes and the other guys were going to do - they were there just waiting for the play to do their job. Excellent defense coordinator and preparation for this game.
Congratulations Eagles! Well deserved win!
So boring
"Wow, the commissioner picked philly to be ""champions"", who gives a f**k."
Eagles defense was HELLA IMPRESSIVE!!!! Im a slight hater as a cowboys fan but real recognize real.
Im happy for Philly Dilly to demantling Kansas City Cheats
Marked safe from a Chiefs 3 Peat ....
Cooper DeJean was brutal bro !!
The commentators are funny
"Not really an Eagles fan, but for a while alllll you heard was that Barkley was not having a good night.? THEY STACKED THE BOX against the run so Hurts would have to throw. Which he pretty easily did. Chiefs were overmatched."
WOW!!!
Is giving your kid a ridiculous name the safest way to ensure theyll get drafted in the NFL?
Pressure
So glad that Godell realized how that first penalty call and the plan to rigged the game to secure the three peat would have destroyed the credibility of the NFL and made the call to the refs to call a fair game.
Shouts out to JAKE ELLIOT.
The chiefs got outplayed.
Thanks Philly from a Steelers Fan
I am just excited that the cameras did not cut to Taylor Swift every 10 seconds.
Great game ! And Im a bears fan lol
I knew the Eagles would win. I watched the halftime show and went to bed. It's nice knowing beforehand.
The people who run the NFL are geniuses. This was a repeat of the LA/Patriots SB. Backlash and then the team doesn't show up at all for an ez win. Fan applause both times.
Never seen Mahomes abused like this. Sheesh!
"THE REFS AND NFL CAN""T EVEN SAVE YOU ANYMORE BYE BYE KANSAS CITY"
"No wonder the game was free on Tubi. It was a boring affair, and having the President, who is a disgrace to our nation, in attendance only made it worse."
I love the Eagles. Great night.
"A huge well done to the Eagles on their win, their defence was outstanding in shutting down the Chiefs offence. Well deserved Super Bowl Champions."
"It's alaways a good day when the KC Chiefs lose, see you in Cancun Kelce and Mahomes"
"No matter how flashy and finesse the game may get, the motto is still the same: football is won between the trenches. Period."
The Chefs got cooked
Too big to rig!!!
Eagles defence made sure we didnt see a lot of Taylor Swift
I guess people can stop whining about KC getting preferential officiating
That has to be the best Eagles team to ever take the field
Play some real football!
GG to the eagles fans. They played an insane game. We'll get em next year man
Chiefs were still lucky because it Saquon would've had himself a game on top of all this the score wouldve been 70-0 easily
thank you philly eagles! THANK YOU!
"WOW, the Eagles destroy the Chiefs in pretty much every part of the game."
"this game proves that the the offensive/defensive lines can win championships. hurts was amazing, and the recievers, but the OLINE was also great.. the whole philly defense was amazing, but the defensive line giving mahomes panic attacks, cause a whole bunch of awful throws"
Angels in the out field rulesyou gotta win championships yourself no help
That Eagles Defensive line is MVP
Chiefs got slaughtered
"Happy for Barkley & Hurts, smith and that O line They worked hard for it"
Patrick Mahomes *BEST* Super Bowl performance since Super Bowl 55
Philly steps up again to save us from the next dark empire (after beating Brady and his Cheatriots in 2017)
"Hurts >>>>> Mahomes. Mahomes and KC are overrated, even Joe Burrow is better"
Go Birds till it aint Go Birds no more
Thank you Eagles!! Guess the Queefs couldnt pay off the refs this time....
16:15 Jalen Carter slapped the outta Mahomes
Crazy to watch Mahomes get sacked back to back and then Jalen Hurts just sprints out of the pocket like it's nothing lol
15:44 I can watch this all day. what a terrible game from mahomes
"Mate so many blunders from Mahomes, in a crucial game like this"
Chiefs fan I dont wanna hear anything about Jalen hurts or the eagles anymore until mahomes beats us in another bowl
"I LOVE the Eagles defense! At times this year, they carried the team. However, if the Eagles didn't have the best defense in the NFL, the final score of the SB is just closer and the Eagles still win. Hurts is QB1 and that dude, Saquon reminded haters he can block and catch the ball (kinda lol) too, and the Eagles' 3rd best receiver, Dotson, is a number 1 on many teams! Fly Eagles Fly. I'll be watching these highlights for years."
Beyond absolutely stunning game
Patrick looked lost out there. Crazy
No 3 peat.! Haha
Chiefs oline was getting bullied man handled all type of ways I see why they lost gj eagles from a Vikings fan and from dc
3 peating is tough. Not everyone is MJ. He did it twice. My Lord!
I found more entertainment watching the puppy bowl
E A G L E S EAGGLESSSS FLYYYYY EAGLES FLYYYYYY
Seems like the ref finally sided towards the Eagles.
Lets go Egaless!!!
"this was my first superbowl i watched live (i'm from italy), and staying up till 4 am to see the chiefs lose was worth everything!"
Ha hahaha ha hahaha Chiefs lose Eagles win I love I love it
"Ngl, I do feel bad for Mahomes"
The almighty mahomo go once again whiped over the flor. Goat huh?
The curse of 15 wins is true anyway.
The Chiefs shown as the sham most BS carried team in the league. The refs couldn't help you tonight and you deserved to loss. No 3peat and Taylor Swift was sent home unhappy thank god!! Screw the chiefs!!
"KC Abandoned the running game, was non existent, add the continuous pressure from The Eagles D And That was It smh... Philly really showing Teams Mahomes weakness... Maybe they'll pay attention!"
FLY EAGLES FLY!
Be proud Eagles Fans - Totally Deserved from a Rams fan - you schooled them
hurts can throw some absolute DARTS
"What happened to Mr. ""Clutch""?"
I don't like neither team but I'm glad to see Philly win
We down here in australia have been waiting all year for this ..... thankyou eagles.
Hated to see the Chiefs get gifted with another SB berth but the destruction at the hands of the Eagles made it worth it.
well i see the Eagles' highlights. where is the Chiefs' highlights....different video?
Fly eagles fly
The worst game chiefs ever they play so bad
congratulations EAGLES NICE WIN CONGRATULATIONS
Tom Brady is better than Patrick
That last td to worthy was one hell of a ball.
"jalen was always the better QB, FLY EAGLES FLY"
So the Green Bay Packers are still the only NFL team to ever 3-peat. And they have done it twice.
Patrick is not Mahome boy
"You can clearly see that the NFL didn't like the people talking about how KC has been helped for way too long, they didn't like that tickets weren't getting gobbled up quick, people were going to boycott therefore this happened the zebras weren't even throwing flags for touching Fagtrick Mahomo"
Kenny Pickett kneeling in victory formation - just like we envisioned in 2022...
.. .
"The Eagles have a lot of guys who deserved this win. I did not expect a blow out, but I knew that the Eagles were going to be the hungrier team. The Chiefs offense has been pretty bad all year. We all know TB12 loved to see this haha"
Eagles Offensive Line And Defensive Line Dominates The Chiefs All Night Long.
Chiefs not scoring until last 30 seconds in 3rd quarter. Pretty insane.
6:11 Cooper DeJean will remember this play the rest of his life. This was the play that really put momentum permanently on the side of the Eagles in this game.
Davonte Smith is just a winner
I support Eagles since Hotel California
Probably one of my favorite Super Bowl even though they arent my teams its still sooooo nice to see chiefs lose
This was no contest. The Chiefs never stood a chance. Patrick Mahomes had the worst game of his career.
Eagles def was something else tonight.
"Ngl Im slightly disappointed that one of the Eagles defensive players didnt get Super Bowl MVP because they were the reason this game was won. hurts played really well and obvs was a deserving recipient but that defence was electric. Also - is this game enough for us all to stop with the refs in the Chiefs pocket nonsense? The Chiefs got here on merit, so did the Eagles, the Eagles won because they were the better team. Saying the Chiefs didnt win because the refs called a fair game and didnt help the Chiefs out is doing MASSIVE disservice to how well the Eagles actually played"
Demolition job.
It was like watching the beat down Tampa gave the Chiefs a few years ago all over again Sweet!
The ref did not cheat for the Chiefs thats a clean football. Thats how it should be Port Taylor Swift. Should you get what she wants with her boyfriend Kelsey boo-hoo should go to hell and ride along with the Chiefs good rich jackasses.
This the team that people said wouldnt survive in the AFC
I really love how the raft sled Patrick Mahomes toss the ball beyond the line of scrimmage what the heck
Patrick is special but never compare this guy to Brady again. Its ridiculous. Credits to Philly. Im happy for Saquon man.
"wait on that bomb to adams the chiefs had one hand in there, shouldnt they be calling that an interception"
Never thought Chiefs would ever get manhandled like this. The shock will linger for a while.
"Attacco Chiefs imbarazzante, una squadra cos messa male al Super Bowl poche volte l'ho vista !|"
Def gotta be thrown to a spread under 20 for max betting payouts...
"Hurts > Burrow, Herbert, Tagovailoa! Well done Eagles! The best D-line and O-line in the league."
"Hurts with that, through, deserves millions for that"
Mahones should be renamed Burlap... he got so many SACKS
It Hurts so much.
~ Don OLD Duck .... everything he touches dies ....
This is kinda what it would look like if one team got dragged into the super bowl by the refs but the other earned its spot. Oh.. wait...
Taylor swift fans in red
They have been abused lol! Good for Phily
I bet Jason was proud of the Eagles tonight!
"Eagles coach went from ""will be fired"" to super bowl champion. Tells you how much these analysts know."
Lets face it THE DEFENSE won the game and the MVP
Refs not protecting Mahomes and calling soft fouls for Mahomes and actually calling the sack
I didn't necessarily agree with how the eagles got the job done but they got it done anyway i want to congratulate them on getting the job done but I wanted to see my team the green bay packers get it done but at same time I am happy the eagles got it done
"This is what happens when you make deals with the devil, he collects at the worst possible time"
"Thank god Philly won, so tired of KC winning every year."
I'm not an eagles fan but I was glad that they won because the Chiefs are very overrated. And I was extremely happy that this game didn't turn into the Taylor Swift show.lol
Start to learn something about this game just because messi watched
Forget the final score - 34-0
"The Bucs recipe, from a few years ago, is great: get to Patrick and let him run for his life!"
Tom and Gronk never had a performance this atrocious. The Goat QB and TE ends now.
Heard that Travis was suppose to propose if chiefs won
Jalen Cater commands the double and them Dawgz go hunt
Kenny picket got superbowl reps hell yeah
Absolute dominance
"""I hate the fckn Eagles Man"".. (The DUDE jeff Lebowski)"
Kelce has to retire now.
I loved seeing Tom Brady's heart break after literally promoting the Chief's.
congrats eagles...whoopie...
Catch up Iggles. 5>2
From a Cleveland Browns fan....THANK YOU EAGLES
"From a Denver Broncos fan,,thanks Philly,.."
The eagles put straight BTA
Giants - hmmm Saquon or Daniel Joneslets go with Daniel jones on max contract
"tom brady saying he dont like the calls being made lol, he seeing how we used to feel about him gettin away with everything"
Seems like Taylors Eras Tour finally ended
Looks like the chiefs aint pay the refs this year
"Well done Eagles, what an overall dominant performance against the best team in recent years. PM did well to come back late and get points on the board. But Eagles defence was mighty."
This is one of the most satisfying Super Bowls of my life. Thank you Eagles.
The eagles stayed on the mission. Never lost focus
Im surprised that the refs didnt call roughing the paser on the sacks against the eagles got on mahomes
kansas city need an decent qb and they coulda won.. useless fool couldnt even evade linemen he was gettin constantly put on his arse.
"15:41 favorite play of the year, hands down."
Mchomes threw the game
Congratulations to the Eagles
Chiefs Fans mad
Snore
Rigged
6:20 that block was so needed
BYE BYE KANSAS SHITTY
fly birds fly
Patrick Mahomes is 0-3 in the postseason when Tom Brady is involved in the game!
Too strong this eagles for chiefs....
This is what happens when the Chiefs don't get the BS calls they got all season long...
"5:28 So, I'm French. No precise idea whatsoever of the rules, could anyone please explain to me why was the kick taken again ? It seems the Chiefs' player is starting to push to soon (like in a rugby scrum ?) and isn't allowed to, but then it would be a chiefs' fault. So why would they cancel the field goal although it succeeded ?"
Cooper Dejean first player to score a touch down in super bowl history on his birthday.
Jalen is overrated
Message to Kermit TB 12 is the GOAT .
Strange american game
conference finals be the main event
Only thing that was worse than the Chiefs tonight was that god awful scoreboard. Whoever greenlit that needs to be fired.
"Congratulations, Eagles!"
I don't know anything about this sport but thank you Eagles!
The Chiefs spent all their time focusing on stopping Saquon that they forgot about every other pro bowl-level talent they have on offense
"well deserved Super Bowl Champion, not only with regards to this game. The entire season was very, very strong. Chiefs were struggling the entire season."
congrats Eagles
"I dont watch NFL, I dont know the rules, but as a rugby fan.....wouldnt it be much better without the helmets and padding, just saying. Anyways, all ive been hearing about is Mahomes this, Mahomes that. In my very humble opinion, looking at this video, I think the Eagles absolutely smashed KC, and looked to take out the QB at every opportunity. That smash and grab at 15.47, just goes to show their defence won this game."
"Someone please explain how 5:30 is a false start on the center. Didnt understand live and still dont now. Feel like I know ball pretty well and it just doesnt make sense, defense jumps, O-lineman reacts, ball gets snapped. Defensive offsides penalty declined?"
rewatching the first half at 3 am absolutely a dream. wow man. 34-0 rn. absolute art by my *champions* go birds
Watching this is sooooo satisfying.. The first two flags were rediculous.. but the REFS can't help the Chiefs this time around.
11:54 Look at the effort by Kelce during this play. Truly inspiring.
Chiefs are 3-0 with the refs and 0-2 without. Who knew
Wanjir...D-Line nya Eagles kacau abis! Congrats Eagles!
And gronk did it again thank you for supporting chiefs this year
started locking in at the 4th quarter
Most boring superbowl in history. Didnt even watch it.
KC got their second first down of the game in the 3rd quarter! Insane defensive effort.
When the first time mahomes is able to connect with Kelce is on the 3rd quarter you know the chiefs have been shut down
"Knew all along that if the refs didnt cheat for KC like they been, they would get blown out. KC actually had no business being in this game. Their entire season was gift wrapped"
cry like them
Mike Vick needed this win
I Am So Ashamed Of The Nfl Referees. I mean You Carry A Team All Season Long.Then You Just Abandoned The Zebra's. All That Money The Zebra's Paid Out. Well The Deal Was To Help Get The Zebra's To The Superbowl.
I dont really understand the game but by god that was a beautiful display
Gotta love Kelce all frustrated and pissed off. #cheatinazzchiefs got exposed like no other in this one. And the world loved it.
I think Jalen hurts got in mahomes ear and promised him free Philly cheesesteak from a restaurant of his choosing if he threw the game
Nope! Something is very strange when KC doesnt score. I call bs. The Eagles are my favorite. But this had to be set up
Im from kansas city and root for the chiefs but ill respect the eagles for ever ! They deserve it you cant always win
Chiefs had nothing going for them. Mahomes was shut down! The Eagles made them look like chumps. Its clear that the Eagles did their homework while the Chiefs were clearly not ready for the most important game of the year
Now you see what happens to KC when the Refs do their job correctly without favortism.
The fact that they didnt let saquon get a TD is crazy
THE EAGLES ARE THE SUPER BOWL LIX CHAMPS!
That defense made Mahomes look like a highschool kid against grown boys. Merciless
"From a Manchester United fan, THANK YOU EAGLES!"
"That is what happens when DJT is around. Crazy, stupid stuff."
where is taylor swift? where is travis kelce????
Funny how a team can win when they 12th player is taken out nfl is fixed just like boxing and gambling
Chiefs offensive line was like that Oreo cookie you keep in the milk for to long when your about to eat it breaks and crumbles back into the milk never to be seen again!!!! The real stars was Eagles the defense they were lights out they gave them nothing all night very impressive.
I Loved watching that Patrick Mahomes Lowlight tape.
Brady has 7 rings.
"the fake bowl, no one beleeds this stuff anymore, just boomers"
padding the Kickers stats is such a dope move ngl
Pitiful game ! Except for the Eagles ! Chiefs seemed lifeless
Jordan Mailata was a BRICK WALL
I should not have betted on the chiefs
Eagle defense win the game
"Chiefs didn't deserve to be there, this just proves it."
Grosse squad dfensive ct eagles. Les chiefs ont manqu dalternance pour poser des pb aux Eagles avec un running back
(Two words. Roll Tide!!! Hurts & Smith two of Bamas best doing their best!)
Jerry must be kicking himself. Dallas could have picked Hurts with the 51st pick in the second round but passed. Eagles took Jalen two picks later and the rest is history.
Now Jason Kelce gets to celebrate while Travis gets sad. Year of Taylor Swift has come to an end.
"Wow, that was a beatdown. Eagles manhandled them"
Most boring sport in the world how people enjoy it stopping every 10 seconds just so they can add a few ads in there
Eagles
17:37 did i miss something about onside kicks
I don't ever wanna hear a word about Maholmes being better then BRADY AGAIN..... Getting beat like this..he should be ashamed.....BRADY NEVER GOT DID LIKE THIS BEFORE BRADY IS THE GOAT ...No more Discussion
It really Hurts
American Footbal most stupid boring game ever
Poor chiefs
"Robbery, Chiefs shouldve won"
a skunk
This happens when the refs dont help
MAHOMIE SACKED AGAIN! it!
This convinces me that 9ners should have won that superbowl both times they played chiefs
No 3 peat
Cam Newton superbowl 15:56 moment
Cant remember the favs getting beaten like this. Sacks and interceptions kept coming. What an impressive defense.
"The Eagles just monsterd them, Where was Mahomess protection, How many times was he sacked? The Chiefs just didnt turn up.. Up the Eagles"
"Now if Harbaugh can watch this tape and make the Ravens play like the Eagles when they face the Chiefs, that be nice"
I kept thinking chiefs were going maybe come back till hit 34
Great game! Magnificent Sport!
MaHomes go make some more BORING commercials....
Mahomie is SACK! it!
Eagles were truly brilliant defensively and well organized offensive plays credits to Hurts but Mahomes except that 50 yds throw he wasn't good enough this night
"What a disappointing game man (for neutral fans), it was a no contest win. Glad I didn't stay up to watch it live (Im european)"
This game reminded me of the Chiefs vs bucs a few years ago
make this top comment because.. FLY. EAGLES. FLY!!!
Bravissimi Eagles ! Complimenti
13:03 what a throw insane
"This is the real Patrick that we are seeing. No bias calls, no help from the refs just Patrick being Patrick. Don't wanna hear anyone saying he's the goat. with that performance you all should call him a one and done goat 40 - 22 and 6 sacks. let that sink in for yous."
Wheres that dumb chief song at?
Finally some good news after the abismal season of the 76ers.
DJT must be really upset!
"This shows that the Chiefs didnt have any business being in the Super Bowl. To be frank, they shouldve missed the playoffs. But thanks to the refs they made it THAT far. Lets be honest, the Chiefs were actually one of the worst teams in the NFL in the playoffs."
13:14 see how the ref catches the ball while signaling touchdown
un fel de rugby...
0:57 AJ 2:29 McD 6:38 Cooper 8:29 Septutti
El comentarista en el ltimo anotamiento trag saliva seguro por qu apost a los perdedores
I woke up at 3:30 am to watch this game and it turned out to be a blowout. As a neutral this SB sucked but congrats to the Eagles
Is this the first African American Quarterback to win the Super Bowl? it!
"Please don't mention Patrick Mahomes' name with Tom Brady or Joe Montana, thanks."
"While the Eagles D was insane, Mahomes did nothing today to try and get the game going"
The worst I have seen the Chiefs play
Chiefs need to resign Worthy immediately dude is a legend in the making.
Is this the first African American Quarterback to win the Super Bowl? it!
"Funny how when the refs are called out for helping the Chiefs, suddenly the Chiefs are no good. Almost as if the Chiefs were only good because of the refs"
The rest of the world other than the Chiefs fans thank the Eagles.
Where's the shot of Tay-Tay on the big screen?
Hahahaha the Taylor Swiftbowl didn't show the biotch the whole game. Hahahaha
6:16 is going to go down in history!
Not referees not phone a friend Not ask the audience Help them tonight
"Some ppl got pity s*x, today the chiefs got pity points"
"Remember, the NFL has profit sharing between teams. They are no longer incentivized to help the chiefs once they reach the Super Bowl because the outcome doesnt matter at that point. Its crazy how the chiefs lost as soon as it was no longer in the NFLs best financial interest"
"One of the best defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Vic called a great game, and Hurts kept them going down the field. It ""Hurts"" so good for Eagles fans to win a Super Bowl. The only good thing about that halftime show was that Buick GNX..."
Eagles were cooking them like a cheese steak
That was quite a respectable effort from Chiefs on the 2nd half after Eagles defense made them AFK for the entire 1st half
Just remember....at one time Nick Saban thought Tua was a better QB than Hurts????
Close game for sure
"Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on winning the Superbowl. Also, thank you for getting Kenny Pickett a ring."
I think the Buckeyes could have beaten the Chiefs today.
The thing thats crazy is how Young the Eagles are. Most of them havent hit they full prime. That defense is loaded and offense too with stars who arent even 30 yet
"Talk about dominating,"
Fire everybody on the chiefs
this defense was something else
I'm a buffalo bills fan josh allen and Jalen Hurts both got mvp trophy this year and I'm so glad that the eagles won the supebowl we have two mvp this time except for the Kansas city cheats I mean cheifs couldn't no referees save them this time when deasaun caught that interception that lit a fire under the eagles feet and the didn't let up off the chiefs at all yeah yeah it was game over for the chiefs they gone cry when dey get on the plane
Eagles were clip farming on McDuffie tonight
Smokin on that chiefs pack
At 1 point I wanted to call 911 ....
GO EAGLES!!
"Hey Saban, heres a napkin, wipe your face, theres some black feathers and a beak on your chin."
"the refs tried too, lmao"
"So, it's like Rugby but less physical and with protection"
Mahomes is runing wild just like during the SB with thr bucs. Trying to get his offense on track but the EAGLES DEFENSE won it
"Thats what it looks like, when you aint got seven guys playing for you from the sideline"
Chiefs O line got Exposed every play. Wow. That Eagles D line deserves the Trophy actually.
This win was for kobe Bryant! fly high
all highlights of just the eagles lmfao
that is the moment chiefs learned their lessons
Jalen cant throw. Jalen dont run. Jalen BET!
PLAY LICK BACK BY EST GEE
Kansas City just got in their own way or they just deliberately lost it so badly LUL i think the betting companys win LUL
"well, it seems all the reality show biz surrounding KC took away their bite to some extend."
THE EAGLES ARE THE SUPERBOWL CHAMPS NOW MY SISTER WILL THINK ITS NOT SCRIPTED NO MORE
"A 15-2 regular season team (KC) that should have been 10-7, played like an 10-7 team. Congrats Eagles. Hope that Mayor in Philly has been practicing her spelling."
15:46 was RUTHLESS
Worst Super Bowl I've ever seen 0-34 at the end of the 3rd. This year will be known as the year the refs helped the Chiefs get to the Super Bowl.
Horrible announcer. Turning off.
Philly was out coached & pleaded by the team
"Awesome job, refs"
"Jalen Hurts, replaced by Hawk Tuah in the CFB National Championship game now a Super Bowl Champion. Roll Tide"
GO EAGLES
"What a performance from Philly, Cheifs were absolutely shell-shocked for most the game, the defence was incredible"
Kendrick masterclass and eagles won? sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
"FUgg the 3peat, Cheifs and Cowboy fans tears have been filling up all our cups"
The Eagles deserved to win. The Chiefs got gifted the Super Bowl birth
"As a ravens fan, thank you Philly"
OK NOW can we finally stop trying to compare Mahomes to Tom Brady please?
"I'm Drew Brees.,, Soo happy mahomes didn't get his third straight ring in the dome .. im Drew Brees!"
whole game i kept thinking i was watching the chiefs buccaneers super bowl from 2021
"13:05, a thing of beauty, what a perfect throw"
Chief's got destroyed
phillys defense was the real MVP my goodness that front 4 was STACKED
This is what happens when you actually have to play ball and youre not able to depend on the refs help to win
"From the great words of Dennis Green, Arizona head coach. they are what we thought they were without the referee help"
They got smoked
Watching this as neutrals over here in UK it was hard to stay awake until 3:30am.
The BIRDS are FLYING BABY!
NEVER MENTION FRAUD MAHOMES AND BRADY IN THE SAME CONVERSATION
Funny what happens when you dont have 87 controversial calls going in your favor and you realize your girlfriend is gonna make you sleep on the couch tonight mister Travis.
Ohh so this is American football
NFL is rigged Tom Bradys dad is an NFL FILM PRODUCER who is worth $3 billion
The refs strike again on that Offensive Pass interference
Im glad that I didnt watch the game. It wasnt even close. I slept great during the game. Congratulations Eagles
"So much Chiefs Hate. Enjoy it while it lasts. Brett Veach will fix the OL, Chiefs will be back, haters will hate. Congrats Eagles on a solid win!"
"Its kinda funny watching the chiefs receivers after they score, they get up like theyre going to celebrate then they realize theyre down by 1000 points"
"Its kinda funny watching the chiefs receivers after they score, they get up like theyre going to celebrate then they realize theyre down by 1000 points"
So this is what it looks like qhen the refa reduse to cheat for the chiefs. Hhm. The truth has shown its face now. Lmfao
Crazy how the Seahawks didnt run the ball!
That was a great game
Mahomes was shockingly bad
they only lost cause chiefs got tired of fans complaining about them winning all the time
Thank God
The refs gave them 7 wins this year. This was a 9-8 team against a legit 14-win team. Buffalo should have been here if it wasn't for the refs.
I could make that scorebug in 10 seconds with MS Paint
"KC was the slight favorite somehow, at least at some point, but the Eagles were the obvious meta build this season in a league with a team looking to three peat. Top rated defense, best RB and player of the season, qb bomb and run threat, with an o line that doesn't get enough credit."
Don't ever let the disgraced 47 touch you. Everything he touches is humiliated and destroyed.
Kicket was on his A game all day
"This was very similar to the Bucs Superbowl. Chiefs had no answer to the Eagles defence. Hurts was superb. Refs still giving some awful decisions, but against both teams for a change"
The eagles defense stops trying 4th quarter
Eagles made it too big to rig
NFL fans & viewers oddly satisfied of the result. Good job Eagles!
Almost seemed like the Chiefs walked in thinking it was gonna be a cake walk
CONGRATULATIONS PHILADELPHIA EAGLES!!! WE DID IT!!!! SUPER BOWL CHAMPS!!! GO BIRDS!!!
Goo thing eagles got to acore big early
"It wouldn't as close as the final score indicated, it was a total beatdown defensive mauling and the offense did its job moving the ball and scoring. Congratulations to the Eagles for showing up sword in hand to slay the dragon"
"Mahomes being run over by the Eagles defense have him suffering Super Bowl LV flashbacks ""Oh no, not again"""
This game was rigged
d fence eagles
"Manifesting the NFL finally changes next season the competing teams in the beginning in the video. IT'S GOING TO BE 8 YEARS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST USE THE 2016 ONES IF YOU DON'T WANT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW! If scoreboards change every Superbowl, then why can't the NFL do the same?"
"Wooow the chiefs where absolutley dominated and mahomes threw some bad picks.That eagles defence is crazy.jalen made the throws he had to make.I dont care what anybody says but when have such a stacked roster like the eagles have any competent qb is supposed to get a chip.simple as that ,i aint tryna hear any excuses.Give a very good qb that roster and they dont lose a game most likely all season.Hurts also ran the ball very well and strong.He showed toughness today.Aj brown us on another level. THE DEFENCE is the mvp of the game not really the offence. MAHOMEs was scared the whole night."
We can now stop with this Mahomes is the Goat nonsense!
BTA DHS!!!!!!!!!
Is this the worst throw of a game youve ever seen.
"14:06 Was this called a foul? I don't have access to the full game. I know it doesn't matter in the long run, but Mahomes was clearly over the line of scrimmage when he shoveled the pass forward."
Im Accra Ghana and I have to say Im happy that the nfl is back
"After the game. Illegal winning, eagles. Redo last game."
"man that end-score, and it wasnt even that close"
Congratulations Eagles
Just a reminder Brady never lost a SB by more than 1 score
Taylor swift the new towel hoe for the chiefs
As a New England fan.. thanks Philly
The eagles defense stops trying 4th quarter
I didnt even watch the game cuz i alr knew what the outcome would be
E-A-G-L-E-S!! Eagles!!!!!
Philly pass rush was great. But look at the atrocious pass protection at 6:00. Eagles send 4 passrushers against 7 blockers and the pass pro is just torn to pieces. Borderline unprofessional from the offense. So happy Chiefs were sent packing!
When the bribe check doesnt clear
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
15:45 Hulk Smash!
congrats Eagles WORLD CHAMPS!!!
"Mahomes isn't even too 5. Embarrassing people were trying to compare him to Brady. Dude has been blown out twice in the Superbowl, one of them being against Brady. There is zero, absolutely nothing Mahomes can do to ever supplant Brady as the GOAT now."
"Ive said this the whole season but the Chiefs o line has to be one of the worst in the league League. Up against a good defence they may as well have not even played, giving Mahomes half a second to throw the ball"
"GO BIRD TEAM! signed, a Ravens fan"
The Eagles didnt send more than 4 pass rushers all game. Good God.
This surely has to be the best a team has played in a match all year? To do it in the biggest game truly makes them worthy champions.
Patrick and Travis whoSWEET KARMA
best team ever
i kalled it when i seen chris jones didnt want it said naww he aint een trine
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BIRDSSSSSSSSSSSSS
"Super Bowl parties can be a drag. I had to listen to ignorant people tonight say Barkley didnt do anything tonight. When the other team focuses 7 players on stopping 1 player and nothing else, Barkley is the MVP."
"Chiefs finally play a game this year with unbiased refs and proceed to give us one of the most dominated superbowls in recent memory. Exposed and proof they were never a contender this year, but the nfl needed the swifty viewers throughout the season"
"Up the cheifs, next year boys"
Potus orangutan is a jinx
WOW ...... The Chiefs got SCHOOLED!!!!!!!!!!!!
"As a Chiefs fan, I have to say...hats off to the Eagles. That was one of the most dominating defensive line performances I've ever seen. Amazing contributions from the secondary and Baun as well. The offense and Hurts adjusted very well to Spagnuolo's game plan, and Elliot did a great job when needed. Great game Philly."
Por algo no me gusta mahoms porque es malon
"this super bowl win was as boring as the foles super bowl win was exciting, ying and yang eagles. congrats"
"As an Eagles fan, this was really quite a joke. The eagles clearly came to play. I guess the Chiefs thought the refs would carry them to victory"
Tom Brady needs a new job he is awful.
"Not an Eagles fan but letsgo DeJean!! That such a smart int a he finished it, live to see a pick 6 in the SB!"
The Eagle has landed. Absolutely the best defensive performance. Wow.
lol so all this clownery mahomes goat talk is done now. You can't be a goat and get blown out in 2 super bowls. And 1 of those was to the actual goat Tom Brady. He is HIM.
Look at Carter at 9:38 and 16:00 This dude gotta be co-MVP
Taylor Swift is breaking up with Travis Kelce over the Chief's terrible loss.
"I knew this superbowl would be boring. I knew the Eagles are going to blow out the Chiefs. How? The Chiefs should not have been in the superbowl and not deserving of this year's superbowl. Why? They should have lost in the division series if not for favorable calls going their way. They should have lost in the conference game if not, again for favorable calls. It was so obvious that they are being ushered in to get a chance at a 3-peat and big money maker."
WOW wo wat da hale? pay backs are hale huh?..chiefs made a pick6 in last yr superbowl now the eagles made a pick 6 with da chiefs...how bout dem WHO?..CHIEFS sorriee they starting playing them CHIEFS at the end but they ran out of time..happy new yr mr EGALES..hooopiee js amen peace be unto you but GOD is still no. one and dat aint no monkey business
Eagles said to hell with the script. We rewrote it with... WE ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPS!
I'm gonna miss having Mahomes & company shoved down our throats every 5 minutes selling something.
I love that KC got destroyed
On that first play broccoli could have got hurt
"Bummer for the Chiefs, but I'm also glad that the Eagles won on 3 counts. 1) Saquon Barkley finally got his Super Bowl ring 2) Dallas Goedert is from South Dakota State University out of Spearfish, South Dakota, Happy for him 3) the NFC East A) Eagles B) Cowboys C) Redskins D) Giants Is the only division that can boast to have each team win 2 Super Bowl's by each team"
Everyone always refers to him as Mahomes.besides Tom Brady of course. If people are going to keep glazing Mahomes for his succession at such a young age ? Brady decides to take the Uncle route really just making sure to keep an eye on the kid. All this time during Mahomes career as a Nephew on the fieldUnc finally retires and Patrick has got a possible 3 peat on the table. If the pressure to do the impossible wasnt heavy enough its gotta be refreshing having 1 on 1 interviews with the GOAT during SB week as well as having the pleasure of Uncle Tom overlooking the game from a booth levels above. Little Patrick. Regardless of any outcomes Tom couldnt stress it enough. He always thought Patrick was a good kid. One of the worst QB performance Ive ever seen in a supebowlif not the worst. #FoldedUnderPressure
Defense Wins Championships. and thats a fact.
Thank you eagles
That milton strip sack was crazy
"Color commenter guy should work at waffle house, he's horrible"
What happens when you're a mediocre team helped through the season and playoffs.
The Ravens/Bills went out for this
I was hoping for both teams to lose but I guess I can settle with the Chiefs choking and not getting their three-peat.
It was the defensive pass rush that won that game. They Rattled Mahomes big time.
"Pretty good highlights, except I don't count watching dancing in the end zone is a highlight. At least until the halftime show (and then, being old school, I miss marching bands)."
This is terrible. The SB half-time shows keep getting worse. MSBSGA! Make Super Bowl Shows Great Again!
Shows having a elite defense and a offensive line is everything imma jags fan but I'm glad the Eagles won tired of the zebras helping them every year
I don't want to hear mahomes and brady in the same conversation ever again! TB12 GOAT
Best day ever! - plus Taylor Swift and her satanic cronies getting booed chefs kiss!
Worst superbowl
Thank u eagle as broncos fan u did again stop tom Brady and patrick mahomes
FLY EAGLES FLY
Dam the reign of Terror is really over
Wheres Mahomes mouthy wife?
So satisfying to see chief lose. This is how they play all season without referee help.
Defense Wins Championships! Jalen Hurts is elite! The Eagles are not going anywhere anytime soon!
Game was scripted. PERIOD.
Congrats Eagles that was pure domination. On the other side: That was one of the most boring superbowls of all time.
"This was a phenomenal event seen all around the world!!! By the end of the 2nd quarter, I knew it was all over. Spectacular play and a well done event! Thanks for the memories!!!"
Congratulations Eagles - The AFC
"Lets see next season If Mahomes and KC come back with a vengeance, or if this is a 'passing of the torch' so to speak. Certainly didnt see anyone predicting Eagles blowout win"
"finally someone else wins, whoever is writing these scripts please do the colts next"
Safe to say anyone rooting for the eagles couldnt have asked for a better game
14:13 is this the favorable officiating mahomes is famous for getting?
Ive never seen this defense so good in a while and their offensive and defensive linemen is good also wow
GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED!
Chiefs are/is/were frauds
You cant tell me that didnt feel like broncos vs Seahawks Panthers vs broncos Dfense total control that one gotta sting chiefs
Best defensive performance since the '00 Ravens
EAGLES ARE SB 59 CHAMPS AND THE LOMBARDI TROPHY IS COMING TO PHILLY!!!
And i thought the worst SB id ever watch was the pats v rams in 2019 talk about boring
14:15 isn't that a illegal pass. He was infront of the blue line of scrimmage
Im not a Chiefs fan but 6 sacks 3 interceptions is outlandish. GREAT JOB EAGLES! Glad you guys got to play at Kendrick Lamars concert.
"This was the most defensive overpower in the Superbowl since the Seahawks and the LOB absolutely destroyed Peyton and the Broncos. Thank you Philly, the world is forever gracious. Looks like Travis isn't getting married after all lmfao. FLY EAGLES FLY"
Defend won
When the world realizes the Chiefs probably shouldve couldve been 2-15 during the season.. but NFL carried them to the Super Bowl and Taylor did all she could! But she couldnt carry Mahomes any longer.
The best oline the best dline ... We're built to dominate in trenches on both sides of the ball ... That's where football is truly won ... This could be the best team ever assembled...
"As a ravens fan, thank you Philly"
Complete annihilation
"KC got destroyed by the best defense Ive ever seen. Mahomes was running for his life, Kelce was nowhere, we didnt see Taylor Swift either, outstanding job by General Hertz, he and the whole team deserve it without doubt. Just a fantastic Super Bowl."
This guy ain't no tom Brady how dare people try and say o ye mahomes gonna be the next GOAT there is only one GOAT and there will always be ONE GOAT n that is TOM BRADY
Travis ain't getting any tonight.
"14:12 not that it matters but that shovel pass was beyond the line of scrimmage and should have been a penalty on Mahomes. Of course it doesn't matter now, but I would like to have seen a shutout"
Crazy when the halftime show get more views than the game highlights.
A foot is that part of the body that you put your shoe on. Hard to figure out for the 5% of the worlds population.
Fun fact: mahomo's 0-3 when Brady's in the stadium
Qu raro que Philadelphia va ganando y Kansas en el ltimo cuarto empieza a jugar bien ya NFL s que esto fue arreglado para no perder credibilidad ni prestigio
Waiting for the mic'd up like.....
"Goes to show, d line and o line are the most important."
To be fair hurt dominate chief 2 years ago superbowl Final used to be mvp also chief didn't defeat eagles refs help them 2 fake bs no sense pass inference
"SO SATISFYING TO SEE MAHOMES, KELSEY AND TAYLOR TO LOSE ON THE SUPERBOLW"
Looks like the KC refs were to worried about always protecting the McNuggets. That KC Hail Mary throw was amazing and the catch was so good. Well done the new Champs
The fact that the eagles were playing their 2nd string team in the 4th is all you need to know.
"No, it actually wasnt the MOST defensive dominating SB game in NFL history. You should watch SB50, where the Broncos no fly zone defense just dismantled the Panthers #1 offense 24 - 10. Its not about the score, its HOW they got there."
Ups no Cinderella calls 4 the Chiefs this time and absolutely dominant Eagles=No Super Bowl 4 the Chiefs this time.
Now America win back Your democracy M.A. America Again Let Freedom Ring with Liberty and Justice for all. Peace.
The funny part is just how much holding the Chief's O-line got away with and the Eagles still got that many sacks.
I am sorry Chiefs fans but this was so refreshing to watch!!!
REVENGE has never been this MADDEN.
Okole' kicking!
tried to change my password to 'Eagles Defense' but it says that it's too strong
Stop barkley....at all costs.... brown and smith....ok
This game could have been 60 to 17.....
"Such a fantastic match, deserved a much better halftime show"
Should a been the bills
Eagles defence was absolutely brilliant today coming up with picks and big plays Mahomes was owned by that defence.
When your playing with your younger brother but he always cry about losing
Hey look! Its the Kansas City Chokes!
F your 3peat hahahaha
Man it is weird that they struggle when the refs call a fair game I wonder why hmmmm
Doesn't matter now but that Chiefs first T.D. was because of a missed holding call.....
The Eagles defense keeping the Taylor Swift screentime at a minimum was their best stat.
Chiefs got HURT today
"The Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes' weakness has been brought to light once again. We all saw this years ago when the Bucs demolished them in the Superbowl. You NEED an elite pass rush in order to contain Mahomes. The way he was getting sacked out there, he must have been getting flashbacks of SB LV lol."
Thank you Philly!
The sack in the 4th for the fumble when he gets splatted in the face by one guy while the other slaps his throwing arm back was very satisfying. Definitely the D-line gets the popular vote for MVP. Nice one
"Hopefully, the era of the NFL ruining games because some guy on the Chiefs is banging Tay Tay is over."
Any time an AFC West team loses the Super Bowl it's by a blowout! Super Bowl I: Packers beat Chiefs 35-10 Super Bowl II: Packers beat Raiders 33-14 Super Bowl XII: Dallas beats Denver 27-10 Super Bowl XXI: Giants beat Denver 39-20 Super Bowl XXII: Washington beats Denver 42-10 Super Bowl XXIV: San Francisco beats Denver 55-10 Super Bowl XXIX: San Francisco beats San Diego 49-26 Super Bowl XXXVII: Tampa Bay beats Oakland 48-21 Super Bowl XLVIII: Seattle beats Denver 43-8 Super Bowl LV: Tampa Bay beats Kansas City 31-9 Super Bowl LIX: Philadelphia beats Kansas City 40-22
Karma the chiefs karma from a bills fan
Nick Wright? You here?
Seeing mahomes cry at the end of the game was the best part. Eagles destroyed the chiefs this wasnt even close. Chiefs fans go home and cry yourselves to sleep.
Taking the blueprint the bucs developed and making it even better! Relentless pressure up front and Mahomes stops to look so special when he is constantly on the move. Easier said than done great job on D by the eagles.
Defense still wins championships and tonight further proved that!
Nice when the best team wins and the refs are not the headline
FINALLY FINALLY A HOLDING CALL AFTER 4 SUPERBOWLS AGAINST THE CHIEFS!! THAT FORCED A 4TH DOWN ATTEMPT THAT STOPPED THEM ONCE AGAIN. FINALLY GOOD OFFICIATING THIS TIME. GRATZ TO THE EAGLES
.
Checks didn't clear
"This season has hurt Mahomes GOAT status contention IMMENSELY. If Lamar can get a couple SBs in the next 4-5 years he could go down as the better player between the two. That's a horrid game as you can see and it came in the bigger spot, yes the O-lline was bad but man did he look lost"
Crazy thing is yall being ignorant asf in 5 minutes they cut the lead down half. Imagine if they started the game playing like that. Nobody in these comments would be showing thier balls and saying dumb shii
Thank God The Eagles won!!!
Inject this game directly into my veins!
The eagles won I was voting the chives
Hurtz Donut
Chiefs are done. Period!
"6:11 Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean intercepts Mahomes for a pick-six. What a way to celebrate his 22nd birthday (Born: Feb.9, 2003)."
"The only stat you need to know for this game is that Mahomes got sacked six times against only four men rushes all night. That's complete and utter dominance at the line of scrimmage. Jalen got the MVP, and he deserved it, but that defense took the soul of that KC team."
Good
The eagles defense is amazing
Crazy how stagnant the chiefs were without all those free 1st downs
Hurts = H-town representer!
I know Hurts got the MVP but it should have been the Eagles defense. They were unstoppable all day. To virtually shut out the Chiefs in the Super Bowl is insanely impressive
"Hey I put 100 on the chiefs so Id win no matter what the outcome was , easy"
Eagles defense exposed the Chiefs on the biggest stage.
Mahomes genuinely turned into mac jones
"So cathartic. As a neutral. I didn't see this coming, I knew Philly was a better team but was positive the refs were gonna micromanage run this thing to the minute detail. Happy to be wrong for once, the scriptwriters took a week off! A beat down is so satisfying."
Wow for once Mahomes looks like Caleb Williams thats what happens when you cant protect your quarterback!! Congrats to the Eagles!!
Crazy what happens when Taylor is forced to sit with the normal folk
"Mahomes was probably fuming that the refs weren't calling RtP against Philly every time he got dropped. Also, 12:18 - Jawaan Taylor finally gets flagged for what he's been getting away with throughout the playoffs."
So happy for Hurts. His character has been extraordinary since I started following him. Truly a champion!
Black magic is finished bithceeees
bruh #35 got COOKED
Super Bowl Champs Babyyy
BEST SUPER BOWL EVER!!!! THE EAGLES WASTED NO TIME AT ALL THIS GAME!! BEST WIN EVER!!! This is the best revenge ever after that loss 2 years ago! LOVE THIS TEAM SO MUCH!!!! NO THREEPEAT FOR YOU CHIEFS!!! FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!!!
That Eagles defense was so fun to watch. Punishing Mahomes and moving with purpose. Perfect execution with their gameplan. Well deserved! Fly Eagles FLY!!
Legend has it drake was last seen in Walmart buying rope
Mahomes did not pull a Brady and have a all time Super Bowl come back. Just sayin he had his chance
"The refs called a fair game, maybe even leaned a little towards PHI and KC gets absolutely dominated interesting, very interesting"
Man the Eagles dominated this game early! the Chiefs o-line was soft the defense was slicing through them with ease good job by the Eagles!
"Finally, their streak has ended yayyy"
I don't know the Philadelphia Eagles chant but THANK YOOOOOUUU!!! What a way to end the 2024 NFL season for me!!! I was so sick of hearing how good the Chiefs are and got sick of hearing fireworks every time they won. They even blasted fireworks last night...for nothing!!! Now I get to go to my job and rub it in!!! I'm so happy that none of the refs made it easy for the Chiefs and was most definitely happy seeing Mahomes get lit and fumbled that football!! They were so confident that they were like 'we're not going to throw a parade because of what happened last year....' Like they were going to win the Superbowl. Thank you Eagles!!!!!
Looks like KC will be focusing on shoring up OL in the off season.
I LOVE IT.
I was a eagles fan Im just not interested in watching sports I dont get a trophy or a ring or one million dollars its stupid yall are still broke and gotta wake up for work tomorrow youre team winning the super bowl means nothing drop the beer chips and unhealthy super bowl foods and go to the gym lol
Bout time the chiefs got put in their place. Came into the game with way too much confidence. Eagles came in looking for payback
When the Chiefs were down by 20+ I said to a friend that the game was definitely over. He asked for an explanation as to why and I replied because Mahomes isnt Brady With that reply I just realised that Brady is definitely the greatest QB ever in the NFL.
"Question from Australia, seems a lot of the players were slipping at crucial times of the game, is it artificial turf they are playing on?"
"This game was a perfect example of ""defense wins championships"". Vic Fangio deserves so much credit, taking this defensive unit from one of the worst in the league to the absolute best in the league. Huge props to Howie Roseman, as well, finding diamonds in the rough in free agency and the draft, massively upgrading the roster. I love this team so much. Go, Birds! Sweet revenge!"
Well Mick vick the your old team won thumbs up hats off!!!!!
Congrats Eagles!
No real shock that the Eagles won but I wasnt expecting such a one sided game.
"YEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!! From a Charger to the Eags, THANK YOU!!!!! Fly Eagles Fly"
Another Black History Bowl in the Books! Williams Wilson Mahomes Hurts
"5:26 I'N SORRY, HOW WAS THE PENALTY ON THE SNAPPER??? THREE CHIEFS JUMPED THE LINE AND THEY PENALIZED THE EAGLES?????"
Eagles are superbowl champs
Wasn't even close. Eagles dominated that game. Eagles D came to play.
"Gutted we lost but the Eagles defence was a thing of beauty, fully deserved win for the Eagles."
Chiefs are Fraudelirooskis
"The call on Brown was BS. The Chiefs deserved to lose to this team. The Eagles have the 2K back. I grew up during the 70's when football was more running than passing. The Chiefs got the calls for the past 4-5 years. No way were they the better team than Eagles with Barkley, and they don't have an explosive WR to replace Tyreek Hill."
Only the 5th time this century weve had a dud superbowl
"Mahomes played the worst game of his career and that can be accredited to the Eagles defense and coaching. He has been getting away with mediocre play in Super Bowls his entire career but today it came back to bite him. Hopefully next year he comes in with a dominating mindset because he coasted through the season. We need that 50 TD, 5,000 Mahomes for next year. Chiefs will have a running game next year for sure. I would love to see a rematch of these two teams next year. Its 1-1 now."
Is it me or can you hear the Joy in Brady's voice
Congrats to Eagles fan and everyone who is not Chiefs fan ( Patriots fan here ) and best thing that Tom Brady was commentating.
6:58 Mahomes got sacked by his own teammate LMAO
49ers fan here Happy to see KC go down!
I'm from South Africa and don't know much about the game but was so invested in this one - from all the previews I saw and research done...even I knew the Eagles would walk this one.
Mahomes is still the best QB in the league 3 SBs
"The Eagles dominated on the defensive front four. Jalen Hurts had such a great game, that can never be underestimated ever again. Thanks to the whole Eagles team for making this such a great experience and incredible performance. Love you guys, and thank you for an unforgettable game, from a long time and forever Eagles fan!"
Congrats Eagles from a Seattle fan!
"Tom Brady is still the best, sorry mahomes."
"Dont like the eagles, but glad chiefs didnt make it!"
Philadelphia has been through a lot this year already its nice they have something good to celebrate!
I heard they later found the KC refs tied and gagged in a closet.
But we can all agree that offensive pass interference was actually BS
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!!!
Mohomes is 0-3 against tom brady in the Superbowl when he is in the building
13:29 First Tide player with a touchdown ever in a Super Bowl
Why did i missed this man
"7:28 imagine being down by 17, getting one of the biggest bestings in superbowl history and celebrating a block as if you just won that thing"
That was exiting
I think Eagles last two opponets put allmost 100 points last Team that made so dominant performance in playoffs was 1985 Bears.
Ohio State beating both of these teams. Nobody stopping Jeremiah Smith and Will Howard.
From a Bears fan. Thank you Philly
The chiefs wagon finally runs out of gas. Such a dominant display by the Eagles
Eagles crushing defense! Chiefs only had 1 first down in the entire first half! Hurts shuts up the doubters! 3 peat destroyed!!
They said it couldn't be done.
What is the record for starting a game with unanswered points to start a SB game ?
"DeVontay???? Wtf sort of name is that? Nonetheless, pleased that Philly got it."
How is this a game called football? I have never seen a kick. Corrupt America has created a new version of handball and named it Football/Super Bowl. And the original football has been named Soccer. Stupid and stupid America. Football >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.==6 BILLIONS FANS
And Mahomes still has 3 rings more the the Eagles franchise
Im a basketball fan and i dont fully get this but Hurts is crazy!
Spoiler blocker
"What an amazing performance by the Philadelphia Eagles! This was satisfying to watch as an Eagles fan because of how complete win are as a team. Franchise QB, elite receivers, Mvp-level running back, dominant offensive and defensive lines, elite linebackers, elite secondary. The future is bright for the Eagles."
"What you saw in this Superbowl was a team that was assisted by referees all thru-out the year, to get there. But once the Chiefs got there, those referees were no where to be found... ;)"
"Great day for NFL fans, took the Chiefs and the refs out early!"
Great game Kelce
Thank you eagles for stomping Mahomes and his chiefs in the ground.
"Man, Im so happy for Devonta Smith! That catch was insane, and he lost the High school state championship game in the same exact stadium back in 2016. Now hes back here winning the Super Bowl!!"
"ALL EYES ON REFS,,,, COULDN'T CHEAT OR HELP THE CHIEFS"
Mahomes was out off his play
as a raven fan the chiefs ate bird eagles champs
"chiefs had no business playing like they did out there hats off to the run defense tho, i wanted to see a black man make history tonight appararently powers that be had other plans"
That was a really cool pre season game
"This is probably just me but this year really didnt feel like a SuperBowl besides the halftime show. Idk why, I just didnt feel the hype this year"
"Thankfully, the chieferees were not allowed to make any penalty calls. When it's 11 vs. 11 and not 11 vs. 12, justice is served."
"Bills fan but having the Chiefs in the Super Bowl, allowing the entire country to boo Swift, made the whole thing awesome."
Today it was not Chief's days specially for Patrick Mahomes. So many SACKS (6) and he was always under pressure.. Anyway it is always next time..
"eagles been waiting 2 years for this,and they were not going to be denied..well done Eagles from the UK"
Who cares philly has the crapiest fans in nfl and to think they all wanted coach fored jalf way through year
Eagles came ready Cheifs thought they would auto win
Too big to Rig
Tonight we found out Mahomes is more LeBron than Jordan
this just shows you had bad the chiefs really are with out the refs helping during all those other games..
How is this a game called football? I have never seen a kick. Corrupt America has created a new version of handball and named it Football/Super Bowl. And the original football has been named Soccer. Stupid and stupid America. Football >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>(super bowl or nfl). Billions time better.......6 Billions fan
Brady is Mahomes' kryptonite
somebody help me understand this game
It's about time someone else wins.
RRRRRIIIIIIGGGGGEEEEEDDDDD
Australia has another Superbowl winner
This 40-6 victory is a tale of a real deserving championship team (Eagles) vs a free ticket to the SB team (Chiefs). Poetic justice.
This game was over before kickoff
Chiefs started to find their groove but unfortunately they were a day late and a dollar short.
In nelson from the Simpsons voice ah ha no more Taylor Swift stop showing state farm commercials the refs helped them against many teams when the game was close that's why Iam glad kc Cheats got blown out old saying is true cheaters never win philly out played em on both sides of the ball its over for Drake too Kelce mad at Taylor Swift too get da fuc out my face............. good job Kendrick Lamar you got last laugh Al Michaels was glad too after what the NFL did to him after comments of Taylor Swift
This was a really good baseball game !!!
chiefs aint used to flags going against them.
Waoo. Chiefs got beat down the first 3 quarter shout to the Eagleas
"Was surprised to hear the Cheats lose, happy that they didn't 3 peat"
Not overly impressed with the announcers.
"To all Steelers fan: Kenny Pickett 1, TJ Watt 0."
Man chiefs did not belong in the superbowl. Woulda been much better with ravens or bills but good to see the chiefs lose
Congrats Eagles. Job well done.
Just here for the comments!!!
Now can he afford an engagement ring for Taylor?
17:17 Hopkins made up for that drop there
The Eagles D-Line were the MVPs of this game...but their secondary were absolutely phenomenal as well. Interceptions and pass break-ups diving from out of nowhere. Even Tom Brady said that this game reminded him of when the Giants came out and gave everything on defense to defeat him and the Patriots 2007. One of the most dominating performances in a SB in the last 20 years.
"the past 2 super bowls the chiefs won as the refs protected mahomes as they didnt penalise his defense, for holding and even this season the refs turned a blind eye to the chiefs offensive line cheating. did this time mahomes had no time and made lots of errors .. so the refs actually did what they are suppose to do for every game . not just the big games . pleased the EAGLES Won.. and stupid taylor swift was upset . travis aint getting any tonight.."
18:09 64 air yards is crazy!!
Cant wait to hear nick wright excuse tomorrow
Why yall censor Gaza Sudan ??
Without the 49ers this was boring af
THREE PEAT? NO! DEFEAT!
"Like Will Howard to Jeremiah Smith, 56 yards pass"
The Eagles O and D lines were unreal. Suffocating Mahomes and opening up options for Hurts to run.
Go Birds:)
The eagles are flying high
Clinical performance from Eagles and well deserved! I am predicting Eagles vs Bills next superbowl!
What a birthday for Cooper and Saquan. Congratulations to them!
Seeing Mahomes get sacked 8 times brought me joy
Happy Kansas City Chiefs LOST!!! Happy Eagles WON!!!
"Cant wait for the Chiefs to appear in and win 3 more Super Bowls as part of the scripted ""three-peat redemption"" arc. It'll be a rematch verse the Eagles and Travis Kelce's retirement year. Its almost genius."
18:06 IS THIS THE DAGGER
Looks like Bradys presence was able to nullify the devils magic
"It seems that that pep party aboard #BattleshipNewJersey helped out! PS: in the words of a British YouTuber who covers #WorldOfTanks and #WorldOfWarships... ""This is a paddlin'!"""
"A spoiled team who didnt show up, what a disgrace. This is on Kelsey and Mahomes. Om glad the legacy took a big hit. They got smoked."
So happy to have the Cheats lose
"As a Bills fan,congrats to Philly for a great win. Kellen Moore,just like in college is the real deal. Best of luck to you Kellen in the Big Easy."
Payment must of been late to the refs lol
"""Cosmetic"" points at the end doesn't change the fact the Chiefs got ripped a new butthole..."
"As Eagles fan, I love seeing fans from other franchises rally behind us. Thank you. Its an amazing thing. With that said, we'll see yall next season, were not done. Go Birds!"
KANSAS Got Spanked Cheers To y'all in Philly
3 interceptions ( as I counted) by Mahoms. The Eagle defense was outstanding. They wiped them off the field. The Eagles didn't even play in the final period. Mahoms can't be happy we scored.
Milton Williams gonna get paid
"Was calling an Eagles blowout for the last 2 weeks. Go birds the chiefs are certainly a dominant team but in reality the eagles should have won in 2022 and the niners should have taken at least 1 from the chiefs. Mahomes could easily only have one ring but nonetheless, there's a new dynasty coming. We have the best defense in the league and it showed tonight, and on top of that, they're young"
The Eagles would have had 3 Super Bowl wins if the Refs didnt bailed the chiefs out from Super Bowl LVII. But look how badly they played and how many penalties they received.
Refs started cheating early in this game and the Chiefs still lostGeaux Eagles!!!
Defense won this game. No question Chiefs didn't reach Eagles field til end of 3rd Qtr.
KC was no match to the Eagles's D-Line
To think there was talk about firing Nick Sirianni. Guess the Eagles front office wised up before pulling a Jerry Jones!
Mahomes got absolutely bullied bruv that strip sack and push afterwards was an insane move kudos eagles
"Epic game! Sack, sack, sack sack sack!"
Birds! Cheesesteaks for everyone
The Chiefs can't win an honest game...Go Eagles
The one time i root for the chiefs this happens...i think ima become a chiefs fan
"That's what happens when you boast and brag all year . Remember this , the same thing that can make you laugh can make you cry ."
"The Chiefs lost, and America won."
"Finally, someone planted Mahomes in the dirt, where he needed to be. Grats Eagles, you did America a favor tonight."
"Well done Eagles, coming from a Raider fan."
Eeffff mahommo
WOOOOOOO
"The thing is, the Packers played better in their two games against the Eagles this year. Makes me feel a bit better about losing those games."
I got day-old dishes less washed than Mahomes
"as a patriots fan, the eagles squashing the chiefs alleviates the pain of our SB loss to them"
It seems that that pep party aboard #BattleshipNewJersey helped out!
Mahones trolled my thoughts he getting booted back to college football....GO EAGLES
He stepped out
So happy that the refs didnt dictate this one. Congrats Eagles! Coming from a Stiller
Nuuuuuul a chier Mahomes
Devante is the sleep hero
Refs were never going to let chiefs win.
Those people that were booing mat araiza are horrible people as he was proven innocent and the case dropped against him
The cracks show in KC
Chiefs got pounded raw
Taylor: I knew the Eagles were trouble when they walked in.
"Thank God on a global scale : football , rugby, hockey >>> handegg"
THIS REMINDED ME OF SUPER BOWL 48
Yoo why are these yankees wearing a spacesuit
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA NO THREEPEAT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"Is it me, or does the new scoreboard just bother me"
Perfect strategy: Chiefs got put to sleep by Lauren Diagles southern lullaby version of America the beautiful and Eagles just didnt listen.
Congrats Eagles
Trevor Lawrence had a 27 point comeback but once mohomo goes down by 10 he folds? Huh
Brady still the goat
6 sacks no blitzes btw LMAO best d line in the nfl
Philadelphia Eagle are champions - Stunning performance
Truth is mahomes was scared to throw the bell after those two intersections
"Regardless, the only 'Dallas' who won tonight is Goedert."
Jalen hurts is as cool as a cucumber.
I didnt care who won this game. But I wanted it to at least be a game. What an embarrassment for KC.
"I said may Patty be intercepted and sacked, often"
Robert De Niro felice....
I guess Taylor is gonna have to wait for a while before getting married
What a relief. In truth this has been coming a long time. The Chiefs have sneaked by in a lot of games this season and haven't looked that good. It would have been a travesty had they won the big game.
Hasta la vista Chiefs!!!
So happy Eagles won. so happy
Congratulations Philadelphia Eagles
As an Aussie I can't be happier for Philadelphia and fellow Aussie and No 68 Jordon Mailata.
As a non-American. This is pretty boring for a Final
And the REFS STILL TRIED TO HELP THE CHIEFS!!!!!
Kansas City on Fraud Watch after this game.
sweet ...
man the chiefs were asleep
Bobby Gerald Edwards net Worth is 900 million dollars now and forever... August 21st 1988
Everybody and they momma could see how rigged up this junk was. Thank God for college football.
they did not show taylor swift this year.
I just cant wait to hear Big Jays happiness.
Hahaha
Cheif players was crying on the sideline in the 3rd qt eagles thank you
Go birds! For Johnny and his brother
Jalen just silenced the haters
"Yo, Adrien! We did it!"
Chiefs are so dam unlikeable happy they lost big
Chiefs cannot do anything without referees
"Crazy part is that Philly is more stacked than 2 years ago, there was no way KC would be able to stop the run at all,"
I know tom brady is happy mahomes lost
Chiefs played like a team of ray guns
I never bet on the SB Could be won by either team
Its Always Sunny In
The worst halftime show ever....
Its like watching JV football vs Ohio State.
This was sinfully satisfying for everyone outside of KC Missouri.. Fck the Chiefs
KC SOLD BADLY
Jalen career vs tua career
BORING!!
So glas the Eagles one! Congrats! Absolutely deserved! Sending support from Croatia!
Not a happy night in KC
"Cooper Dejean, you legend."
The most biased play-by-play announcers I ever heard. As long as Mahomes didn't get sacked or intercepted according to them he made a great play.
I did not expect the game to be lobsided like that it was not even close at all the eagles were the better team happy to see them win the super bowl
Now for next season let the afc winner to be anyone but the chiefs
Congratulations Philadelphia Eagles! Philly doing the NFC East proud.
Eagles going back to back
Eagles defense was immaculate! The TD from Coop was the cherry on top!
Refs didn't even get a chance to help today. The Eagles were just too good.
WE ACTUALLY DID IT
"Poor Travis, Taylor can't hold his hand"
I didn't watch it but was happy that the refs couldn't call the out come of the game.
AJ had a tremendous game !
I gotta say it idc no more Jaylen hurts better then Lamar Jackson
":55 I almost threw my tv out the window. I thought the refs were looking to give the Chiefs another Super Bowl, but they gave us a make up call on the next drive. Great game! Go birds"
Watching Mahomes get flattened constantly fills me with so much joy
33 yds and 2 INTs at the half. Mahomes has been looking overrated af lately.
0-34 might as well let Taylor Swift be the QB at that point
7:28 I was so nervous he was going to fumble there
Time for all the swifties to cry
This one is for Johnny Hockey and his brother! Johnny Gaudreau
..
Mahomes could Of beat em easy he let em have it
"Congrats Eagles, PHLLY STAND UP!!! Coach Reid seemed to out-think himself by not running the ball at all the 1st half against the Eagles defense which was stacked to play the pass."
Year of the snake is not good for pig and that's what Patrick (1995) is
Chiefs were so focused on stopping Barkley that they forgot their other plays!! GO EAGLES GO!!! #CHAMPS
FLY EAGLES FLY!!
"DeJean started the beat down, happy birthday buddy!!"
The chiefs offensive guard team was non existent today offering mahomes no protection all game
I guess the check bounced lol
Mohomes dancing and dancing and dancing... Great Eagles!
Targeting by Cheats
Too bad the chiefs are alive.
Give the defense coordinator a raise!!! That defense was on fire!!!
Congratulations Eagles with the shut out!! And man great team great quarterback and what a freaking awesome kicker!! Man this team is so good!! So happy for them and congrats to Eagles as Super Bowl champs!! How can I phrase this!? Oooohhh love Hurts!!
So glad the Kansas City cheaters got denied the win
Thank you Eagles for exposing the Refs and Chiefs to the world
We really got to see Eagles won 2 Lombardi Trophy before GTA 6!
"Taylor Swift is gonna dump T. Kelce, and she's gonna come up with a new record. It is gonna be called. I used to have a tight end."
So much for those expert picks.
"As a jaguars fan, fly eagles fly and the chiefs and all their fans"
Give the MVP to Howie Roseman.
"Like we all knew, Chiefs were never that good. Cant win without the refs."
Most one sided SB in my lifetime. Well done Eagles
"Mahomes was looking at the refs, like come on guys I need some help here."
Glad no 3peat
"Eagles are dynasty destroyers. First Brady and the Pats, now Mahomes n the Cheifs. LOVE IT!!! So happy to be an Eagles fan"
"Man, this is painful to watch. I was hoping for 3 peat."
4:30 I was so nervous after that
Youre not even a minute into the third quarter and youve had more sacks than youve had first downs. You can tell what team did their homework
"No referee bailouts on either side of the ball, no excuses, just absolute dominance. Go Birds"
I was telling folks at work the eagles were going to win via blowout and they all thought i was tripping. I should've bet
"Karma , the chiefs shouldn't be in the SB and yes the Buffalo Bills."
"Don't feel sorry for the Cheats, not one bit"
nice talents
"This is the outcome when you artificially boost a team into the super bowl, aka, giving the games away through refs. The chiefs were the worst team period entering into the playoffs - this game solidifies just that. Bills would have had a much better chance. Go bears."
Twice Mahomes has been completely embarrassed in the bowl. He will never surpass Brady
3:20 the brotherly shove
La & Philly have a scared bond . Kobe from Philly and we love him . Kendrick performed on your Super Bowl victory. And were the last two cities who throw hands . Squabble up
Not the goat getting blown out TWICE ina Super Bowl
gross
Do you guys think Taylor Swift is working hard this week to make her man happy after such devastating defeat? hahahaha
Chiefs didnt deserve to be there. Talk about one of the worst Super Bowl showings in the history of the Super Bowl.
Awesome dominance Eagles BUT next year can we get a Bills v Lions final. Now that would be sweet
Chiefs Refs didn't show up to the game.
Where is the movement from the Eagles snapper on this penalty at 5:17?
Im surprised they let Mahomes get hit.
"The Eagles defense was amazing, congratulations"
2:00 pats running for his life
"Yall full of shhh crying over the refs the whole season. I bet, I guarantee you the eagles will NOT be in the superbowl the next 2 seasons in a row Or in the NFC championship game 7 seasons in a row. Enjoy this win for the next 6 months or so."
Finally Taylor Swift is not more important than NFL
This just proves that defense indeed does win championships
WAY TO GO EAGLES!!!
Eagles put on an absolute clinic on all fronts.
41 minutes and 38 seconds before the Chiefs even got into philly territory. 44 minutes and 26 seconds before they put ANY points on the board... that was a defensive clinic put on by the Eagles tonight
Philly makes the best tasting chiefsteaks.
As a British person who has no clue whats happening wheres LeBron James
This game was rigged for big bookies. Mahomes was literally wearing green when he entered the stadium
7:20 is this guy even watching the game? It's 0-17 LMAO
I know the oline didnt play well for KC. Patrick Mahomes is not great in pre snap reads
Without the refs the Chiefs aint shiiiii
The most boring sport on Earth!!!!
Mahomes was so completely outclassed in this game it was a joke. Jalen Hurts is an NFL superstar in the making.
All part of the script. Pro sports at the highest levels are all WWE hand picked champions
Eagles were just merciless. Made the Chiefs look like a bunch of kids playing a game they didn't know anything about.
Eagles took the refs outta the game and just stomped on the Chiefs
15:43 I CANT STOP WATCHING ITS SO SATISFYING! HAHAHAHA
The Chiefs QB started to look at the d-line too much. Haha! Tony Romeo calls him the Michael Jordan of the NFL. MJ took harder hits wearing a tank top and shorts. This was the most satisfying win Ive ever witnessed. What a victory. World Champions.
Just imagine if Kansas had won. We would have had to suffer more of swift in our faces. Maybe there is a god.
Who says defense doesnt win championships Also it seems like Jake Elliot is probably the most reliable kicker in the league currently
6:16 my favorite play of the game. I jumped outta my chair with excitement. First sign that the Chiefs were going to lose
Next year we go again bills mafia
"I knew this was coming because the chiefs simply aren't talented enough. They are well coached but offensively they just have that kelce run a back yard route tree in the mid field. And that's it really. They don't have elite threats outside. Dhop isnt that guy anymore. Juju either. Worthy isnt.... well, worthy. The rbs are ok. The defense is sound with a brilliant coordinator. But outside of chris jones and mcduffie, noone is exactly elite either. Very good. The online is mid. But the eagles are stacked with blue chippers everywhere."
ASK NOT THE SPARROW HOW THE EAGLE SOARS
"So this is what it looks like when the refs make basically their jobs. Man, this feels for the first time in years like a real football game, and everyone enjoyed it. BTW this is the reality not only for the chiefs this is the reality for every team that get help from the nfl or the refs (that's basically the same thing). Thank you eagles"
"Glad the Eagles won, they were brilliant on the night."
What a thorough beat down.
"This was rigged for the big bookies, Mahomes was literally wearing green when he entered the stadium"
1 of the worst superbowls ever
"The Eagles made it too Big to RIG for the Chiefs and their referees folks, greatness begins on the defensive side and the Eagles defensive coordinator won this game folks!!"
gnarly
crying of joy
Go birds
"This was the worst super bowl I ever watched, well at least jaylen hurts finally have a ring"
"The worst performance of mahomes and the eagles' offense and defense was so good, like how many times they intercepted mahomes throws. No more tom brady comparison brady is the goat"
How much they pay mahomes to throw the bake away
The pettiness of Eagles fans doing the tomahawk chop while blowing the Chiefs out in 4th quarter had me cracking up
glad to see them play like the COWBOYS..... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ALL EYES ON THE REF'S THIS TIME SO THATS WHAT YOU GET
Baun shoulda got DPOY
Y'all Chief fan ok? lol
Scorebug design is horrible.
And Heeereeee weeee goooooo
As a Chicago Bears fan thanks philly eagles for making the superbowl fun again finally eagles ended the cheifs winning streak W Game
Refs were still kind of favoring the Chiefs. Mahomes didn't know how to react. Every AFC team who aren't KC should be loving this.
A forward shuffle pass beyond the line of scrimmage is allowed? Mahomes at 14:25?
Thank you Philly!!!
Pp
Pp
Great game I'm really glad that everybody was humble at the end great sportsmanship
Kenny gets a ring
Ppp
"NFL Has to Stop Fixing These Seasons in The AFC lol, too many Entertaining QBs."
All season long all I heard was nothing but negative about hurts..but I knew he was that dude for the past 3 yearsgreat job eagles
O
"From a Chicago Bears fan, THANK YOU PHILLY."
Worst Super Bowl in Super Bowl history Bart Starr rolling over in his grave
Hopkins thought he was bout to get a ring
"I don't care what any salty chiefs fans say, the chief got EXPOSED tonight! We all knew they were frauds but we didn't know it was THIS bad!!! Honestly pathetic. Not even an eagles fan but this was oh so glorious!!! The refs didn't get a big enough check pre game"
"The Eagles are the only team to have beaten both Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. They also stopped two three-peat attempts (although the first of the two was inadvertent, as they beat the Patriots in the middle of their three consecutive Super Bowl appearances)."
This is the reason why the mavs gm thinks defence wins championships
Eagles just completly dominated the Chiefs here LMAO wasn't even close Chiefs were the worst 15 win team ever in NFL history so glad the Chiefs didn't get to 3 peat they don't desreve it at all and well guess the refs weren't helping the Chiefs after lol still good for you Eagles you earned it and hopefully we won't have to see Swift again in the NFL either.
"Im a Dolphin's Fan but no Lie, thank God the Eagles Won."
For one night only.... I was an Eagles fan
Imagine only getting on a Eagles territory on third qrt. that's a heck of a defense
after years of losing in the Super Bowl it feels so good to finally win one
Congratulations to the Philly Eagles!! They dominated the game!!
That L couldn't have gone to a more deserving team.
Post to be the Lions & Reavens
Can we just play those 6 sacks in a continuous loop please
Yeah Eagles nation on top again
Brady wags terrible and annoying call this game.
The best player in Kansas City book is the flop and the extra head bobs of somebody goes near your helmet to make it look like they grabbed your face mask. None of those tricks work tonight. Not even their most famous play the Hail Mary pass interference call
KC sold out to stop Barkley but couldnt stop the Eagles other weapons at the same time. That Eagles defense was insane all night too! 3peats are just so hard to complete. Niners Cowboys and KC could almost taste it.
Is Spags out the Door ? Where is his postgame @chiefs ??? We want to know why he gave this game away? He was terrible
Brady in SB again?
"Hmmm, the refs not playing for the chiefs tonight, this is the true team the chiefs have been all year, they just did not have their stripped buddies at their back to make them look good."
"Anyone else think the in-game overlay for the scoreboard was kind of whack? Font style did NOT match that of the Superbowl and almost reminded me of what Nickelodeon would use. An almost cartoonish, fortnight like font and layout. First thing that caught my eye and I had to do a double take that I wasn't on some kind of Nickelodeon version of the game like they did last year."
Tom Brady thanks for exposing these fraud Chiefs
Only Tom Brady could have turned this game
Cheaters never win congrats eagles
BigW for Eagles. Hurts #1 Ring the man!
Cooper Dejean is cold
Cant wait to hear Skip decimate this pitiful performance to Sharp's beloved Mahomo...
The Eagles Defense show'd out in this game.
"sack boi, sacked multiple times lol"
"As a 49ers fan, i tip my hat to the Eagles. Your team showed up and balled out! Dominated on both sides, but that defense was something special. Way to rep the NFC! And way to prevent that 3 peat , enjoy this win, see you next season"
"The SB MVPs should be all of the Eagles lineman. Congrats Eagles, most impressive win!"
15:44 was the highlight of the night.
NFL Starting to flop like basketball smh lol gggeessshhhh
Brady has done it again. GOAT.
Justice has been served! Referees didn't help Mahomes and the rest of his mediocre cheaters chiefs players this time. About those Chiefs now KC fans?!
The highlights video on the Chiefs Youtube page is gonna be really short huh
At 7:20 . Did dude really just say that???? The Eagles hasnt been able to do much because of the Kansas City Chiefs defense????? Are we watching the same games bruh?????
"If the chiefs being beaten this badly in the super bowl is the NFL's way of telling us that they never rigged anything, its cute, and i'm happy they lost. But i will never believe them."
Game was over in the 2nd quarter boring game
Soooo great to see the KC Cheats get absolutely BITCHSLAPPED Wasnt even close!! THANK YOU EAGLES
Mahomes will be back
Amazing to see Mahones get manhandled like a rag doll.
FLY EAGLES FLY!
"Chiefs before the game: THIS IS PATRICK! Chiefs after the game: Ow, that Hurts!"
"So, if there was not the bad weather, rams could win them all huh"
Really yall thought Chiefs was a basketball team 3 peat LoL Eagles Superbowl Champs
Lets be honest which blowout was worst Commanders or Chiefs?
"This is what happens when lead players are showing off partying before the game takes place. Kelce and Mahomes out partying the night before the game!!! They just thought they would win by showing up. The eagles wanted it more, the chiefs thought they already won it with flashy blonde wags"
I am not a fan of either time....I like to Eagles less. I am happy for the folk from Philly. It is nice for them that they have a super bowl championship. Philly is a looser in every other way.
Lets be honest which blowout was worse Commanders or Chiefs?
"Its absolutely LAUGHABLE to pretend Mahomes is the goat. He offered nothing in this game, nothing."
"The reason the score is so lopsided, is because the ref's carried the Chiefs all season and they weren't good enough to be there."
We could hear Mahomes choking from the uk
Ill remember this for the rest of my life
"Hand in his facemask, and announcer says he shouldn't have called interference. True should have been FACEMASK."
Well eagles won ! But for how long if musk has a say so in this ? He probably end up striping them of trophy!
I dont wanna ever hear another Mahomes comparison to Brady. Never again.
The last week leading up to this. I was hearing everyone with a mic online talking about KC have a guaranteed threepeate..... Well.... To all of you who were so confident in your assessment...... Nope.
Chiefs reign is over!
93
Chiefs confirmed frauds. You can only buy out the refs so much.
40-6 is brutal cant even count the final 2 scores against their backups. Congratulations Eagles
So glad all the noise about the refs made them call a clean game. Look at the result Any other playoff team would have been better than the Chiefs - Refs.
The owner of the Chiefs is under investigation for bribing refs
The Giants GM is so incredibly fired
you dont bet against patrick mahomes they said
4th quarter Mahomo remembered he is a good QB. But unfortunately there was no 5th quarter
6:01 Travis can't block
Kenny Pickett winning a ring before our Steelers f this dude
"Maybe Im tripping, but the Chiefs defense seemed to be lacking or just...deflated. Around the 2nd or 3rd touchdown it was like bro...RUN. They were just letting The Eagles fly by (pun intended). I was rooting for The Eagles anyway but Kansas defense got me irritated at some point."
Stop with the whole nfl is rigged at and the refs want chiefs to win nonsense. This game showed you to stop being ignorant and delusional . The chiefs are THAT good. Just didnt show up tonight. Eagles are the better team
This is one of the greatest day of my life. I cry 2004 eagles lost superbowl after 20 years later jalen hurt wipe my tears. I love every minute of it. Jalen hurt is offspring of Donovan mcnabb.
Chiefs got cooked
For those about the rock We salute You
"""I've been able to use every experience and learn from it, the good and the bad, using it as fuel. "" Jalen Hurts. Need I say more than what the MVP has said?"
Is this like when the mavs clapping the suns cheeks but its on the NBA finals?
since when this game has become so soft?
The fact that mahomes threw a touchdown at the end of the game shows what kinda dirtbag he is
Orange stain curse strikes again.
Crazy that the two Cheifs losses in the SB have been blowouts
Sure he calls hurts Barkley
Most boring Super Bowl ever?
That toss from Smith to the ref at about 13:10 is smooth af
Aaron Rodgers coached a helluva game.
Now they can all go to Hollywood be real actors
Packers fan here. I'm so glad The Chiefs didn't win again. Congrats to the Eagles! Congrats to Jalen Hurt!
Not a fan or either team but that was about as one sided as it gets
Deandre Hopkins is WASHED.
Wow! The Eagles really came to win for sure! Nobody dominates the Chiefs in that manner!
Thank god we dont have to see taylor swift celebrating
So satisfying to see the Kansas Swifty Refs get embarrassed in the biggest game of the year!
that toss to the ref at 13:13 was on point!!
I absolutely LOVED watching Mahomes get obliterated all night. So satisfying!!!
XAI315K #1 Crypto Out rn...
"i love my chiefs, but our offense sucked ballz"
"Eagles was flying today, congrats"
As a Rams fan Im glad this was worse than the 3-12 SB game with the pats
Tampa 2 defense
Kudos for mahomes for his fear of not wanting burrow to get into the playoffs
"It's 1:45 a.m. EST & Philly ""fans"" still mobbing, setting fires according to Philly police/fire scanner........shame on you! Eagles showed great teamwork, class & dedication & the fools hit the streets, damage stores & cars to ""celebrate""."
If XAI315K isn't on your investment portfolio yet you're not paying attention
As a NFL Fan f MAHOMES
Omg
When did Chris Griffin start doing color commentary
"Them chefs looked like they were more winded than Andy Reid at after taking 10 stair steps, lol"
It is what it is
Cinema.
"Even though i am a Chiefs fan i just have these few words: ""How about those Eagles!"" Super Bowl Champs!!!"
seewhathappens when the refs dont make all the bad calls mahomes is not the almighty whit good refs
Congratulions
Chiefs shouldve never been there to begin with ravens or bills shouldve been there
Surely now everyone can stop crying about the refs supposedly helping KC.
It's very frustrating to see the amount of fouls that were called on the Eagles when they were field goals. They were very picky when the fouls were on the Chiefs.
Finally no more swifts craps
hurts dont it!!
It looked like Mahomes was purposely throwing to the other team. Oh well
Nick Wright
Beat the breaks off them Chiefs! GOOOOOOO BIIIIIIIIRDSSSSSS
Bye bye chiefs kingdom jajajajajajaja .
Super Bull Cycle for XAI315K. This coin won't stop profitting.
I laughed so hard at 7:00 Mahomes betrayed by the refs and his own teammates
Mahomes under Montana
"Funny how the refs stoped helping the cheaters,"
Kelce was ineffective and Invisalign tonight. Go sell insurance with the swifties.
Revenge is a dish best served cold
I believe XAI315K will defeat bit coin
KC offence lineman are such cheaters. Watch the play at 1 25 3rd quarter . steps over guy so he can't get up.
Don't talk about mahomes being the goat for another 5 years n8gas
Greetings From Philadelphia! Home of The 2025 Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles!Celebrate with us ! We are The New America's team.
"I imagine the chiefs offensive game plan went something like ""dont let Jalen Carter beat us."" I guess that technically worked but those double teams opened it up for the rest of the line and they stepped tf up. That was a defensive masterclass"
Htown mane!!!shout out to one of htown coldest j hurts
Kobe and Shaq 3peat within all 4 major professional sports teams still intact after 23 years
Them boys dont look so good without the zebras
Beautiful! No three cheat for the chiefs!
Eagles:40 KC Refs:22 U love to see it
Mahomes definetley thought he was about to have his tom brady 28-3 comeback momment
"Grande difesa delle aquile, ha vinto la partita. Le aquile volano alto, dall' Italia un saluto e grazie dello spettacolo."
"Pittsburgh fan here, thank you Philadelphia. The refs couldnt help Kansas City this game. Buffalo got robbed in the AFC championship and Philadelphia got robbed a few years ago when Kansas City were beneficiaries of questionable officiating in the Super Bowl"
"I was starting to think Mahomes was the goat like Nick Wright said, so i turned on this game expecting easy 3 peat and watched him play worse than nfl backups. I'm back to believing Tom Brady always was and always will be the GOAT"
My fellow 49er fans tonight was a great night
"THE NFL IS SOO VERY CORRUPT, ODDS ARE IN VEGAS THAT IS WOKES IS A JOKE"
Might be a bit too early to talk about exit strategies but XAI315K will be a TOP 3 Crypto this year..
Da bears! Good thing they didn't draft mahomes over trubisky! The guy looked awful
Joe Montana > Mahomes
Taylor Swift can't sway an election or a Super Bowl.
Eagles stepped up in the most important moments..DLine monstered KC OLine.
That mustve been the 1st holding penalty of the chiefs OL during the Super Bowl run theyve had smh
I tripled my portfolio with XAI315K investment alone...
i dont know about nothing about nfl someone explain me how this kc team reaches to the finals
Make all the excuses you want. You can hate all you want and move all the goal-posts you want. My Home-Town Birdz are YOUR SB Champions!!
GO BIRDS!!!
And people thought Mahomes was the goat
The defense won the match! It was amazing to watch!
The outcome was exactly what I predicted if the Eagles D line dominated the line of scrimmage and the defense showed up.Defense Wins Championships.
Enjoy your moment for now Eagles fans
"I'm not a huge fan of either team, but seeing the number of times Mahomes was planted on the turf brought a smile to my face. My congratulations to the Eagles players, coaches, and fans for a dominant performance"
nobody gives a F beside some americans
Holding on BG first chiefs td 14:26
Hurts got some catching up to do with rings
But honestly how in the world Camera man found Kevin Hart in this crowd?
DON'T YOU EVER DISRESPECT HURTS AGAIN
"Been a 49ers fan since 2019, after experiencing the 2 years of pain (24, 20) I thought this would've lasted forever after the blowout in 21. (By Tom of course) Thank you Eagles for doing something my 49ers couldn't do. ""Sack + Interceptions"" all game"
What everyone wanted to see Mahomes going to sleep 15:46
They should have subbed mahomes besides its good having a fair Super Bowl for once
"Eagles win, haters are satisfied, everything is OK :) But Eagles win was absolutely deserved, Chiefs played like in bushleague."
The Bills would have given us a better game!
Wooo Birds babyyyyy
Eagles win 2 in a row then we can all talk
Great Video! BTW amazing call on investing in XAI315K. I'm up 200% already and it's just the beginning.
Where was Taylor Swift?
Keystone Champs
Browns fan here: How does one get to the Super Bowl? Congrats Philly. That was definitive.
Only 40 points...
Awesome
Is it just me or the NFL script was ditched for this one?
And this is the man you dare to compare to Tom?? Wtf. Hahaha
"NFL helped the Chiefs get to the Superbowl and pretty much said ""Sorry its up to yall now. The world catching on to us now."""
We cowboys fans are all losers in this Superbowl
Be honest although we was happy the cheifs lost it was still probably the most boring Super Bowl of all time considering that it wasnt even close.
Not a fan of either team but I know Jalen feels good. Redemption
.
"This is exactly what the chiefs needed, the whole season they didnt play good at all and it showed in the Super Bowl. Everyone thats saying theyre happy for the Chiefs to lose will be short lived trust me. Mahomes will have a mvp season and will be back at the Super Bowl."
Who else saw that throw to the ref after the D Smith TD
There was literally people in the crowd wearing thier favorite teams jersey other than the Eagles rooting for the EaglesI love that
Great video! Do you still consider XAI315K the best crypto investment for this year? We all want to know!
Notice how the refs were actually decent and the score was lopsided(not for the chiefs) The GOAT who???
6:55
"That eagle's defense won the SB, my god.. what a game they had."
"I don't give a **** what you guys say, Poor Taylor Swift"
THANK YOU PHILADELPHIA EAGLES!!!!THAAANNNKKKK YOUUUUUU!!!! WORDS CANT NOT DESCRIBED MY HAPPINESS !!!!
"As the saying goes, Defenses wins championships. Eagles Defense showed up and showed out. They deserve the win with that stellar performance and onslaught they ensued on Mahomes.. kid had no time to get anything down the field."
so glad the chiefs lost
Everyone will hate the Eagles next season
Yo that was crazy
Mahomes was stat padding
Fell asleep 2nd quarter Boring game this year.
This is what happens when the kid that cheats/steals someone elses homework has to take the biggest test of the year and they are clueless See what happens when you dont have the NFLs help? The Chiefs shouldnt have been anywhere near the Super Bowl this year
MAHOMES LOST LIKE A DOG
Cheif get the to many commercials curse look at the past.
How about Cooper Dejean! What a moment for the rookie - he needed to explode to make the TD and he delivered. As an aussie these are the type of plays that first got me hooked on NFL three years ago.
GOOD RIDDENS KC!!
The most satisfying victory Ive witnessed.
Investing in XAI315K is similar to marrying a wonderful wife. Picking the new flasy meme coin of the week is like choosing a mistress. It usually does not end well.
WELL DONE FELLAS
show us taylor nfl
Mahomo never be a goat. Brady on top. Worse qb performance i ever seen plus team effort in super bowl
Jalen hurts played clutch in crucial moments.. unbelievable job .. the TD to smith. 220 yards passing and 72 yards rushing.. he was dual threat
Anybody that is still confused as to how UGA went back to back in 22-23 just needs to watch the eagles defense and then Google Brock Bowers and Ladd McConkey rookie stats. It'll clear that all up for ya. (It will also explain why we've been significantly less dominant these last two years).
"I didn't get to watch the game this year, but watching the highlights and not having to hear Travis Kelce every five seconds was priceless"
This game finally puts an end to the debate of who's the GOAT Mahomes or Brady
As a chiefs fan: congratulations eagles!
Mahomes played terrible. The whole team looked unprepared. Very strange.
In 10 ys they all will have dementia from these blows.
Well played esgles
I prefer football than this
Everyone is just glad the Chiefs lost.
Worst halftime show in Super Bowl history
Bad day in the office for KC. Those turnovers made the difference.
I think they out to have a collective award.. most valuable unit... No question that it was the Eagles Defence tonight Vic Fangio picked the perfect time to break his 0-7 record against Mahomes/ Chiefs... Wow
This loss just open the doors for a tyreek chiefs reunion
Only alt coins have collapsed. Bitcoin is dipping but XAI315K coin is going parabolic
Brady >>>>>>>> Kermit
Mahomes still catching up to Brady???
"This beat down was so satisfying, watching you cocky, arrogant nfl favorite douchbags get humbled was awesome"
BELT 2 AHHHHHHHZ
man that score bug was ahhhhh
"enjoy it eagles fans, only one yall getting in the 2020s."
Order has been restored
As a chiefs fan: congratulations eagles!
Both KC's players and fans were in dire need of a nice thick slice of humble pie. I'm glad Philly served it up.
"I honestly thought this would have been a hard fought game for the Eagles. I did not expect such a sweeping victory. But I'm satisfied to have had my expectations blown. Congratulations, Eagles! Fly Eagles Fly!"
"Is it just me, or did Kelce look down and out WAY too early in this game? Like, he knew they were going to lose the from the start of the game. In fact, he's kinda looked that way throughout the whole season. Sad and pouty, instead of jovial and energetic like he used to be. Tonight, he and Mahomes looked pathetic. Kinda fishy."
Blueprint on how to beat the Chiefs: beat em so bad the Refs cant help them
"Congratulations to the Eagles for beating the Chiefs and the refs in Superbowl 59, which my team didn't do last year."
Plz bring back Vic Fangio. I pray Shane Steichen comes back too .
Kobe this is for you
Brady would've made a comeback and won. That's the difference between the GOAT and Mahomie
Adam gibi oynayn ulan. Kimse kansastan byk deildir. Buras kansas
"The line the line the line, that's were all the differences were made. Mahomes didn't have his protection, they got plowed through. And eagles had protection"
They should really change the playoff format so that its just top 7 or 8 out of the whole 32 teams that go through to the playoffs rather than splitting the 2 conferences. You got all the juggernaut Qbs in the AFC having knock each other other when they all deserve a ring. And then you got a NFC which im ngl is easy to make it to superbowl giving the QBs you have there.
"Chiefs, ""Come on refs what are you guys doing"". Refs, ""Not tonight guys the entire world is watching""."
Good news after Good news - Elon Musk set to launch his new crypto token XAI315K. I'm all-in baby
"Brady, Eli > Mahomes"
They played backups in the forth quarter. Millions of people lost money due to mahomes shityy performance
Everytime the refs want to point out every foul or mistakes that the team thats going against the chiefs thats every time.
"That defense was incredible, Mahomes got picked off almost the entire time in the first half and got basically let go in the second half with that huge lead"
I think this may be the end of the mahomes era. The defense has been carrying him the last two years. Its going to catch up
one thing America is united on....the chiefs losing LOL
I Was Waiting for DeAndre To Give His Mother His First Ever Superbowl TD
I don't see any other perfect time for one to invest into crypto specifically XAI315K than now. Buy and Hold XAI315K now.
even on hi-lites Brady is horrible.
"mahomes was seeing ghosts in first half, awful 2 interceptions, if he just stayed in pocket and throw checkdowns, his team would still have chance to comeback in the second half instead of being down 24 points"
Bug ups to the EAGLES! Chiefs !
Cant believe cheifs didnt win
I hate that state farm is still showing ads even after all they did
"I dont watch a lot of football, but from watching highlights I've realised how much more fun football would be to watch if you couldn't punt"
THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS STATS CHEATS DON'T WORK TODAY
Great to see the GOAT at the game.
Why is nobody talking about how atrocious this scoreboard is??
"When the announcer says ""could it be the dagger?"" Like bro it's 33-0 what you mean final dagger"
"On behalf of every abroad Nfl fans, thank you Philly. Justice was made, KC Cheats can't keep getting away with it"
Philly D was too good for Mahomes and chiefs.
A.J. BROWN
E-A-G-L-E-S!!!! This game was the worst superbowl to watch with so many commercials. Next year the Pack will be Back.
F the chiirfs
@13:12 no one's talking about the perfect pass to the ref who maintains his Touchdown arms!
Nick siriani Destroyed the Kansas City thiefs
"that push from the 2 for a touchdown mustve been tough to watch if you are watching in Buffalo (and yes thats how you do it, just saying)"
"Brady is the worst announcer in football, and Im not saying that because I dislike Brady, before I knew who it was this year I thought he was awful. Please make him stop, I listen to all the games in Spanish now"
"The Eagles are ""dynasty"" kryptonite. They said nope to the favoritism and Chiefs are nothing without it. Philly once again played for the sport and it's genuine players, like MVP Josh Allen. Fans of football, not celebrity, got their win."
Mahomes getting them Bucs PTSD renewed.
"If you watched the movie ""The Longest Yard"" Mahomes clearly point shaving hahahahah"
They planned for saquon too much
"The refs tried so hard for KC, and even that couldn't help them win lol"
"Its always satisfying to hear the commentators, especially Brady, lose enthusiasm. I wish collinsworth was calling it too..hes number 1 media mahomes fanboy"
BTA Go Birds
15:56 that hit was crazy.
it was 34-0 b4 they be scoring! Wow!
Never thought I'd say this but thank God for the Philadelphia Eagles.
"15:45 as a certified Mahomes hater, I replayed that play way too many times. THANK YOU EAGLES!!!"
Mahomes more like Mahomo
Jalen should NOT have been MVP Eagles D-Line was MVP
CAN WE HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT CHIEF'S OFFENSIVE LINE?
"No wonder all the Chiefs ""Fans"" were so quiet very early! They jumped off the bandwagon! Lamebook was empty!"
it was 34-0 yall come back next year
Buffalo would have played more competitively than this Chiefs team did.
It was a good game.
The eagles were the better team the entire team. Media would never want you to know that though.
Montana is better never disrespect him with this pick merchant again
Market is starting to rally - excellent time to setup your xAI wallet. Big gains incoming
Market is starting to rally - excellent time to setup your xAI wallet. Big gains incoming
GO BIRDSSSS
"Basically the 2024 Cowboys vs Packers playoff game, but Super Bowl and the referees arent there to help."
"Fock my homeboy, the National Fake League is saved for now. Focking refs are a disgrace , american sports are becoming entertainment like the WWE. GO EAGLES"
Brady thrashed Mahomes with Tampa in the same fashion. Commenting this game must've been fun to him as the whole world witnessed beating of the self-proclaimed goat.
"I'm a Korean who doesn't know anything about the NFL, but I think the defense team is MVP."
That boy Worthy
Thats what happens when you get carried all the way to the super bowl by the refs fake goat raf assisted confirmed sit Patrick mcflop
Eagles got weapons
6:58 Congrats to Chiefs tackle #66 on his assist for sacking his own QB! Mahomes wouldve broke away if he didnt run into him
19 minute highlights? Why not just post the whole thing lol
chief could of tied to OT if eagles played those last 25 sec
Thank you for putting k dot on fr
So satisfying to watch mahomes get hit and flags not get thrown
"i as a german watched football live for the first time this year and was also the last time... The game football is quite nice but boy... More ads watched on this game than the last 3 years combined. Basically, it was a long advertisement punctuated by a music performance and the occasional people throwing a ball. The first and definitely the last time.. what a sh.. show"
Icl that touch down by devonte smith was actually crazy
Fifa world cup Only!!!
Mahome can't surpasse Tom Brady !
If you aren't invested into XAI315K by now you'll miss a huge train you wish you were on...
15:44 fumble!!!!!!!!!
too bad the eagles stopped playing and chiefs got 16 points in the last quarter.
SB too big for Mahomes and Kelce.
Andy Reid deserves this humiliation as he treated the final regular season game as training camp getting destroyed 38-0 by the Broncos with backup QB Carson Wentz under center.
The Eagles D is the MVP but great for Hurts
XAI315K = Millionaire Maker
Man! EVERYTHING went the Eagles way! Great defense Eagles!
This has to be a legacy dent on Mahomes Resume. The guys 3-2 now but the 2 Losses he looks a shell of himself. This one was way worse and I think the Philly defense took pity on him with those late TDs. We could of had a record 37 blow out in super bowl history.
MAHCHOKES
as a falcon fans.... thank you eagles.
2 blowout loss for Mahomes with multiple ints. Brady never got blown out in his 3 SB losses.
KC would have came back and won - if Brady had put down the microphone and suited up for KC to start the 2nd half. KC is stuck w some kid named Mahomes - the QB that doesn't have very good mechanics - and it caught up w him today. TB - the greatest.
Them last 2 Chiefs TDs was like giving a pregnant woman a Plan B
Best game in Super Bowl history
14:05 he clearly stepped over the line of scrimmage
14:13 totally in front of the line of scrimmage
Not even the refs could save the chiefs this gamethey tried though haha
guess the refs were to scared to cheat for the chiefs since they got called out so much for it.
How the chiefs O-Line got man handle was just a thing of beauty
Big eagles bih #941
THANK GODDD! poor lil chiefs fans. Thats what it looks like when your QB gives up on you in the middle of the game.
"Too bad, I was hoping the Chiefs could win their third consecutive Super Bowl. Well done Eagles"
"as a relatively new nfl fan, I can confidently say that Jalen Hurts put on the best performance ive ever seen"
The Eagles won the Superbowl with a DOMINATING running back and a DOMINATING defense. Does this change how teams build moving forward?
The refs tried to help the Chiefs with the pass interference call /brown.
I think they paid people to comment that game was super rigged Mahomes wasn't even looking like he was trying and you think they gonna let a black man get a threepeat come on it would make Brady look bad
All timer hate watch - Patriots fan
I feel soo bad for Taylor Swift and her minions.
That Super Bowl logo conspiracy turned out to be accurate this year wow
No more demonic TS
18:14 why was Xavier mad
Mahomes is washed up. He should just retire.
"Hey Chiefs and Chiefs fans, not so great when those bs penalties get called AGAINST you, is it??"
W
"The sound editing is bad. Otherwise, thank you for the upload."
Congrats eaglessss
"What a performance from the eagles defense, thank you coming from a niner fan well deserved."
Mahomes the goat? Shut up. Brady would never get blown out in a sb
I'm not surprised. A number of Chiefs games this past season were very close. Besides their luck running out the Eagles defense was really something. Most Super Bowl winners thru the years had a great defense.
Eagles defense dominated. What a year to be an Eagles fan. Thank God for Saquon. He glues the team together.
"Defense should be the MVP, they hold and destroy the offensive line"
Philly front four curb stomped Chiefs offense. Refs had no chance
The Eagles did it they really did it they won for everyone
Everyone in the US feels just a tad bit better after this
Game was still rigged
All my savings almost all went into XAI315K crypto and i could not be happier
It was over by halftime.
"PHILLY HAS A REASON TO ""FLY EAGLES FLY"". That is how it's done. The city of BROTHERLY LOVE IS WIDE AWAKE AGAIN."
Nick Wright calling in sick tomorrow
My birds got CLAMPS!
The better team lost today. The eagles were helped by the nfl and Vegas. We know who's the real Champs. Not the beagles
Amazing
Need to see nick wright Monday..
Fly Eagles Fly Baby Whoooo!!!
Hahaha amazing how the chiefs shows their true colors when they cant have the refs cheat for them.
"The Chiefs dont always lose the Super Bowl, but when they do they get blown out."
"#68 for the Eagles, Jordan Mailata becomes the FIRST AUSSIE to win a Superbowl Ring! Congratulations to the entire Eagles Team, all the coaching staff and the Owners! Luv from SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA! M"
"Ugh, I was gonna bet all in on eagles but an American persuaded me Kansas will win. Next time just gonna trust my gut. gg eagles."
welcome to Champions
Im so happy for jalen hurts long time coming from his time at Alabama to now and such a outstanding person he deserves it all
"Congrats to the Eagles for taking it out of the Refs hands! Something my 9ers werent able to do in two attempts. Gotta put the game away when you have the chance because if you dont, the Refs (NFL) will give them every opportunity to win! Gotta keep those Swifties that dont care about football watching!"
"Congratulations Eagles. Patrick Homes looked like Jared Goff of the Lion's. Fumble, interceptions, sacks. Loved every minute of it. Boo Hoo Taylor Swift.! Your Boy did virtually nothing.!"
"Come sono contento che la squadra del Kansas Chiefs abbia perso. Troppa fortuna negli anni scorsi, Philadelphia avrebbe dovuto infierire di pi! Una difesa formidabile"
"The Eagles, Chiefs and Cowboys are the most unlikable teams in the face of the earth. But I'm sure glad Mahomes lost, he has a punchable face my gawd!"
Nvidia partnership is in near sight for XAI315K? Elon's Crypto Token about to 500x
"man you love to see it, queefs fans are the worst fanbase out there"
"Thank you, Eagles! No SB for Kermit, Swifties and the other bums"
I KNOW KOBE IS CELEBRATING NOW IN HEAVEN
"I still believe NFL rigged this game, make it appear they do not rig games by forcing chiefs to lose. How convenient when everyone starting understand rigging was happening; National Fix League."
"As a 49ers fan, thank you Eagles. That awesome game."
As a South African I watched the SuperBowl on ESPN and I was disgusted by the referring so I just stopped watching from there onwards might just start watching again...
D-Line was the real MVP. The Big Green Monsters.
"Eagles D line was ruthless this game, they deserved the MVP as a whole. Mahomes was pressured basically the entire game and he didnt have the sorts of opportunities he usually has. The pressure was too much for the cheating chiefs and Mahomes folded on one too many occasions. What a game tonight.."
Two of the best long overhead touchdowns I've ever seen in one game Mahomes as talented as he is looked like a schoolkid playing against adults at times well done Eagles from the UK you clearly wanted it more.
"""Theres Only Been One Goat, Only Ever Gonna Be One Goat""- Tom Brady."
"The Eagles have done it , let's gooooooooooooo"
Best Superbowl ever. FLY EAGLES FLY
"They have always said that defenses win championships. NEVER in the history of the game was this more evident than this super bowl. Although the ravens defense played lights out in their win against the giants, the giants had a nobody at quarterback. What a defensive performance by the eagles. Andy Reid and Patrick MaHomes had no answeres. Congrats to the eagles on putting that defense together ! !"
Congrats to the Eagles
"Thank you, Eagles... thank you"
Salute to the eagles and their fans.
Well Done Eagles The World Thanks You
BEAUTIFUL!!! Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles!! You deserve this win!!!
Sad
"God is good, I believe in miracles"
Hurts is the first true running QB to win it all.
A Giants fan says CONGRATULATIONS EAGLES!!Great win for your team.
Im totally being a prisoner of the moment but this is the best/my favorite team of all time
One of the worst super bowls of all time. Blowout during the game and the halftime performance was mid
Are yall millenials finally over this fake goat talk! YALL SO YOUNG YALL BRAIN AINT DEVELOPED YET
Stop being hesitant and invest in Elon Musk's new crypto XAI315K
Trade Patrick Mahomes
"This isnt an anomaly for the Chiefs, this is proof that without the refs theyre just a mid team."
NO MORE GOAT TALK FOR MAHOMES....NOW HAS 2 OF THE ALL TIME WORST PERFORMANCES IN A SUPER BOWL....
Mahomes looking like Prime Lebron in 2011 NBA finals
God bless you and thanks for the intel as usualy. $XAI315K will be a millionaire maker this crypto cycle.
"The Chiefs rode their luck all season long winning games they perhaps should have lost, last night the luck ran out and the better team won by putting in a team effort, there were no gaudy stats or spectacular plays but the Eagles played like a team."
For anyone wondering how the Chiefs could play this poorly: when youre not protected by biased reffing then you have to actually step up yourself. They failed.
KC got KOed by the Birds!
"this was the best football game i've seen in a long time. finally, choked the F out of the Chiefs!"
This game was rigged
No refs no party
Im not an eagles fan but i have to thank you guys for this win/championship. Well done Eagles
Can we give Vic Fangio his props? Great plan plus motivated his defense to win.
This was an all time beat down for the ages. Until the eagles pulled their starters the Chiefs had 6 points and under 150yds of total offense.
The score graphics are hurting my eyes
Was rooting for the meteor strike but I guess this works too
Isn't this Rugby?
The Eagles Defense was Phenomenal
Cooper Dejean is corner back 1
"Dont let the score fool you, Philly had back ups in at the end. No 3 peat tonight KC. Very quiet in the kingdom."
Most Chiefs fans are past Patriots fans when the Pats were hot. It's no way they have this many fans. Hope this loss will get rid of most of you bandwagon Jumper's. And when the Kansas City Chiefs eventually go back in the toilet y'all can hop on the next team that is hot. But for now you can enjoy your humble pie! Go Bucs! And congratulations to the Eagles winning the Superbowl!
How was that a false start?
Mahomes clearly through the game.. He's been point shaving all season
"And people wonder why I don't watch the NFL. Any given superbowl has been a blow out. In the 50 some Bowl games, over 80% have been won by 21 points or more. And many of those were decided before halftime."
"Watching mahomes and cheaf, I mean chiefs players crying it was one of the most satisfying moments of this game"
"love how this is still all about the chiefs! nobody cares the eagles won, only that the chiefs lost... They will be back in the SB in 2026"
When the game is called fairly the Chiefs go down 34-0
"Yayyyy, another year of insufferable fan bases from both sides since they both made the SB. This is a loss for everyone"
I wouldn't have thought highlights of this game would be 19 minutes long.
Oh dear what a f#%king shame
Tragic
Eagles obliterated the cheifs
Idk why people think eagles fans are the worst? Like who cares. All fans are the same. This was awesome to see a dynasty be completely shut out.
14:14 mahomes was obviously past the line of scrimmage
That eagle defense reminded me of the Tampa superbowl team. Shutting down. GG
There were atleast like 4 bad call in this game bruh.
"As a 49ers fan, Eagles well Done!!! Congrats on the S.B win!"
"When the Chiefs lose, America wins"
"Travis kelsee, on the sidelines Sniveling. That was golden."
"Queefs got banished to the Shadow Realm. Thanks, Philly! RN4L"
"Eagles Flying high in, capturing the Superbowl with a dominant defence performance shutting out Chiefs Offence of three quarters,allowing Hurts to chalk up points on the scoreboard,finally breaking Chiefs hold on the Superbowl,game highlights...."
Chiefs are the best team in football
"In 3 months,every qb in the league will be better than the super bowl winning Jalen Hurts... again. Rodney Dangerfield of football. I'm sure if he threw for 6 tds,500 yards,rushed for 200yds and 2 more tds .he still will be overlooked."
:(
That hit @ 15:46 is wild bro is gonna feel that tomorrow
This will only make the Chiefs stronger. a motivated frint office; the 3 peat begins in 2026
"Im so proud and happy for Kellen Moore to get a ring , as an Idahoan this brings me joy"
I was impressed with the E-A-G-L-E-S crowd .
Got it back in blood
Can't believe I missed out on BTC early years but I won't miss XAI315K. Thanks for the heads up!
Good game
The scoreboard overlay was somewhat distracting
"It's just a game people, are they paying any of y'all bills, who cares if it's rigged or not, hell the whole world is rigged, with bs so doesn't matter lol"
The Chiefs learned it is a lot harder to win when its 11 on 11.
Eagles defense really locked down mahomes.
"Jalen set example to every athletes, spoke softly after winning and praised everyone for the efforts. As for Aaron Rodgers, he would upsell himself"
"Officiating was still NOT GOOD. Stop making lame calls. Hey guys we dont fix our games, look we give advantageous calls to other teams too!"
Sorry Mahomes No help for you this time and Great game by the Eagles defense
As a cowboys fan thank you phili
Thank god
The Chiefs have been exposed for the frauds theyve always been. Refs couldnt bail em out this time!
Just a thought if a person to cover the cost of Super Bowl Tickets bet big on the Chiefs to win and brag about this to his friends at the Bar.
Budweiser commercial sucked this year
Fly eagles fly ! On the road to victory !
Investigate mahomes for match fixing
There's absolutely no way you can squeeze 20 minutes worth of highlights from this game lmao
The Eagles defense clearly won this game.
Faith restored
If only the Chiefs still had Tyreek Hill.
NFL made sure they put both controversial flags in the highlights
"As someone who started watching NFL this season, thank you Eagles for restoring my faith in this game."
As a 49er fan this game was bittersweet yeah the chiefs lost but the eagles won pick your poison thank you eagles from a 49er fan i still hate you
THIS IS SO SATISFYING TO WATCH. CONGRATS EAGLES! Congrats cooper and Jalen
The MVP of this game should have been the entire Eagle defense.
"As a 49ers fan, thank god that somebody took down le refs, good job eagles.."
Iggles fans KNEW the team was loaded. It's amazing how many national experts picked the Chiefs.
"Beat Down, Eagles are young and Expect to Dominate putting the league on notice I will follow up after the Parade."
"The Eagles were the far better roster, better team. The most disrespected team in the nfl proved everyone wrong every week. Jalen Hurts is a Super Bowl Champion and MVP. Give them the respect they deserve"
I didn't want the Chiefs to win but on the real one of the biggest rigged games I ever seen....
Ty eagles. From a raiders fan
"This is hilarious, so much holding by the Eagles O-line and yet they only got called for it one time the entire game. So much for that BS narrative of the refs helping KC, you got to see how the refs screw KC every game"
I have been waiting 2 years for this highlight reel.
The reffs bet everything on the eagles since they weren't allowed to help them
OJ McSnuffy
Tom Brady needs to step down from the booth
"Htalks addictions and Media Giant fans, welcome!!"
"This was without a doubt one of the most dominating defensive effort I have ever seen in the Super Bowl. If you don't think defenses win championships, then watch this game again, it will 100% change your mind."
I love how Kendrick's Half Time Show has more views than the actual highlights
CONGRATS TO THE WORLD CHAMPIONS PHILLY EAGLES. I am so glad they ended the Kansas City winning streak. Patrick Mahomes is a little bit too into himself. This loss will hopefully bring him down to earth and make the Cheifs understand they can be beat !
EAGLES DEATED THE TOP TEAM AGAIN!!
"'make it a 5 possession game"" LMAO"
"I don't know much about American Eggball (jocking guys) because I'm a football (what you call soccer) fan, but the ""KC"" team...where were there minds? Almost 3 rounds without points? I have seen losses, but this one, as a final game, was one of the worst. It was joyful to watch, I think Iwill watch more of that"
The Eagles always get revenge on teams that beat them in the Super Bowl
Lo isieron manita de puerco a kansas
Total domination by the Eagles. Congratulations
"As a bengals fan, thank you to the eagles <33"
"I haven't watched an NFL game in over 10 yrs. But for some reason, I tuned in on this one and I was so glad I did. It was so great to see Mahomes have his head handed to him on a silver platter. I turned it off going into the 4th quarter because I knew that the Chiefs would do much better...against the 2nd. and 3rd. string Eagles defense."
Tomorrow's video: Philly burned to the ground by fans celebrating Super Bowl victory.
I refused to watch it on tv. What an AMAZING game!!! Go Eagles!!!
The defense was impressive
Philly D-line been training in Denver.
Rocky arc completed
FLY EAGLES FLY BABY!! I am so hype!!!
Thank you Philly!!!
the L is for lame.
All the salty Philly Fans in the comments hate the chiefs so much they cant even enjoy thier own superbowl win. lol chiefs will be back in the Super Bowl next year... its all good in KC
"I hate the eagles, but not as much as I hate the chiefs and mahomo. So from New England, thank you Philly. Well deserved win"
Eagles defensive front 4 DOMINATED!! Champs again! Go Birds!
Vegas win Big ! Rigged probably
Shovel pass at 14:13 was past the line of scrimmage - didn't catch that during the game. LOL
I had a feeling the eagles were going to win because no team has had a three peat in the superbowl
Wow the Chiefs don't look so good when the refs don't help them.
"Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert who? Jalen Hurts."
Real score is 40-6
Wow ..turns out Mahomes is just average when he gets some pressure ..kind of like every other QB in the league ..
That loser security guard still has a JOB Eagles Next time SF players should knocked his block off
2045 anyone ?
That halftime show was dreadful
Reports of domestic violence at the Kelce household.
"God, Kelce cannot block at all.. You can just walk around him and he'll let you."
Chiefs got MANHANDLED without the refs
this game is like the times when those early game bosses become the regular enemies and they're easy to take down. Hurts finally leveled up and got his D-Line stats up lol
Let's Go Eagles! I guess the MaHomes referees couldn't stop the Eagles onslaught hahahahahaha
Toooooomuch for the chifities (Ace)
SCREWED MY PRIZEPICKS!!!! WTF KC???
Chiefs didn't have enough ref help this time.
Now this is what I call satisfying Top class fans as well for making this extra special
WORST SCOREBOARD OF ALL TIME !!!
kansas city hancur lebur
8:00 pause
"I'm glad Chiefs lost. They had been so much favored. Now, this is TOO BIG TO RIG!"
The Bills fan's were definitely watching this one
Tom Brady is the GOAT
"As an Eagles fan, this game was blissfully boring!"
"Refs help, barkley ghosted, MVP goes to the defence, Mahomes folded earlier. Oh well now its time for yall stop stop crying about the cheifs and Swift its old and pathetic now move on softies"
Chiefs have been exposed
"Aww, no Taylor Swift and Travis Kielce engagement"
Kevin Burkhart was glazing Mahomes
"The scripted NFL is over, the NFL is real again"
BTA
Mahomes the goat definitely not yet
ya ay eagles representing for the whole NFL except the swifties let's go eagle's let's go Broncos!!
This couldve easily been 50 if the eagles were passing and even trying in the last quarter.
Nothing makes me happy than to see Eagles end Cheifs streak Congrats to The Eagles Team and their fans
Eagles were all over Mahomes like Lion on a Wildabeast rear.-
Both of Carson Wentz' former backups got superbowl mvp before him
Has Swift dumped Kelce yet?
"the scoreline is a lie, the game ended at 34 to nothing!"
Chiefs are lucky to have had points... Abysmal
Glad Mr. Swift lost. Sorry.
another philly special thank you eagles!
One of the greatest defense's OF ALL TIME BIRDGANGGGGGGG
"YES, I was rooting for the Eagles."
Chiefs couldn't get busy till Eagles 4th string got in
"Commanders vs Eagles, week 1, 2025"
Chiefs will be back next year
Vic Fangio should be the mvp That defense was impressive! Fly Eagles Fly!
Rip Nick Wright
Ill say his name!!!! JAKE ELLIOT IS HIM!!! Great job turning things around!
"THANK YOU, PHILLY! As a Bills fan I was cheering for you haha, go Eagles, go Flyers, umm, I don't know any other Philadelphia teams, but congrats."
Highlight reel was great. Hurts was great. The Eagles defense was phenomenal.
"Everyone talking about Mahomes vs Allen rivalry, but the real rivalry is Mahomes vs Hurts."
15:43 first time an nfl game has aroused me
Boring Super Bowl. Completely one sided. At least Kendrick did his thing.
FYI in 2015 eagles defense coordinator was the Broncos defensive coordinator and won the Super Bowl 2015 against the Panthers. Youre welcome.
I vote MVP is Phili D coordinator. He found something on film and they beat the Chiefs over the head with it all night long.
"Oh well, as a Chiefs fan, the fact we even had an opportunity to three-peat is a feat in and of itself, It takes a division rival to stack an NFC team to beat us. I'll take that as a win, we'll be back!"
"The most clinical performance ever, cheifs deserved this humbling, fly eagles fly"
"As a 49ers fan, I just wanna say thank you Eagles for taking down Goliath, we had our chances but you guys got the job done,loved every minute of it. Congrats Much respect."
/ / / / / / / (.124)
Half time show
Go Eagles! Congratulations!!!
Just the way i dreamed the chiefs loosing Thank you Eagles for making my dream come true
"Not gon lie, I would've never seen this coming. KC got smashed smfhhh"
Kansas City just got exposed. Big time.
What is a chief kingdom?
"Philly had a great year, has a great team!! And I love seeing how they smashed mahomo and the chiefs! This is what the chiefs look like when the refs arent giving them all of the flags huh !? Nothing special as assumed!"
make the full game highlight
Eagles D-line is super. They shutdown those cocky ones big time....
Somewhere Vince Papale is smiling.
Way toooooo gooooo Eagles. Gbwy.
"So happy for Jalen Hurts. All the doubters in the media are struggling to give him his flowers, but he just keeps proving everyone wrong, like he always has. Super Bowl MVP? Josh Allen doesn't have one, neither does Lamar, Burrow or any of the other media darling QBs besides Mahomes. He's proven twice now that he's clutch when it counts and he is a top 3 QB. No question."
I loved seeing mahomes throw two ints and get smacked so hard he lost a fumble they were never a dynasty but their little run is over!
FLY EAGLES FLY
The worst halftime show ever... Horrible
"The Birds thoroughly deserved their convincing win, despite the media and referee's obvious bias."
"Here's thing that the Eagles and Bucs did to beat the Chiefs. Your front four better dominant and bully that offensive line which the Eagles did. The Eagles BLITZED ZERO TIMES!! ZERO! and got those turnovers and had a 34-0 lead at one point. Talk about helping your offensive out there. This is is like a bully (Eagles defense) beating up on a weak kid (the Chiefs offense) and then letting up a little before the teacher (the end of the game) comes in. The weak kid tries to throw a punch or two but it does nothing towards the bully. The Eagles were the better team by far and it showed. So for the rest of the NFL, if you want to beat the Chiefs, your front four better kick the s out of the Chiefs offensive line and get to Mahomes."
I'm not an expert on American football but that Eagles defensive line was just an absolute machine. Awesome work. Congratulations Eagles.
VIC FANGIO WON THE SUPERBOWL.
7:40 The unthinkable. A penalty against Kansas City with a significant effect on team momentum.
To the Kansas City fan shouting at me last week in the gym locker room When I told him the Eagles would win
They didnt pay enough money to the refs this time around! Fly Eagles Fly
The buccaneers & eagles are the only two teams who gave other 30 teams the blueprint for beating Patrick Mahomes and the chiefs in a superbowl. Congrats Philly. They definitely deserve it
"Steve spagnolo this, Andy reid that ? Eagles cant ..this eagles cant that...yall didnt know anything that you were mouthing off about. All the So called experts .LOL THE BEST PART.IS......THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE THE BEST TEAM IN FOOTBALL..!!! AND SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS !! How ya like that stat ?"
American sports have the worst endings to games. Even when its close theyre terrible
So glad Taylor swift lost again!
Eagles defense was on a mean one ! Won them the Super Bowl.
Go eagles Bro ts is scripted yall zoom in close to linemans its like the chiefs defensive line is acting like theyre struggling ts script bro Im sorry
"When the Chiefs lost against the Bucs in the 2021 Super Bowl, I gave them a pass because they had a banged up O-line and Andy Reids son died of a drug overdose during prep week. This blowout loss is completely UNACCEPTABLE and plain EMBARRASSING"
mahomes is not the goat
"If you think about it, the Chiefs had kinks in their armor all season. The Eagles exposed them in this game."
From the looks of these highlights. (I did not watch the game.) Mahomes did not have his starting ref lineup.
"The karma is done, after the game they stoled vs the Bills"
Its going to be a tradition coming every time they lose.
"Mahomes is not TB 12, confirmed."
13:12 lol that catch by the ref
NOW THAT WE LOMBARDI TROPHY i can take down my christmas
Glad I watched highlights not seen Taylor swift once happy days great to see the chiefs get dealt with well done eagles
haven't seen a spanking like that since I got a call from the police when they caught my son TPing a house.
So annoying how they refer to players by their first name.
Too big to rig lol
Thank u eagles
'04 loss against the Pats: Avenged '22 loss against the Chiefs: Avenged We now just need the Raiders to make it back to the SB to avenge the 1980 SB loss Go Birds!!!
F the chiefs frs
Thank you Eagles
This is what happens when the NFL manipulate things to get a team into the SB that have absolutely no business being there. Embarrassing.
"The cheats have no mental fortitude. The moment things dont go your way, you retreat mentally and lose. Justice is served!"
Vegas made a lot of money on this game.
Mahommes..not as tough as you thought are you..inspite of bad calls against the Eagles you still lost..I guess your head coach didn't give the officials enough money to swing the game in your favour..oh..and the Eagles defense showed you what artificial turf tastes like..five sacks and three picks..I think that's a super bowl record isnt
This highlight was 80% Eagles FLY EAGLES FLY
There's a bunch of ppl in the media chewing on their own feet after this performance by Jalen. Go Birds
Completely shut down Barkley and still allowed 40 points
Bro let's talk about how many times Mahomes got sacked
Mahomes should've called Brady on 4th quarter.
SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!!!
There will be No Three Pete Lol Thank you Eagles
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT IN PHILY
We wanted it baaaaad!! And we didn't let Mahomes run crazy like the last time they met! Huge props to the defense!! Hungry dogs! Can't describe how proud I am of this team!!
Im not a fan of either team but Defense wins Championships. The Eagles Defense dismantled the Chiefs Offense and completely rattled Mahomes. Pure bliss if you ask me.
1:30 was a good call. You can't stiff arm if you don't have the ball.
We had that double birthday buff GGs
Glad to see hurts get this win. Been a fan of his since the bama days. Was fun to see mahomes and the chiefs get stomped.
Now we need the Phillies and 76ers to make the triple crown
Thank god.
LETS GO EAGLES
A good ole fayshion buttwhoopin'.
Hmmm....wondered why they didn't show TS every Chiefs play. I love it.
Down goes Frazer down goes mahomes
60% up on XAI315K and it's just presale. Wait till it goes live KABOOM
now they know what it feels like to not have calls to go their way
"The announcers, "" the Chief's are one of the greatest dynasties in NFL history."" ""The Eagles just got their 6th sack of the game."" Anyway, Patrick Mahomes is absolutely amazing."""
Anyone else see mahomo shovel that pass over the line of scrimmage
The NFL tried to give the Chiefs the game and still failed
Thanks from Raiders nation
Soo.... Dotson TD was $10 to win $1000 omg
amazing how Chiefs lose when the refs dont interfer
Yeah if the chiefs come back they will certainly lose again just being honest
Invest into XAI315K if you want to retire early. Mark my words
Good officiating gives fair results. Great game.
"Even though Saquan probably didnt have the game he wanted he still got an ALL-TIME RECORD and SUPER BOWL WIN on his birthday, congrats"
Not as close as the score indicated.
Who else is glad them at someone FINALLY ended the chiefs streak?
Speechless. Did the Eagles really just do that?! Im still picking my jaw off the floor!
the eagles destroyed them
You can beat the chiefs by pressuring mahomes so that mean get youre self a beasty D line
What happen Kansas City?
"That touchdown pass from Hurts to Devonte Smith was perfect and poetic. Congratulations to all the Bama - Eagles players and to Smith for being the first player drafted from Alabama to score a Super Bowl touchdown. I cant believe it took this long for that feat to be accomplished but its great nonetheless,,."
"Mahomes was average this season as compared to many other NFL QB's, just look at his stats. They got across the line in key games with flagged penalties. Today, with all being equal, the Chiefs showed how average they were despite the NFL push for them to 3-peat. Hurts completely outclassed Mahomes today. Congratulations Eagles."
I don't think I ever seen mahomo get hit so much and so hard. This is how your season would have looked without the refs carrying the chiefs.
Defense wins championships
God is good -Jaylen Hurts- Yes!!! Yes he is.
Chiefs Oline was out classed! Congrats to the Eagles for a stellar performance! Tough lose for the Chiefs! Im sad!
"Yes, the gap is too much for refs to fill this time. So glad finally Chiefs and refs got beat!"
Wow
A Niners fan here. Thank you so much!
So did Taylor Swift win the Super Bowl? I thought this was supposed to be a rigged game???
I HATE KC AND PHILLY
FLY EAGLES FLY 2x SUPER BOWL CHAMPS AND feel THE POWERRR!!!! IT'S A NEW DAY YES IT IS
Number of time Taylor Swift was on screen in 2024: countless Number of time Taylor Swift was on screen in 2025: 1 Thank you Eagles
"Wish the Bills would have played, might have been a better game."
The real score is 40-6. The Eagles played a bunch of 2nd string players at the end and they knew they were winning so they were avoiding injuries. Eagles D destroyed KC's offense.
Look at mahomes waoooowww running around down by 4 TDS lol
"This was an absolute BLOWOUT. For the score to show 22 points makes it seem like it was even a game, nah Absolute domination by the Eagles. Congrats and thank you from all NFL fans"
This reminds me of the summer down at the cottage at 1 am in the morning.. Mahomes fans are *Crickets*
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles. They surprised the hell out of me. All you folks in Philadelphia make sure to do you celebrating on the ground. Leave the light poles alone.
So this is what if looks like when the Chiefs dont get help from the refs
All of you out there that said the Chiefs were going to win because the NFL is rigged and the refs were helping them sure look even more stupid than you did before.
"I told my wife how it was going to play out. Nailed it 100%. Now that the NFL is rigged, it doesnt matter who wins from now on, but curious to see what they are going to do now. It was fun to see how everyone, including all commentators were following the script. To. The. Letter."
this is what happens when the refs dont help the chiefs.
Super
i love how they mentioned a stat that saying that Mahomes is 0-4 against brady in the playoffs
WAS fan. Congrats to the PHI on their Super Bowl season. Well deserved. Can't wait to battle you guys next season.
Seeing Mahomes get absolutely rocked made me so happy man.
Chiefs o-line sold
"NFL got what they wanted with favorable calls for KC against Buffalo and very obivous KC did not deserve to be there, so the NFL failed to crown PM the GOAT. Maybe they will tell the refs to call it accurately in the future, although I won't be watching what I think was a sham this year with KC."
Chiefs proved they didn't belong in the Superbowl
Go birds go
That shovel pass from Mahomes to Kelce @14:10 is definitely an illegal forward pass. was it not??? I saw it live and was like huh???? lol LETS GO EAGLES!!!!
How the hell did Jalen hurts win the MvP
"yes yes yes, i"
Confirmed: Mahomes is not the GOAT. Go home Chiefs bandwagon fans.
To all Cowboys fans: Welcome.... TO HELL!!! BWAA HA HA HA HA HA ha ha ha ha ha.... AAAHH HA HA HA HA HA ha ha ha ha
"I didn't watch this one because how much I loathe the Chiefs and the refs. But, yeah Philly, you did awesome it seems. Thanks!"
13:54 This needs to be a meme.
The only way to beat the Chiefs and not give the referees any chance of helping them.
"Wow, theres so much LOVE here for the Chiefs its really overwhelming, im really touched..... in all the wrong places, Lmao. When I heard Brady rooting for the Chiefs.... I knew deep in my heart, I wanted EVERYTHING they held dear stumped out of them, thank you Philly for not letting the desires of every non-Chief fan go unfulfilled, Lol."
Philadelphia Eagles No.1 Congrats I'm so happy for my favorite NFL Team. I have been an Eagles fan for 21 years
Without the Refs help the Chiefs are not that good
Boring game....
This will be the last superbowl kc will ever be on I'll come back next year so I could prove yall that mohon is good but not that good refs helped them
Bills would have done better
"We the football world, thank you Eagles."
"Chiefs have been beneficiaries of the whistle in every Super Bowl they've won. This is what happens when the games are called correctly. Good job, Eagles. I feel bad for the 49ers for being robbed twice. Glad finally a team beat the Chiefs and their zebras. Enjoy the win, Philadelphia."
Devonta smith in Albama Devonta smith in Philadelphia Hail marry touchdown
Mahomes before the game: Mahomes after: It HURTS.
Weres the taylor swift highlights lol
WE TOLD YOU ..GET OUT OF OUR WAY !! WE COMING TO TAKE WHAT WE WANT... OH BTW WE GOT IT !!
Im sooooooo happy. The greatest revenge in sports history. Fly my eagles fly
cry KC
"Greetings from Europe! Ahhh look. A rugby game mede safer, and then called Football."
Funny how the mediocre team get run out of town when the refs aren't saving them every game. Although the refs did try to help the Kermit
"Somewhere in Philadelphia, Charlie Day is recovering from massive self inflicted injuries."
Fly Eagles Fly!
Great win for the eagles
Eagles vs Bills would have been a much better and more exciting game...
The refs tried to help the chiefs but quickly realized they couldn't do much without making us blatantly obvious. Kansas can't do much without the refs protecting them.
Taylor swift bout to make an ex boyfriend song
Refs couldn't help KC in this one they try but the point up to much 34 / 0 at one time
The score doesnt really tell how dominant the Eagles were. Chiefs got some cheap points at the end. Congrats to the Eagles! What a performance they put on. Hopefully State Farm will end all these Jake and Chief commercials.
"Chief got exposed, could or might be the end. The Commanders and The Bills are coming..."
Thank you Eagles
"XRP, Bitcoin and XAI315K - Top Investments"
Waiting on the micd up
Underdog
that was a blow out
Jake Elliot was lights out tonight.
"Dont really care who won but after watching the highlights and not the game, the game looked rigged."
"This game was absolutely surgical. The Eagles ripped apart the Chiefs on both sides of the ball for 4 full quarters of football. You don't often see a team at the highest level of the game, in the biggest game of the season, play this well, especially as the statistical underdogs. The entire Eagles team deserved this win and showed exactly how strong you can be when you play by the book."
congrats Kelcy Covid
Kc did not play how they usually do. If they would have it would have been a different outcome.
"What, exactly, is a holding penalty? Because when people are tackling other players from behind around the neck, grabbing them in armbars, and... seriously, that crud needs fixed already."
40-6 is diabolical
The UI was garbo. Sry not sry.
I think if the girl scouts had a football team they could have beat the Chiefs on this night.
what a wash
I just got a cut on my skin instead of blood I leaked out green GO EAGLES GO
Woke got smashed tonight and it was so satisfying to see . Swift getting roundly booed was a bonus
"EAGLE DEFENSE, WON THE GAME,,TO NOT GIVE ANY CHANCE TO MAHOMES"
Has the NFL become a bunch of p____sies with these soft calls??
DEFENSES WIN GAMES
"When Jalen ""Hurts"" everyone's feelings"
"Somehow I felt that when the Chiefs came onto the field they had been told, ""we decided this is not your day"""
The refs didn't show up for you Chiefs fans
"my god rugby has so much better athletes ,not only faster, but stronger and tougher. don't wear padding and helmets either. also the game doesn't stop every few seconds. Happy to see Philly win though cos KC are full of silly dancing wannabees. Philadelphia Eagles looked more professional to me though for some reason the qb got nervous and had no runners, but kc were awful lol good job. But seriously if you want to see a real game watch the 6 nations england verses france. or any of the rugby championship."
Should have spent less time on the Bundle-rooski and more time on the All-22-rooski
Tom Brady and Joe Montanas legacies still stand. Hes the third best quarterback of all time Patrick Mahomes will never be the goat He had a good run though
I often wondered about some of the MVP Super Bowl picks especially a couple that Brady won but since they don't give it to a whole unit like the Eagles defense which played an incredible game Jalen Hurts took advantage of their great play to throw a 40 spot on the KC defense very efficiently. He truly deserves the MVP!
the most clear roughing the passer play not called on the Eagles after the ball was already out and he got fully hammered in the face. Interesting lol
"See what happens when the game is called fairly? The Chiefs look like an average team that was outmanned, outclassed and out coached."
"14:20 game over, stat padding begins"
Kinda different team when you dont get your 2 or 3 ghost flags. F the chefs. Almost as much as the refs.
Makes you wonder how the Chiefs even got to the game
Jalen and the eagles deserved the win
The way they coddle the QBs I'm surprised they didn't penalize the Eagles for the hit on Mahomes when he was stripped of the ball.
Now Philly starts winning 1 and 2 Superbowls all the hate will go from KC to Philadelphia
@14:13 give kc the play
Im thrilled that it was Philly to give the chiefs the beat down they deserve
The first SB of the Next 2
Only the smart ones are investing in XAI315K now. AI is the future
"i thought the scorebug is too ""televised high school game"""
"You only play as well as your opposition lets you. WOW Eagles, great job Chiefs were outplayed, its simple as that"
Eagles are World Champs!! Best early Birthday Gift Ever!! Go Birds !!!
"L bozos. Screw the chiefs. I don't like them but, for today, fly eagles fly o7"
I miss football already
Bravo Eagles
Thank you Eagles this was amazing! Fly Eagles Fly!
I usually dont enjoy a blowout but this was great.
Sweat shudda got MVP foo had a massive game
FLY EAGLES FLY!!! SB LIX CHAMPS!!
Used up all there free play cards before the superbowl
Congrats Philly well deserved!!!
"This is great for losers everywhere. Now we can look to Kelece and Taylor Swift and say hey, she loves a loser just like me. She's in my league"
"Thank you Eagles, America wants to thank you"
Why can't the NFL be original and reward the MVP to the Eagles Defensive Line?
Hyper Defense
E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!!!
Their luck finally ran out. That mediocre team had no business in the super bowl. All those lucky wins had people believing they were a good team. That's a bad offense of team.
Was a beautiful day...from a Steele's fan
Super Bowl LIX Eagles def. Chiefs 40-22!!!! 2-9-25 Saquon Barkley turns 28 Cooper DeJean turns 22 Saquon Barkley's 28th Birthday Cooper DeJean's 22nd Birthday Your Super Bowl LIX Champions... The PHILADELPHIA EAGLES!!!!!! The Eagles win their 2nd Super Bowl Champions since 2018
Fozzie Bear was laughing too! lol.
Great game for best team wins glad watch it best wishes to all of you
NFC East is the ONLY division with Super Bowl Champions across the board. And now they all have at least 2!! :D
Tge chiefs got kocked out because the scorebug looks like it said KO.
9:55 did my boi Jalyx Hunt accidentally punched the ref? hahaha
"The commentating on this game is absolutely abysmal. Multiple very obvious penalties from the Chiefs were discarded as incorrect, when they very obviously were blatant. Kiss the ring I guess. Glad the chiefs lost."
Thank goodness!!
Most boring superbowl up there wid the seahawks blowout on the broncos but i loved every second of it watching mahomes get destroyed and no flags thrown that jus shows me hes scared when teams are actually allowed to hit him
The Eagles were in control the entire game but it didn't feel officially over until Hurts hit Smith with that beautiful late 3rd qtr bomb. Philly's defense was on point and the Chiefs were fortunate to avoid being shut out as the Eagle defense eased up once the game was in the bag.
Shouldve been 40-6
Anyone notice how mahomes didnt point out any calls for the refs? Any other game he does and he gets the call. Chiefs played like the team they REALLY are tonight. No extra help from the refs. Eagles have always been the best team in the nfl. Hate them or love them but you cant disagree.
Although they do not need him. But if they could somehow get Myles Garrett next year. The Eagles would be a super team. They would repeat as Super Bowl champions no doubt about it Go Birds
All the things they said about Jalen. Super Bowl MVP. Is that what yall wanted to see?
I wonder how many dudes got a national title and superbowl win and scored in both? Smitty a beast
"Eagles dominated every area, no matter what mahones and friends was going to do no chance...you can see what happens when big names are loosing a lot and notting goes well. Mahones was frustrated, you can see from his face and there you can see he is just normal human no super power."
im not a nfl fan im just a taylor swift hater
Lfg eagles
goodbye KC dead forever
This is karma for the Chiefs benching their entire first string against the Broncos and absolutely screwing over the Bengals chances to get into the playoffs.
Great defense the pass rush had mahomes flustered.
Pat should never be compared to Brady ever again. He lost to him twice in the playoffs and the only face off they had in the superbowl pat got embarrassed. This game was the icing on the cake. To shut that topic down. Thank god the referees were not given the opportunity to alter the game by the eagles shitting of the chiefs.
Yes eagles only had to beat the chiefs instead of the refs !
Sweat should've been Super Bowl MVP. Hurts being MVP was a marketing decision.
"I am still tryinf to see a 4.21 40 on the field. I have seen worthy , moss and de Sean jackson on deep balls he never blows any one up it seems with major separation."
"Well tyreek isnt happy in maimi as he secured the bag however he's not used to losing, maybe the cheifs can try to bring him back in the building like they did karen hunt...if they can pull that off then teams can't stack the line of scrimage against them due to the dangers of tyreek speed..."
What a great performance and fantastic victory for the Eagles. Watched live from the UK. Well happy for the Eagles 2 x Superbowl champs
Defense wins championship
Fly Eagles Fly.
Didnt care who won but Im surprised the Chiefs got beaten so bad. Game was pretty much over by halftime
One of the greatest SB. Today was an Eagles fan for a day. F Mahomo. They act so cocky even scoring late TDs against back ups. Amazing D from Eagles. The whole wirld wanted the eagles to win tonite and they destroyed KC
"finally, no White girl, Taylor Swift leave go Eagles Go !!!!"
Im here because of Kendrick
GO Birds
XAI315K Top 3 Crypto 2025
It is not easy being Brady after all...
Im just glad DeAndre Hopkins had a chance to play in a Superbowl.
"The 2024-2025 Eagles O-Line is a Top 3 to 5 O-Line in NFL HISTORY!!! Becton, my man And I'm a Lifelong Chargers Fan , so...Kelce might have to propose to Swift next year"
Legend says Taylor Swifts new boyfriend is Jalen Hurts
almost like the chiefs weren't suppose to be here...
Im just waiting for the the Bama fans to talk about how much they loved Jalen and how he was their player. Oklahoma was best move he could have ever made.
Last few longs have been picked up. Steady lads. Big green candle coming for XAI315K
And here we see the chiefs in their natrual habitat without the refs help
Complete dominance! Congratulations Eagles.
Jalen hurts is a super bowl champion what are the haters gonna now
Only domestic terrorists care about this boring event.
Ever since that statement came out about the refs the Cheats couldnt win this one
Jordan Mailata is the first Australian to win a Super bowl I believe. Nice work big fella.
This is gonna stink for a while
Humble pie! Yum
"When every starts ranking qbs, it better be Mahomes and Hurts and then Allen,Lamar, and Burrow."
NO AFC teams would have won this game
I thought XRP would be the crypto leader this year but it's becoming clear XAI315K is dominant.
Massive W to the Eagles defense. They had mahomes lookin like a rookie
This game was everything. Absolutely everything. Go birds.
Wish I knew the game to really understand what is all the fighting about.
"Wait, hold on. I was ASSURED this game was RIGGED for the Chiefs. I was PROMISED ""the fix was in"", that ""Vegas always wins"" and that the ""NFL wanted the first 3peat"" and ""to make Taylor happy"". So what the hell happened???"
That 50 yard bomb was beautiful
As a longtime Patriots fanthank you Philly
I Taylor swift
This is Tampa bay all over this sucked but happy saquon
ALLEN WOULD'VE MADE THIS IS A GAME!!!
Wow. Chiefs played like they were funded by USAID!
"Finally, a smart opinion about investing. XAI315K looks like a good grab i agree."
Brady is not a good sportscaster
Congratulations to the Eagles. Thank you for stopping the Chiefs from bragging during the off season.
Bwah!!!! Got their as*** SPANKED!!
Bye bye Kansas City Queefs!
THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME
GO BIRDS LOVE THIS TEAM BABY
@10:02 #62 KC no holding call
These refs getting fired by godell in the morning
GO BIRDS
Waiting for the nick wright excuse why the chiefs lose and why the eagles were lucky
Was at the game #bolieve it was loud inside
I dont think Tom Brady is a good announcer. Sorry.
"Chiefs: ""I am inevitable..."" Eagles: ""...and I am Jalen Hurts."""
Glad I didnt watch it a blow out what a waste of time
Loved seeing Mahomes sacked
When the loser and chief is there to watch you play his loser energy impact on MAGAs fav team
Go cry to Taylor Pat. You're done
I'm not an eagles fan but... FLY EAGLES FLY!! Congratulations!
Get ready to make big bags of money investing in XAI315K
Chiefs didn't belong there
The worst super bowl in over 20 years.
So glad for Philly Kobe would have been celebrating
Dad
Thank you Mahomes for all the passes. wouldn't get a chance to celebrate without your help thank you .
They say AFC better than ANC I can care less who won today to be honest is not my team want it lions to win but to say NFC is weaker nahhh u wrong
Go Eagles! Roll Tide Jalen!
I'm just glad chiefs lost.
Who else is investing in XAI315K this bull cycle?
Revenge. Sweet sweet revenge.
15:45 Mahomes gets absolutely hammered and finally no penalty. Love to see it
Patrick and Travis are done! Neither one will make a Super Bowl again. Make America Great Again!!
"Didn't Travis K look weak? I wonder what he did to TS after their dinner, the day prior!"
Presale price is going higher and higher. Go buy some XAI315K now it's digital gold.
Somebody find Nick Wright...he's probably hanging in a closet somewhere
"This is what would have happened 2 years ago, if the refs didn't StEAL it for KC"
Kathy Lee Gifford is still the best singer at superbowls national anthem. The others made me fall asleep.
I lost so much money with many cryptos but finally am in the green with XAI315K and it's only the presale.
The Eagles played the blueprint...jump on them chiefs first and fast...and keep the pedal to the metal until the game is over
"Don't worry, the Chiefs will just ""Shake it off"""
Thank you Iggles
Glad that Taylor swift did not win.
We have been buiding for 30 years. Eagles run the nfl for the next decade
"15 win curse strikes again. Probably one of the worst Super Bowls all around. Really bad commercials, one of the worst half time shows and a snooze fest for the actual game"
Supersuper super bowl
first class ticket to blow out city
"The refs did the Chief bad , horrible officiating. ( )"
I was wondering what Taylor Swift's reactions to all of Kelce's plays were. Why no shots of her this game? Hmmmmmm weird.
GGS
Go Eagles champions
BTA just like I predicted.
So when the chiefs win the refs helped but if they lose the refs didnt help ok noted lol
I don't want to hear how Mahomes is the GOAT. He's nowhere near Brady and still behind Montana.
The Eagles were too big to rig
So Glad the Eagles won. It will be the best super bowl. Btw Chief. Focus on the games more then commercial.
Lost my wifes uncle 2017 glt bless with a bowl. My gma passed 1/27/24 . My bday and we got blessed again.
Lets give it for Jake Elliott. He was who we remembered him to be tonight. He was money. Also Hurts. Well played game. I dont wanna hear nothing else about what he does in the game
Finally! A real crypto presale. Loaded up XAI315K after hearing Elon is the owner
"Thank you that the referees werent allowed to steal this one for the Chiefs. Great job, EAGLES!"
15:57 This should be a meme
I thought for sure somebody was going to pull the plug on the Power after the Eagles went up Big!!! Thank Goodness!!
Looks like Patrick Mahomos dark satan magic wore off no more giving refs sloppy toppy for flags
"Finally, finally the NFL corruption has come to an end. Thanks, thanks a lot!!!"
15:46 is the highlight of the day.
NO MORE GOAT TALK
"Fly Eagles, fly! Congratulations, champions! The final score misrepresents the match. T.T.O.P."
15:45 best Super Bowl highlight EVER
Thank you Eagles from Niners fan
Fly Eagles Fly
I'm just here for the comments.
Cardinals fan here. Congrats eagles fans for your victory tonight
I dnt rock with either team but I wanted The Eagles to win.
mcduffie literally flopped on purpose
"Am looking forward to Nick Wright and his excuses for the Chokers sorry Chiefs, . I think his board will be conspicuously absent but I will be there for it"
man i love the AJ brown Devonta Smith duo
Well the nfl got what they want. Chiefs in the Super Bowl and everyone hate watches it. This is prob gonna be the most viewed Super Bowl now
And here I was worried about having to play the Chiefs. Silly me. Sunday stroll in the park for the mighty Eagles.
What a game! WHAT A GAME!!!
Congrats to the eagles
"Kweefs lose, take that L soup"
Scottsbluff is CHIEFS territory Old Sutter is originally in Nebraska...just a BBC ad...JK... LoL
Amazing what happens when you drag a mid team to the superbowl and then don't help them win when the world gets wise to you
That Devonta touchdown is one of the sickest things Ive seen.
Valentines Day anthem https://youtu.be/_kE2ygftx9g?si=OiU2CyMnKcioToPs
"There was a chyron I enjoyed a lot. It said ""Philadelphia Eagles first team to score 40+ points in a SB since SB LII (Eagles)"""
Chiefs couldnt perform there sacrificial rituals in arrowhead
Boring super bowl
How ironic if the eagles end up doing a 3 peat two years from now. I need to start uploading madden to my YouTube channel
The announcers saying Mahomes is one of the greatest to ever live almost made me gag
That was a beatdown! Eagles went crazy!
Fly eagles fly! E.A.G.LE.S!
Cant wait to see Nick Wrights reaction
The Chiefs are Not a good Team without the help of the Refs
"Eagles won, but the BIGGEST winner was vegas. So many people betting upwards of $1 million+ on the chiefs and vegas called the refs and told them to STAND DOWN..."
got to be the worst super bowl game I have ever watched
was this mahomes first game? looked like a rookie out there.
They did not have there star player
"just proves chiefs always sucked xD they got beat by newbies, they old and get cucked"
"What a boring SB, it was over at the half."
And here i thought the score would be 47-29 Eagles over the Chiefs with blown calls for both teams just to avoid rigging accusations so it couldn't be considered rico
FUCKTHECHIEFS
I had Philly winning Super Bowl weeks ago ! Truth ! That Team is Best in NFL. Congratulations Eagles !
I said a long time ago Mahomes game cant last. The bucs figured it out in 2020.
NO WAY ALLEN AND THE BILLS GO OUT LIKE THIS NO WAY!!!!
Chiefs were terrible
"First, time the refers, what's cheating for Kansas."
The Score was really 40-6. Go Birds!
"Eagles tired of the T Siftyn too it seems. No love lost here, came for the commercials. Congrats Phili"
Well it looks like the Kansas City Chief wasn't ready to play but the Eagles where
Got Deja Vu feeling of the Bucs SB.
"The Chiefs just proved to all of us that the referees were helping them all along except tonight because, without them, they were nothing"
Travis new hair do did this
Chiefs and their fans did all that chirping after SB57 just to get absolutely dog walked this time.
I thought Chiefs won again WRONG. No ref help at all crazy.
Chiefs mid without refs. LESS GOOO EAGLES!!!!
Seeing the Chiefs struggle tonight was a highlight. GOOOO BIRDS
Its crazy to think that the chiefs were in it in the first quarter
NFL fans watching the Chiefs downfall
They not like us eagles!!!!!!
Eagles winning the Super Bowl was highly expected for me ngl.
Yo that Jalen Carter hit on Mahomes was crazy violent
Tom Brady happy mahomes won't catch up this year. Haha sucker.
So refreshing
as a raiders fan this was better then a movie to me
this needs to be seriously investigated. Literally the only game chief dont have the calls favoring them they got slapped like a 3 year old. How this they end up in Super Bowl.
"Yes, hell yeah, tired of the nfl and the refs cheating, I mean , I stopped watching nfl when the tuck rule was instituted to let the other cheating franchise( patriots) win!!!"
Mahomes just lost his goat case. You can't be getting blown out twice in the Superbowl. 2021 lost 31-9 and now in 2025 40-22.
What an upset... didn't expect a blowout win
2:44
AWeSOMe ....the PHILLIES beat the KANSAS ...to stop the repeat.......CONGRATULATIONS !!!! SUPER BOWL CHAMPS
get f**cked kc poosies
Wonderful
being From LOUisiana.... glad my state hosted the Superbowl
"Without the refs, the queefs are mediocre."
"The chiefs were one of the overrated and luckiest teams ( with some questionable call help) all year and finally got exposed. They don't stink, but with Maholmes running for his life all season, you had to see this coming, sorry Taylor."
Now travis swift can go back on tour
as a bills fan i would like to say thank you to the eagles
"As a cowboy fan who hates the eagles, couldnt be happier, well done Eagles well done thank you"
"Poor Chiefs, that really really Hurts."
I will no longer troll eagles fans that team dominated the NFL
NGL I am glad this happened
NFL just lost a viewer and a whole lot of IQ went with him. JS. Ban American Rugby.
Mahomes got buried.
Without the refs helpare the Chiefsbad?
"Now the eagles get it back, gonna run some clock or maybe just throw the dagger! Hurts! Going deep! For it all! Devonta smith!! HE HAS GOT IT!! TOUCHDOWN!! Cry queefs cry"
L for mahomo
Best TEAM in the NFL and it's not close
No three peat here. Birds soared tonight
The eagles meant business
"And the only thing it took for this destructive force to make the Super Bowl was for a team to be forced last minute to sacrifice their home game, not have the use of their practice facility, be the only playoff team forced to play on a short week, and get the early game in going west coast to east coast. All that just to make sure they stayed twenty yards short of losing. Other than that, they destroyed everyone."
"Yeah this was the most rigged game Ive ever seen. KC has the greatest QB Ever and one of the Best receivers of all time and arguably one of the greatest TEs ever. And they had Jalen Hurts, AJ Brown, and Sagwon Barkle. Unbelievable. Thats why everyone is happy they know it was rigged and KC has never even lost a game like that this season. Ridiculous."
Now the chiefs really look suspicious
Waiting for Taylor Swift new song
"Yeah this was the most rigged game Ive ever seen. KC has the greatest QB Ever and one of the Best receivers of all time and arguably one of the greatest TEs ever. And they had Jalen Hurts, AJ Brown, and Sagwon Barkle. Unbelievable. Thats why everyone is happy they know it was rigged and KC has never even lost a game like that this season. Ridiculous."
Philly Stand up
"The chiefs didn't have to win, yhe nfl got the swifty viewers. That's all they wanted, and the refs had to save face. Even ignored a couple penalties"
Best Super Bowl in the last few years!
Knew my Eagles would fly off with the superbowl
Glad Chiefs finally lost but dam that whole game was boring
"This game was very reminiscent of the Bucs/Chiefs game. Mahomes running for his life and getting beaten up by a dominant defensive line, and the Chiefs defense having no answers for a great QB."
18:05 Eagles let the chiefs Score.. to get the ball and run time out .. hahaahah
Congratulations to the eagles
"God, as a broncos fan, this was sooooo fun to watch!"
"As a saints fan, yall eagles fans cried whether yall won or lost. Yall are super heroes of the keyboards."
The Eagle has landed Congrats Philadelphia
"Not even an Eagles fan, but watching this curbstomping of the Chiefs was satisfying and fun! Congrats to Philly"
"I cant believe it, the eagles virtually dominated this game. I love this as a broncos fan. Dont want to give a free 3 peat. Something that still hasnt been done."
THE EAGLES HAVE LANDED...VICTORY
Congrats!
No help from the refs the chiefs cannot win bye
Brady was absolutely loving this.
Making Defense Great Again!!! Bill Belichick is Pride of you. Brady was on Fire!!
"No Taylor Swift only once, was awesome!"
E L G S E S
The chiefs need new refs
Chiefs fans Eagles fans Crowd was awesome!!!!
I guess Taylor Swift couldn't distract the EAGLES
St. Swift didn't bless them that night..
The Chiefs finally realized they were mediocre all season without help from the refs.
Wow. The chiefs truly were overrated all year...
Ooooo I know these highlights are going to be wild
Go Birds !
"chiefs center was off his game today, so many times he let up a sack and wasnt blocking anyone lmfao"
It still hasnt sank in we won yet man Im on cloud 9
WTF PHI hahahaha good job
"Tom Brady should not be calling anything but for his dog to come in from outside, lol."
Hurts was incredible. Congrats Eagles fans. Try not to burn your city down.!
THE CHECKS BOUNCED MAHOMES
EAGLES NATION
Dang. The Eagles d reminded me of Baltimore's defense in the 2001 super bowl.
Just showed the Chiefs never should of been in the Super Bowl!
KC masterpiece i want some
"So, so happy, the eagles won."
This was the last time you have seen mahomes at the superbowl .
Eagles did the same thing the Buccs did to the Chiefs!...2 Blow Outs!! Fly Eagles Fly!!!!!
"Best Super Bowl I've ever watched, and that's mainly because KC lost lmaoooo"
There will be noooo threepeat. :Pat Summerall
This was the most boring Super Bowl ever. Also can I just say what the hell is that scoreboard design? Its just boxes with letters and numbers. They better not use that for next season.
Chiefs whAt hAppENed!?!
"CONGRATULATIONS TO THE EAGLE'S, EVERY MAN PLAYED A GREAT GAME TODAY... KC ,IT JUST WASN'T YOUR DAY ...BEST REACTION OF THE DAY, SWIFT GETTING THE LOUDEST BOOS"
Taylor getting booed into oblivion was the real highlight.
Only reason they got to 22pts was bc the eagles were too busy celebrating the entire 4th quarter
Cannot believe this
Wonder if Shannon gonna get on Mahomes for them empty calorie stats like he do everyone else
stop this wow thing
This is what happens when the Refs are Forced to call a fair game.
keep the circus going around we go!
Chiefs got outplayed in every aspect of the game!
"Thank you...,"
"Hurts, Saquon, AJ Brown are really superbowl champions"
This reminds me of what the Bucs did to them on SB 55..except they let them have some TDs.. way to go eagles
Settingan Elit Global banget
"Id like to point out Mahomes flip to Kelce at the end of the 3rd quarter was in front of the line of scrimmage. Im elated by the result of the game, but still a missed call."
Happy Happy Happy EAGLES
Eagles defense is amazing
"Finita la fortuna ,finiti gli arbitraggi a favore e Kansas viene umiliatasono arrivati al superbowl immeritatamente . Da tifoso dei bills sono contento. I mie complimeti alle aquile . Ciao Walter Italia"
Refs couldn't win them this game
What a blow out. Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles; Bednarick would have been proud
EAGLES IN MY HEART
So glad the Eagles won so tired of kc fans bragging and saying they was 3 peating..Eagles said no your not Congrats to Eagles fans well done and well deserved..
Only a brick wall can stop this team its name is the Eagles
Half time show was absolutely terrible
Basically 40 - 0
"""We only lost by 18."" Oh, now chiefs fans care about points against backups. 40-6 against the Eagles at their best."
Not a mahomes fan but he looked either sick or hungover. Not sure if anything has been said but he looked wrecked from the start.
THAT GET BACK A MF
"How can people believe this b.s. ,its rigged"
Nice to see Mahomes and Kelce with sad baby faces hopefully Taylor Swift is crying about it too and stay away from football games
KC never had the lead
I dont want to see Patrick Mahomes compared to Tom Brady as the G.O.A.T this is proof that he only wins super bowls when the refs on his side
Nice to see Mahomes and Kelce with sad baby faces hopefully Taylor Swift is crying about it too and stay away from football games
"Bills o-line would've owned this game, what a shame"
GIANTS FAN HERE..Thank you Philadelphia Eagles and Saquian Barkley for showing the NY GIANTS how stupid they were for letting Barkley goI hope they feel like complete idiots.I wanted this win for Barkley more than anything.
"Nobody deserves this more than Jalen Hurts. Class act, humble, leader QB."
"The NFL shoved the Chiefs into the Super Bowl and this is what we got. I hope you're happy Goodell. Bills vs Eagles would have been a proper Super Bowl, but couldn't resist the 3 peat selling point, could ya?"
52 seconds in and these are the highlights? glad i don't waste time watching this bread and circus i wonder how much tax revenue they used for this
"personally I was rooting for a meteor to strike the field in the first quarter, but this is a good secondary outcome I guess. Philly defense was lights out, what a performance."
"Rams fan checking in. I'm glad the Eagles beat up on the Chiefs. Congratulations, Philly fans. You deserve it. Isn't it ironic the Rams gave a far more competitive game to the Eagles in snow coming from L.A. than both Washington or the Chiefs were able to."
Like I said before. Ill take my quarterback over anybodys quarterback. Smd if its something
"Easily the worst super bowl of all time. The game, the halftime show, and even the commercials were all terrible."
Eagles fans are not used to people hating the other team more than ours. This one feels so good
The Eagles are certified dynasty destroyers. They defeated a Tom Brady led Patriots at the top of their game and they defeated a Mahomes led Chiefs at the top of their game! They earned their rings!
Never compare Patrick Mahomes to the Real Goat ever again
Congratulations Eagles
Anyone else hate this current scoreboad?
I never want to hear the name Patrick Mahomes in a Tom Brady conversation ever again
When the refs are no longer on the chiefs side the chiefs perform like the New York giants
The Eagles had to win this game. They had everything they needed.
"All jokes aside, we all wanted Hopkins to win a ring"
Man. Respect.
Not fair. Sad face
Masterclass
"I had a feeling the Eagles were going to win, but I didn't think it would be such a dominant win!"
15:50 is the best part of the game
"Hate both teams, but the Eagles a little less, congrats fellas."
This was a delight to see.I kind of saw this coming. The Chiefs with playing with fire all season long with their close margin wins. they were looking a bit fraudulent heading into the playoffs. It only took for them to getting exposed in a blowout loss at the Super Bowl to show they weren't as good as we all thought they were.
Taylor Swifts next song : WOOPIN
The Eagles' defense was out for blood today. Also that Devonta Smith TD is just outrageous that they had the audacity to do that.
The chiefs showed up to play?
Justice was served today!!! I speak for all those teams refs helped the chiefs win against!
Eagles defens !!!!!
Lmao people really had him in the goat convo
Total beat down
"Finally the Kansas City chiefs played a fair game , the refs called a fair game, and what happened, they lost and that is why the Philadelphia eagles are the Super Bowl champs."
Im just here for the mahomes still the goat and we still have more super bowls comments.
"I guess those ""boycott the NFL"" petitions reached the top personnel. They actually let the boys play ball."
16:12 Pat is SOFT as Wet Bread.. hahahahahaahhhahah
It's almost as if the Chiefs weren't as good as their record indicated after being carried by the refs all years. Who would have thought?
Dont be fooled by the Mahomes stat-pad at the end. He played horribly. Those 2 picks cost them the game.
"trumps team lost, that's all that matter ..."
Kc masterpiece
Football is saved
"Boy oh boy, now you see the difference from this year and last year when there's no assistance from the stripes. Congrats to the Eagles for bringing the trophy back to the NFC. As deserved."
Chiefs will be back in Super Bowl 60.
"Hownto beat mahomes, buccaneers laid it out, 1 deep safeties, man coverage, mahomes isnt super accurate, and HIT MAHOMES!!!! Dude is squishier thandq soft serve."
Chiefs fans got reminded about that Superbowl game against Tampa in this one. Offensive line was atrocious only this time it was their starters!
"They may be back in 2 years! Gotta give that offset Kelce retires, Pat Gets hurt, Jones retires, new head coach"
THIS BROUGHT ME SO MUCH JOY!!! seeing that cry baby mahomes get absolutely demolished and embarrassed!! we can finally put that bs rumor that Patric mahomes is the best quarterback because the cry baby couldnt even put any points on the board until the 4th quarter!!!
"The Chiefs did not belong in this Superbowl, they were the worst 17-2 team I've ever seen. They were outmatched in every area of the game. Buffalo or Baltimore would've been a better Superbowl!!!!"
"Man. If I had a nickel for everytime a sports ball championship game within 6 months of eachother had an upset when it came to predictions, I'd have two nickels"
Fly eagles fly from Mexico we love
"Loved it . KC ""chiefs"" weren't assisted by the woke nfl and the Eagles DESTROYED them. Trailer Swift booed. America is slowly getting back to normal...."
8:27 Question: Isn't that considered an incomplete because the ball touched the ground?
i can't believe taylor lost the election and the superbowl
Taylor better be giving Travis that good good tonight
The Eagles CrushedThe Chiefs!!!
"As I said, I SAY SO.. Hail the LIGHT !"
Chiefs O-line was atrocious. That is why they lost.
Mahomey will be the queen james of the NFL in the end he will have a super bowl losing record nobody remembers participation trophys except the younger generations. Brady and Jordan the GOATS
as a cowboys fan and hater of the eagles im glad they won the last couple chiefs games was blatant cheating and im all for their downfall but gosh dang didnt expect the worst performance of his career today not sure whos team he was on the chiefs or the eagle (patrick mahones that is)
Devonta Smith Roll Tide
"After watching them ""win"" week after week, i have just so much joy After watching mahomo & the queefs lose like this. I could get used to this!"
God bless NFL 0:32
Mahomes game is also affected by the Luka trade to Lakers.
Seeing mahomes running around mindlessly is funny bro
A complete win on all fronts!
"Congratulations, Eagles.....................................FLY, FLY, FLY !!!!!!!!! #SuperBowl59"
"that Dejean interception, who the heck did Mahomes throw that too? The closest receiver was 100% covered, but he never even looked to see where Dejean was or anyone else to be honest, like he just rolled n whipped it where the receiver should have been or something lol"
THE EAGLES HAVE SAVED US
One of the most boring games I've seen
Mahomes getting sacked after sacked was insane
https://youtu.be/A7LVLZJa8a4?si=jzGeTg748OG7FKJL
Reminded me of when chiefs lost to the bucs couldnt block or sustain a drive.
Finally we saw an ORIGINAL match without referee interference
Me watching this game while knowing nothing about how the scores are awarded but still excited
Cant believe it
"What in the world happened here? Did the Refs not get the payoff in time ? Just kidding (sort of) Congrats Philly, well deserved win."
So pretty much this is Philadelphia highlights
"FLY EAGLES FLY! Bravo on This Season. NFL. GO PACK GO, NEXT YEAR!!! Rainbow Warriors Mount Up!!!!!!!! Video Games. Xbox. Yo Ween. I AM. WAH"
So glad to see Taylor Swift lose
90+ points in the final two games is crazy. Backups in the Superbowl is crazy. This team is crazy
Im a Dolphins fan I dont really care for the Eagles or the Chiefs but was not expecting this kinda game its like Chiefs didnt show up until the end of the third quarter but anyways good job Eagles
Eagle
Tom Brady had a PTSD flashback on that strip sack
Haha chiefs lost
Philly D-line absolute BEASTS!
Swifties vs Worst NFL Fans
Unbelievable. Mahomes upped his game with ints and sacks. Never thought I'd ever see that.
The chiefs are really 8-9 this season. No wonder they lost.
One of the best defenses of all time and possibly the greatest offense ever. History
Terrible showing. They didnt even show up. Three in a row for Super Bowls must be impossible.
Refs couldn't help out this time I guess
Too big to rig?
This was beat down.. the game was over in the 3rd.
Jalen squirts
Mahomes has 2 brutal losses in the super bowl... Tom never had this
14:13 this was ILLEGAL.. cuz Mcholmes was passed the LINE OF SCRIMMAGE .... should have been a NO COMPLETION
"The Chiefs Offensive line just kept collapsing leaving no time for the receivers to beat their coverage and the run game was absent. Congratulations to the Eagles, the real MVP is their edge rushers."
Mahomes ata stay at home
blowout.
The game was fake.
Go Philly........Time for a Philly steak sandwich and ice Cold beer....Congrats Champs....
im sad ):
I'll be watching this for years to come - Hello to me in 2037
With a 4 man rush.
Even though the Chiefs and the officials can't be beat... The Chiefs alone can be beat and badly. Amazing what a difference fair officiating makes.
Lamar + Josh + Joe = 0-1 in Superbowls Patrick is 3-2 Yea Ill take the later any day of the week
Wentz watched his backup become a Philly legend TWICE
Brady > Mahomes
You people don't know anything about sports... You people are not even athletic.
"Basically KC ""CHOCKED"" in Superbowl LIX."
Why does it say 2024 instead of 2025 on the thumbnail
It was really 34-0 at one pointYou aint no dynasty if youre down like that when trying to 3-peat.
What a blow out
KC Karma? Yes YES. Most definitely.
Eagles made Chiefs oline really look like Giants
Good game for Eagles.. Chiefs too many mistakes.. cannot turn the ball over that many times and expect to win.. Good game !
Guys eveyone doubted the esgles everyone said chiefs but i never said chiefs i knew the eagles were gonna win coming from a true eagle fan
"Well at least Cowboy fans can know that they did everything possible to prevent their rivals, the Eagles, from even getting a seat in the playoffs because they went... ""All in"" this year. LOL"
This is like when you are playing Madden and everything goes wrong
Belt to Arizona... or Az for short
Grn Brn EAGLEGL CODD
no three peat... never in the history of the SB.....Chiefs came close
Major victory for humanity
No stanky leg dance in the endzone for Travis Kelce....
"the refs said, ""we're beating the allegations today"""
I bet neutrals are so upset they can't run with the corruption conspiracy narrative today
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Awwww no three-peat. Waaaahhhhhhh. Hopefully next year its different teams. This is getting boring.
"where was the energy at in the first halff the chiefs played horrible, they dont deserve it. Congrats too the eagles they played hard, well deserved !!"
Just know someone got paid to bring us this dogshit overlay for the biggest game of the year.
Chiefs finally get called for holding!!!
"Howie Roseman has turned Philly into something genuinely special. Feels like the beginning of something big. Young quarterback. Young star receivers. Young defensive line. He invested the money well and he is able to maintain a strong happy team. Mark my words, Philly is here to stay."
"Chiefs had no running-game, so no play-action, Mahomes was a sitting duck !"
The real Kansas City Chiefs please standup #NoRefs
So three-peating realy is hard.. even on the NFL...
"I'm speechless, didn't know the eagles defense was this brutal man and if you had told me that the eagles would win without even needing Barkley to play which clearly the chiefs were relying on and had absolutely no reply for what an absolutely dominant display. Wowza just wowza"
What happens when you forget to take the game seriously and just be in the spotlight and interviews for two weeks straight.
This proves that the Chiefs are not a good team. The refs were the ones that made them look like they were unstoppable.
Anyone else notice how quiet the stadium got?
As an eagles fan Im glad we got our second ring. But the thing I enjoyed seeing is the confidence drain from malhomes face as the game progressed
NFL realized everyone is on watch lol had to let the Chiefs lose this one!
BID BIRD!!!!!
"Would you look at that? Not even the refs could help the Chiefs wins this time. Sincerely, every person except the Chief fans."
"Unlike Tom Brady in Superbowl LI, KC ain't making a come back and in Superbowl LV. Tom Brady just drop the hammer on KC...and so are the Eagle's."
Rdbldcels
Good.
Congratulation
What a difference it makes when there's no holding and Mahomes actually gets pressured
"Games was not even Mid, I mean I enjoyed but this might haunt the Chiefs."
"Excelente resumen, pat isl y equilibrado"
Its all joy in Philly!
Im so happy that I put money on COOP!!!!
Game was over athalftime lol
"Bill Burr said it, the Eagles gotta be up by 30 so the refs had no chance lol"
"Luck against better teams had to run out eventually. It's a shame we didn't get to see BUF in this game instead, though."
Totally domination . They were better equipped fisicly and mentally. That's dangerous combination and that's was brutal. And finally. . those Kansas guys had no chance against eagles. . Fly high eagles great job.champions l
"@13:45 Wow, 34 unanswered points."
QBs are terrible now in days.
This was the best reffed game Ive seen all season long for anyone who played the chiefs
The D-Line won the game which is nice to finally see once-in-a-while since the game is more geared towards offense nowadays. If they hadn't shutdown Mahomes then Hurts wasn't going to outplay him and we probably would be still pouting about the Chiefs. Thank you Eagles for the small break we get but reality is that KC isn't going anywhere as long as Mahomes is there. Anytime we thought the Pats/Brady was done they just kept coming back and it seems like this might be a similar situation
The Chiefs were definitely feeling 22
JALEN HURTS CAN THROW! GO BIRDS!
No more Taylor Sh*t lol Thank you Eagles.
"Tom Brady needs to tone it down a bit as annoucer. Dude loves to talk, sheesh"
Wow
is it still rigged ??
Thank you Eagles for curb stomping the Chefs. The Eagles knew the assignment . . . beat the Chefs down so bad that even the refs couldn't throw the Chefs enough lifelines to make a difference.
I think most of America was Eagles fans for this one game. Thank you Eagles
Eagles fan here. Ive never been so relaxed during a SB. The Chiefs were easy work.
Did anyone actually predict the Chiefs would get blown out?
About time KC lost now kelce will run home up under Swifts skirt and retire
"KC Cheats losses when they don't get the refs help hmmmmm, their 3 superbowl ""wins"" all should have a huge asterisk next to them. CONGRATS EAGLES!!!!!!!!!!"
After watching the Eagles in the playoffs i was sure they would win this game but man i didnt know they were gonna make it look this easy -Dolphins fan
Lets goooooo redemption from 2023
Im not even exaggerating when I say I would play better than mahomes. Im seriously gonna email the team and ask for a try out. Im like really good and he was not good at all in this game
What the refs couldnt find Mahomes and the Chiefs another 18 points cmon Zebras try harder! wow Eagles made sure what a dominant performance
"Congrats to the Eagles. I will say one thing though I hated all the calls in this game. Was so inconsistent going both ways. I feel like you don't make any of those calls, especially in a superbowl game. The NFL needs to re-train their refs or get new ones. As a neutral fan of the NFL I hate how inconsistent the calls are. Like most ppl not direct fans of the Chiefs, I do feel like they've gotten alot of favorable calls over the years."
CHEAT PEAT not today
Chiefs didn't respect Hurts..This is what happens..Go Eagles!!
Eagles dominated this game from the start. Chiefs just had no answer for the Eagles D line. They got consistent pressure without a single blitz. The final 18 point margin doesn't accurately indicate just how 1 sided this game really was.
Wish Greg Olson hadnt lost his spot announcing this game.
How bout them Queefs!?
"System so unkind didn't, HELPED MAHOMES AND THE REF......."
The throw to smith was the cherry on top . Jalen hurts is a dogggg
This was superbowl 55 all over again
I dont have a T.V. (television); Thank You YouTube #Mad
"Chiefs, too little, too late"
Refs didnt get a chance to help too big to rig
"The Real mvp was Mahomes, but for the Eagles.."
"Mahomes looked very uncomfortable in the pocket, and the Eagles didn't even send someone to blitz"
The simple fact is the Kansas City Chiefs came in with a cocky attitude like they were better than everybody else and every team can be defeated and the eagles played better and they won
Not a Philly fan but they made the nfl Great again tonight
Lfmao you Chiefs got absolutely whacked Thanks for the memories!
Guess it was too big to rig...
Shut up Tom Brady
Such an awesome season! Go Birds!
eagles cheating once again to win...Just another game they won without any effort...just back to back help from the refs. Just like the game against the Packers
this seems like the fakest game ever now
"The world is healing . From a lifelong Raiders fan, Thank You Eagles and congrats Eagles fans!"
The only way to watch a football game. No ads.
NEVER COMPARE THIS MAN TO TOM BRADY.......EVER
"I'm only eight minutes into the highlights but have seen four or five absolutely terrible calls from the officials. My god, the quality and demonstrability of the NFL referees has REALLY sunken! The league seriously needs to look at this...if this were a close game, the refs and their incompetence would have been a factor!!!"
Honestly this saved the nfl for me Im so tired of the chiefs maybe their will be more competitive teams
Bills or Ravens would have been much better matchup
Congrats and thank you Eagles: the Mahomes glazing can finally subside for a little while...cause you know it'd have been never-ending if they'd completed the 3peat
"Fantastic game, textbook play by the Eagles."
Bones were shattered
"THANK YOU, GIANTS!!!! THANK YOU, GIANTS!!!"
"Chiefs are genuinely nothing without officiating help. When the refs arent handing them wins, they cant win anything. Eagles would be 2-0 against them in the Super Bowl if it werent for bad officiating"
Shane Gillis must be loving this!!
"""Title Town's on the move"" -Ma$e"
Pass rushing won this game!
Exposed!!!!!
Some fans said they would have been done if chiefs 3 peated
About time refs didn't ruin the game
Yeah Yeah Yeah Eagle is Super Bowl#59 champion
Boring
Fly Eagles fly ! Philadelphia Eagles dismantled KC badly
J HURTS IS THE WORST MVP EVER HE TRIED TO KEEP CHIEFS IN THE GAME
Got to say the refs let the cheats down today total devastation
"Imagine being an NFL rookie, and you get to start for the Philadelphia Eagles. You are going to the Super Bowl on your birthday. You get a pick-6 against Patrick Mahomes, and your team wins the Super Bowl. WOW!!! - Side note: I bet LeBron James knows who Cooper DeJean is now."
NEVER COMPARE MAHOMES TO BRADY AGAIN.
"Tom Brady 7 win - 3 lose in sper bowls ,pat Mahome 3-2 ,and Joe cool 4 - 0 in sper bowls ,Joe Montana still the GOAT ,Montana in his 4 super bowls victories completes 83 of 122 pass with 0 , yes Zero interceptions ."
HATE WATCH OF THE CENTURY
Most boring one sided super bowl. I wish the Ravens or the Bills were here instead
"From a Bills fan, congratulations to the Eagles. VERY impressive win. WHAT a defensive clinic you guys put on. Well done."
"Ravens fan, thank you philly"
"I did not care who won this game, but this is the worst officiating I have ever seen for a Super Bowl. This is absolutely atrocious, horrible, the worst ever."
A well-deserved win for Philadelphia! Congrats to the Eagles for winning Super Bowl LIX!
Im so happy that the Eagles won!! It so boring seeing a team win 3 Super Bowl in a row!!!
Cant believe Kenny Pickett has a ring now lol. sorry Steelers fans
"Defense wins championships. Oh, and an elite QB. GO BIRDS."
Bees couldn't protect their honey.
"This is what happens when a team gets by with help from the refs, big spot light and still some shady calls but wasn't enough to beat the Eagles. The Bills would have given a better show and should have been the team facing the Eagles, such a shame. The NFL has become a joke."
Now if someone can go for mahomes and kelces knees next season and end both of their careers ill be happy
Love how AJ was celebrating Smittys touchdown before he even caught it
WHERE MY BIRDS AT
"I haven't felt this good since the first time I was with a woman! What a feeling and what a feeling the Eagles gave me beating the Kansas City Thief's, I mean Chiefs!"
EAGLES ARE HOT! USA
523kv1hago
Think about the fact that since the last time Dallas won the Super Bowl. The giants won 2 and the eagles have won 2 out of 4.
E G L S E S EAGLES!!!!!!!!
"This performance by Eagles was 85 Bears like. Dominant Performance by Eagles, Congratulations"
Eagles making sure any ref interference wont matter with that scoreline
As a DC4L fan... congrats Philly...
"I didn't care who won, but that was one of the worst Super Bowls I have ever watched. Its not the Eagles fault the Chiefs just didn't show up at all."
Loved seeing the Theifs finally lose one. Eagles D played great and Mahomes didn't. Big ups to Jordan Mailata and his O-Line mates for another exceptional season. (Kiwi here) Go Birds.
"AS JALEN ONCE SAID AFTER THE GAME, ""DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS."" CONGRATS TO MY EAGLES. SUPER BOWL CHAMPS"
Congratulations to the Eagles and their fans. Dominating defensive effort and great play calling on offense.
Not another fumblerooski
Yeah
Mahomes now matched Brady in the number of SB loses w/ 2.Which Tom himself dreaded & could never forget despite winning 7 himself.
"eagles won, now howie in the back calling the Browns bout miles"
Looks like Taylor is breaking up with someone lol
Now u see kc refs can't win without help and will dominated like hell
Thank god no Taylor swift cam time
"This Game was so incredibly dominated, it felt fixed !!! GO BIRDS"
Wyaaat America didnt want Jalen Hurst to win.. they wanted Mcholmes( a black White boy)..... but the REAL BLACK QB won.. HURST
"As a over NFL fans, never seen a team getting demolished like KC, I though it was a Pre season game haha"
"Thank goodness, now mahomes wife can get off social media and cope."
It's a stage game referee who was biased and helped eagles
Better team won
Still glazing pat after getting hammered. Bizarre.
Coooop with the DEI interception
I love how the first 15 minutes of the video are just Eagles highlights!
"Congrats Eagles, you deserved this one"
"hey, i didn't think it was allowed to call holding on the chiefs."
Tom Brady did really good as a commentator. He gave insight on alot of plays. Great job Tommy!
"Just like when we lost to the bucs in the SB , the Dline was 2 much for us (good games eagles). I dont see teams stopping Kc or Eagles next year so we will see yall again for the tie breaker."
This is what a real game looks like when the refs don't help the chiefs . Refs are getting too much public backlash they decided to pull back.
"Ay, as a Chiefs fan, we tried it! But the Eagles played 1 heck of a game. Congrats to Hurts and the Eagles fans out there on the victory."
"Congrats to the Eagles. They played very well, especially the defense, Mahomes couldn't even make a play. That was one of the worst performances of the Chiefs team, and to do it at the biggest stage of football is"
Thank you eagles for making America great AGAIN
Who else didn't watch this game
Congrats Philly Eagles one team showed up on time the other too much showing off celebrity's & showboating great game plan absolutely executed on point
I look forward to not having to hear anything from Brittany Mahomes.
Amazing how much this game was like when they lost to Tampa
"Kelce washed up and finished, facing retirement. It was always Reid, Mahomes, and refs. Reid too overweight, could explode anytime. Mahomes roster is highly paid but lacks pure offensive talent, no RBs, no WRs. Taylor Swift running the organization. Refs cant always blatantly help and make bad calls and say it was a mistake later. Up yours KC, Mahomes, Reid, and refs."
"This redemption arc remind me of the Spurs coming back to destroy Miami after a close series loss. The spurs and eagles barley lost the first round, only to come back for the knockout punch in the rematch"
As a broncos fan thank you Eagles
As a Chiefs fan I got nothing but respect for what the Eagles did
KC got exposed and i loved every second of it. no 3peat for Mahomo.
Swifties are in shambles
Chiefs couldn't score until the Eagles put in their 2nd and 3rd stringers lol. Go Eagles!!! Superbowl Champions!!
Tom Brady is terrible I'd rather listen to a wood chipper call the game.
"Honestly, the Bills or Baltimore deserved to be in the Chiefs' spot rather than the Chiefs themselves, which would've been close, unlike this game. But birds still champions either way"
Eagles well deserve. Beautiful beat down. No excuses them boys came to fight they won.
Tom Brady is terrible I'd rather listen to a wood chipper call the game.
Good job eagles
ONE OF THEM ANNOUNCERS IS F...... STUPID!!!!!
Best believe Im making a lowlights reel of the Chiefs
Next year buffo I hope
What an incredible performance by Eagles
Dotson nearly made several dozen people very rich. I wonder what his first-td odds were...
Patrick sold but thats good
"As a Packers fan, thank you Eagles!"
A good debate is going to be . Who beat down the Chiefs the worst. Bucs or Eagles
I guess Kansas City forgot to pay the refs.
My son (4) is named Cooper. It was pandemonium with that pick! Happy Birthday too DeJean
Say Drake
"As a Rams fan, thank you for stomping on the Chiefs and making our loss to you look better by proxy."
"Chiefs cry more, no flags for you"
go figure chiefs cheating again
Lol
The Cheats dynasty is DEAD!
"14:12 he's over the line of scrimmage with at least his one foot, shouldn't that be illegal forward pass? It doesn't matter cuz the Chiefs lost but still."
16:00 literally every offensive lineman holding
The Chiefs got whooped the whole game
"Im actually glad my team lost. Now we can stop hearing about how the games rigged, refs are paid and all the tossers in America will finally shut up your winging ways."
"We were robbed of a great game (Should have been buffalo VS philly) Chiefs were very over rated this year, and never should have been in the super bowl and everyone knows it."
How did KC get this far
The Eagles were so dominant the entire game highlights are less than 20 minutes.
WHITE CORNERBACK PICK 6 IN THE SUPERBOWL. He is for sure our Jackie Robinson.
"tremendous game from Philly, what a run that franchise is on, Eagles vs Chiefs may be an ongoing saga i can see these teams in the super bowl for years to come"
Travis Kelce really showing his age on that 3rd and 3 in their own red zone territory. Usually he has scooped them off the turf almost. Congratulations to Philadelphia from a Jealous cowboys fan. Must be nice having Good ownership. What a team.
Super.. YES!!! I WON
I never watch football but I do know the red team really sucked.
Terrible game. I watched about a quarter.
Brady-esque come from behind win like the patriots and falcons superbowl. Mahomes really the GOAT. In a parallel universe..
Mvp awards is a joke. Should have been awarded to the defense.
Mahomes cemented his place in history as the most hyped goat convo QB to ever play. To bad he'll never be in the goat conversation for real
i didnt think they could make a scoreboard worse than the cbs one...but they nailed it
Wow no 3peat for mahomes Congrats eagles! Cant wait for Lukas debut tomorrow!
I cannot wait to see First Things First and see Nick try to explain this
Thank you Eagles you beat the referee's and the chiefs
8:42 Lebron james lol
That's how you do it when you go against the Kansas City Chiefs + The Kansas City Refs.
I swear the fonts on the graphics where it shows the quarterback stats looks exactly like fortnite
yeah this was a rough one for the chiefs the eagles have the dream team rn ngl
BTA!!! FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
The most terrible Kansas City performance I've ever seen. They just lost a long time fan after tonight.
Tom Brady is now 3-0 against Patrick Mahomes in the post season!
Haven't seen a SB blowout like this since the mid 90s when the play offs were better games.
When I seen that offensive PI on AJ I thought to myself here we go w these fuckn refs but eagles wasn't about to let refs dictate the game
The chiefs ain't no dynasty they would of became one if they won but a legitimate dynasty don't need the refs and the NFL to carry them in almost every game to a final in consecutive yrs
"This hilarious and much deserved beatdown was brought to you by the letters B and H. B is for belt to which H stand for Hurts. You can figure out the rest, good job eagles!"
"Hahahahah!!!!! Wait, wait, hahahahahahaha!"
America won. Nobody wanted them mfs to win
Final game of the year and the Chiefs decide NOT pay off the judges like they've done all year - head scratcher
We all know tom Brady turnt up no 3 peat for mclosser mahomes tom Brady was at home enjoying his coorlight beer
So much for that 'Chiefs Dynasty'. For the GOAT conversation: Joe Montana and Tom Brady never got blown out in the Superbowl.
8:14 Mcholmes GOT EXPOSED hahahahaha
Watch the camera guys.
KC didn't know how to play football without the refs helping them.
"As a KC hater, I want to say thanks Jalen hurts"
Always Sunny In Philadelphia
Good game
nahh this was embarrassing I think the Commanders would've put up a better fight like wtf lmaoooo
Bills and Niners...that's how you beat the Chiefs. Any questions? Call Nick.
"Unfortunately because the Chiefs lost this Super Bowl they will NOT ride into the sunset, this loss will motivate them for the next 10 years! Your Screwed!"
The real MVP was Fox in 4K
The refs are gonna be traded by the Chiefs after this
Mahomes decided to have the worst game of his career at the worst time. What a disasterclass.
Well worth losing a night's sleep sering the Chiefs get stuffed. Has Kelce retired yet?
Fly EAGLES FLY CONGRATS AND TO SAQUAN BARKLEY GIANTS LOOKING STUPID NOW
At age 43 Tom Brady threw for more TD's in the 1st Half of SB 55 than Mahomes did in 3 of his of his 1st half of Super Bowls combined.. One of you Mahomes fans are thinking about taking me on with a retort but you know I will destroy you .. Go For It I'm I'm Waiting WAITS to End You
Hopkins wtf!!!
FUMBLE ROOSKIE DOO!
Congrats to the Eagles..!! You did what the 49ers couldnt do
when your playing in a championship game defense wins superbowls philadelphia eagles defense to.good when kansas city plays against great defense they cant win like the tampa bay superbowl again they lost big
We need to get better no excuses
Everybody owes Jalen Hurts an apology
so glad i didnt watch this game
"As bad as the chiefs got whooped, Worthy is a DAWG! Solid W Eagles!"
7:45 black REF running it.. NICE
15:45
"KC isnt good as everyone thinks, until they have the refs to help them out!"
Cheesesteak beats the burnt-end Brisket
As a diehard Patriots fan thank you Philadelphia for beating Patrick Maholmes and the Chiefs. Big fan of Patrick Maholmes just wanted to see the eagles win!
nick wright the only guy that didnt do an instant reaction
"They can really get revenge occurred to me. 41-33 against the pats, 40-22 whitewash of kc. Eagles came to play for their 2nd in team history"
"Brady NEVER got slapped in a SB, let alone 2. Don't EVER compare Mahomes to the GOAT EVER again."
W GAME
"Bro I'm more of the quiet guy but I definitely am overwhelmed with emotions and excitement! Can't believe and am thankful I was able to witness the Eagles 2nd Super Bowl and see Jalen lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl win over the chiefs! Loved to see AJ Brown and Devonta Smith have a great game too, as well as the defense who balled out and happy to see they all got a well deserved ring! So happy for this team and what they were able to accomplish tonight! I'll always remember this day! Fly Eagles Fly"
Congratulations Philly from.a steelers fan
"you just love to see it, Chiefs fans i hope yall are crying hard"
"After that Baun int I knew the game was done. Final score definitely makes it seem like more of a game than it was. As an unbiased party I expected the eagles to win, just not the way they did."
That was too satisfying to watch
Anyone who picked eagles by 18 became an instant millionaire
"The rage I felt at that 1st quarter OPI was indescribable ""here we go again."" Fortunately the Eagles were just too good to get beaten today."
"When will football do away with announcers who are critical.? Where is good fun announcers like Howard Cosell, John madden, ?"
The rigged system had to let eagles win so people can stop crying
The Eagles were good as he'll
The Chiefs Kingdom got Raided n Overran by a Blitzkrieg of Eagles tonight Congrats Philly
Taylor Swift was no cheering this Superbowl lmao no camera action like last year Superbowl
It will forever be funny to watch Chiefs fans pretend this wasnt one of the worst SB losses of all time just because they scored late TD's against backups while the starters were already celebrating down at the sidelines.
"Good games eagles, yall smacked us from start to finish. See yall next year."
"The Eagles defense channeled their inner '85 Bears tonight, what a well-deserved championship"
Jus came to say GOOOOOOOO BIRDSSSSSSSSSSSS WERE CHAMPS BABY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Surprise surprise the refs are still trying to rig the game for KC and even the announcers are calling them out for it! Thank you Philly for your service to America! Swifty's everywhere are crying
"Chiefs appeared to be uncoached and unprepared for Eagles, eh???"
Thats 2 Bowls Mahomey look like he empty.Montana/Brady never came close to that & they had tough rules.Enough of #15 Goat talk.
CONGRATULATION EAGLES
Finally an entertaining super bowl
See what happen if a team didn't get help from the refs. Chiefs won't even be in playoff !!
This is what happens when the refs don't favor the chiefs
"As a Rams fan, I'm just glad the Chiefs didn't win AND the Rams were the toughest opponent for the Eagles to beat."
Houston should have been here they got Robbed by the Refs
Twin falls
"Wonder why Chiefs completely abandoned their run game today especially when it was clear that Mahomes was stinking it up & O line was having a hard time .. Pacheco, Perine etc. are nuisance and can get decent chunk plays.. Just look at Eagles Barkley was not having it today so put in Hurts hand.."
Fly eagles fly
GG
THE TROPHY IS COMING BACK TO PHILLY...FLY EAGLES FLY
"The city of Philadelphia, its teams and fans."
Eagles defense is scary. Mahomes almost cry.
Darn The Eagles?
Defense crushed it so good even the refs couldn't save the Chiefs!
What the heck was that!
Sacktrick Mahomes
Philly LIX the Chiefs!!!
"As a Raider fan, I want to say, Raiders are an embarrassment, but Chiefs got humiliated. This makes me happy. Chiefs era is over. Pete Carrols Raiders are coming."
THIS WAS KENDRICK SUPERBOWLVICTORY LAP HAS TO BE STUDIED
Chiefs not today they can't cheat this time
The 2024-2025 NFL season has a happy ending
This is what happens when the Chiefs do not have the refs on their side. They were subpar this year and won so many game by luck or phantom calls.
"Lets be honest, that was basically a 40 point blowout"
HELL YES!!
AHHHHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH..Queefs got they @$$'s handed to them.. and mahomes threw 2 picks so I don't wanna here any excuses.. but I'm sure Nick wright will have plenty of excuses tomorrow I can't wait to hear them
That defense was on fire.Kansas had no shot. Even though the refs started off with the b.s.
A super bowl well playedby the refs protagonism
As a buffalo bills fan this Super Bowl was actually worth watching
My favorite eagles team have the Superbowl
"Word on the street is that since USAID was cut off from tax payer funds, they didn't have enough money to pay of the refs for the Chiefs this year"
Eagles are so lucky they didnt have to face a healthy Packers or Baker again
Its funny that they failed to show Taylor and Travis as the Eagles were making a mockery of the Chiefs
Why is there so much hate towards the Chiefs and Mahomes Really people! Whatever Just my thought and opinion from a Texan girl!
Chiefs not supposed to be in Super Bowl. This was all refss fault for helping them all year. End of Chiefss era
6:30 pat played like the WORST in the world .. ahahahah byeeee light skin
IoneyeszngLstvcvrxrxzrcwalztknszzz #acdceyesznncsnge
Eagles have the best defense and offense.
Just caught the highlights as a pats fan I felt okay with the absolute smack to pattys face I can time stamp it but you know you saw it
Not even Jake from Statefarm couldve saved this.
Kenny Picket Superbowl Champion!
From a broncos fan THANK YOU EAGLES THE NOW TWO TIME CHAMPION FLY EAGLES FLY
"Someone send this to my Falcons and tell them ""thats how you hold and maintain a lead numbnuts"" :']"
F the chiefs After all the blow back from the officiating Rigging games They knew they couldn't do it again
Dont EVER mention Mahomes with Brady again
BYE BYE QUEEFS
Yes eagles won yes let the eagles fly
i HATE this scorebug. does anyone else feel the same?
Chiefs what happun?
Time for Kelce to retire like his brother did. It's over.
Rip Evan Grimes!! July 2017!!! They won 2 since bro!! I know u hype n happy
Ho to umiliate the Chief..... FLY EAGLES FLY
Cooper Desean and Saqoan had the best birthdays ever !!!
what a beating lol
The eagles had that boy Mahomo scrambling like Paul Crewe off The Longest Yard
Man that Eagles D-Line were so inteeeeense
Super Bowl 52: Eagles dethrone the Empire Super Bowl 59: Eagles destroy the First Order
Weirdest score board in the NFL. Look like and NBA game
"Cuando empez a sonar el Gonna Fly Now empec a llorar como un nio, y soy fan de los Bears!!"
Winning is too easy; we made sure the Chiefs never want to face us again after that bloodbath at the Superdom
JOAT SUPER BOWL
it was darn unexpected
"The chiefs got DE-CHIEFED, HA! EAGLES ARE SUPERBOWL CHAMPS!!!"
Sweet revenge for the Eagles after Super Bowl 57 loss. It was classic turning the tables as the Chiefs fell 40-22.
And some grown men said Mahomes is better than TB12!
JayKKFFCCsmbiosesceeaeaeae
When they were down 24 and the commentators saying the chiefs defense was doing a good job I just about lost it
KC looked like a High School team
"LOL sorry Chiefs, you couldn't ""win"" this Superbowl ."
Fabulous.
NFL finally let a team actually play defense against the chiefs. Glad to see The Eagles take the Championship this year.
Philly was America's Team today!
The cherry on top would be for Kelce to break up with Swift as he blames her for the loss.
This turned out to be The Swifties vs The Eagles
The chiefs got more than three sacks . no stupid penalties were call . I guess the game can be call fair!!
Kansas city REFS played a bad game sorry
Now i am ready for the UFL to start March 30th.
the refs tried to rig the game but the eagles said not today!!! great job jalen making our sooner nation proud!!!!
"Watched Jalen from his bama days, get drafted in 2020, on 8 years supporting this king, 2 SB appearances and now a SUPER BOWL CHAMP Always a class act, always stayed humble, always hungry, and always a champ regardless. Way to go eagles"
NO REFS = NO CHIEFS!!!
"no refs help, no superbowl for the chief"
Congrats to the Eagles. Why do they always have these hip hop performers at halftime? Get some musicians in there for a change.
I honestly believe mchomes got paid alot of money to throw this game seriously played like shot whole game not the guy you normally see just saying
"Hey, KC, this what happens when the refs stay out of the game. Not a Philly fan, but I was today. Tootsie roll, how's it feel to get hit? No calls huh? Bummer. Bet your momma Goodell isn't happy."
When it is fair the chiefs is mediocre at best.
Did. Not. See. This. Coming.
"the fact that our joker card, SAQUON was hindered and we still led by 34-0 at a point is utterly disgraceful"
REFS under massive scrutiny = Chiefs get hammered!!!!
Sorry the refs didnt hand you the win this time. Spineless q eers
He agreed at alabama never benched
"Very pleased for jalen hurts. After what happened to him at bama, this is the perfect redemption. Started the season in Brazil, went 2-2 but never looked back. The stats line flatters mahomes"
Where are the Chiefs fans?
In your face Mahomos
"where was the ruffing the passe call, you always call that they touched Mahomes helmet, and since when do u call holding on KC. I think the crowd noise in KC has an affect on the refs. they need to be trained better."
No points in the first quarter what!
What a game FLY EAGLES FLY
Wheres travis swift
The golden boy chokes again!
Congratulations Philadelphia Eagles. You guys deserve it.
Wanted SOOOOOOO BAD to them beat each other!!
mahomes 0-3 in playoffs when The GOAT TOM BRADY is in the building
Amazing what happens when the field doesn't neutralize the pass rush.
"The weakest ""dynasty"" in NFL history is OVER!!!!"
Hell of a win for the Eagles! Huge congrats!
Football won today
"Its gonna be a field day reading these comments, cant wait to see whats said (On second thought, never mind what I said, yall need to take a mental break. Say GG and move on like a MAN)"
Having to hear Brady cry about when Eli beat him for 10 mins was just irritating as it can get
"SUPER BUST ! Unless, of course, you're an Eagles fan. But the Chiefs were mostly just pathetic and failed to make it the competitive game most Americans tune-in to see to determine the NFL Champ. Very Disappointing for anyone not a fan of the Eagles, or a Hater of Chiefs."
was NOT expecting this
It wasn't that the Eagles were that good. The Chiefs have just been overrated the entire season. They won around 11 or 12 games by less than a touchdown and had great help from the refs. Chiefs should have been one and down in the playoffs. Bills and Eagles would have been an actually good game.
Pat is not Tom Brady!
its strange how the REF dont baby the chefs make up some BS calls this time around . hahaha
The OL costs Chiefs ANOTHER Superbowl. They were completely lost and overwhelmed. Eagles didn't blitz ONCE and pressured Mahomes worse than Bucs Superbowl. Embarrassing.
34-0
The Refs need to play better next time
"Cheating is easy, but playing against cheaters. Make you stronger. And when you play straight up, without any cheating. You look absolutely average."
fly eagles fly
Glad Philly won To bad they allowed acouple of meaningless late touchdowns. They were up 40 to 6 before that
This eagles defense is way better than the overhyped one from 2 years ago in the Super Bowl loss. As a cowboys fan we got a long way to go
chiefs in 7
"Eagles are great, the Kansas City Chiefs with Patrick Mahomes is completed overrated This game was boring af with little competition against the eagles lmao"
"Chiefs, Auto Tune and Taylor Swift are dead"
"Hurts needs to be in the elite conversation. His deep throws are very accurate. Eagles D-line was fantastic as well. The Chiefs kept doing the same thing on offense, and it was a hard watch."
Go!! Greens!!!
"Even the refs weren't going to stop the #1 defense in the league, an elite QB, and the greatest offensive line in NFL history. Team literally only truly lost 1 game, vs Tampa. Other 2 were fluke drops vs ATL and WSH. Put up, get this, NINETY-FIVE POINTS between the NFC title game and Super Bowl. Acknowledge it"
Hard for kc to win without refs lol
Refs couldn't bail them out of this one.
Man I think Travis and Pat are no longer friends. Dude put in as much effort as paint drying on the wall.
Eagles on top
I was mad when they negated the Jahan Dotson Touchdown but despite all that Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles are world champions and I'm happy that we won the Superbowl Championship and I'm happy!!! Let's go Eagles!!! Fly Eagles Fly!!! E A G L E S EAGLES!!! Happy Day in Philly!!! Philadelphia Eagles 2024 Superbowl Champs!!! Fly Eagles Fly!!! E A G L E S EAGLES!!! Victory is ours!!! How bout them birds in Philly!!! The Philadelphia Eagles deny the Kansas City Chiefs 3peat!!! Fly Eagles Fly!!! Philadelphia Eagles 2024 defending champs!!!
Mahomes was quite literally seeing ghosts
In your face Nick Wright
18:40 He let him catch that
Blame Taylor Swift for the Chiefs loss.
Chiefs got Blasted. OMG = No Fight - just got Steam-Rolled. 24-0 @ Halftime with 14 yards of offense ???
"Mahomes one of the best ""in the world""? Hey, Brady, don't forget, you ONLY (except some real amateur competitions) play American football (not even real football) in the US, so it is a NATIONAL sport, a NATIONAL championship (NO World Champions here). Leave the rest of us out of it, please. That said, take that Mahomes, Kelce, Swift."
Thank God it wasnt the Chiefs. - A Lions fan.
Nobody wanted the chiefs to win. They robbed the last one. What happened to the refs?
Nothing like seeing mahomes completely humiliated to remember every one that theres only one G.O.A.T and his name is Tom Brady
The Eagles made America great again
Too big to rig
I honestly think that shuffle pass was past the line of scrimmage now that I look closer at it. They got away with that one 14:08 that wouldnt have been a touchdown that drive that means
WOW What a disaster KC really lost big on this one.
Go Eagles !!
That was a great superbowl.
"Kermit the frog , Mr and Mrs Taylor Swift is crying"
Im a Steelers fan thank you eagles
"With the SB 59 title, the Philadelphia Eagles are the ninth NFL franchise with five overall titles (pre-Super Bowl and Super Bowl era). The other eight? Green Bay Packers with 13 Chicago Staley's/Bears with nine New York Football Giants with eight Boston/New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers with six each And the Eagles join the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, and Washington Redskins/Football Team/Commanders with five titles."
The world is healing
"I back the NFC, so I back the Eagles. They are not my team but, Congratulations to them. I just didnt want the Chiefs to win."
Chiefs defense were the only highlights for Kansas City. Their offense was a execution liability.
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
KC Chiefs Quarterback Mahomes sacked at least five times and a couple interceptions got scored as well. None was aligned in Chief's way.
6:13 WE'RE SO BACK BOYS
Xavier worthy vs the eagles
"Ya ven ,para que llevan a su barby"
"Wow , 1st completion to Kelce was late 3rd quarter. Eagles D- line won the game from the 1st snap."
defense deserves a mvp
Kanas city Thiefs
No Taylor Swift face today I wonder why??? Go Eagles
"Sirrianis final trick: saquon was just a distraction to get KC defense to hyperfocus him and leave the recievers wide open for hurts to ball out. Took the whole season to sell it but it paid off lol. Thank you philly, can't believe im saying it, for ending the mahomes goat talk for GOOD."
"No refs, no win"
The NFL and a bunch of braindead women are sad. Everyone else is happy.
The refs couldnt even help the chiefs this year they never had the ball they were beat so bad that refs basically said cant help you
Thank you Eagles great game and the refs didn't help you. Ladies and gentlemen your KC Cheats lmao.
The officials still sucked. Especially the two on the side that threw flags for OPI against Brown and the helmet to helmet against the Chiefs. In all though it looked pretty evenly called. It's amazing when it's evenly called and the Chiefs get dog walked.
Exposed much???
Mahomes and Kelce overrated nothing like Brady and Gronk
See what happens when the refs are not on your side? An actual game.
"Im gonna say this, born in Philly, Im happy that we got our second win. I still remember 2017-2018 season (Im close friends with Torrey Smith since our high school days) and won our first SB with Nick Foles! Made me so happy! Now, its safe to say, thank you Vic Fangio for changing our defense around, thank you for the rookies Cooper Dejean and Quinyon Mitchell, great bday gift to Saquon Barkley and Cooper Dejean, and now, this season is over with a smile on my face. FLY EAGLES FLY!!!"
Eagles had to make the score too big to rig. They ran that score up to make the refs a non factor this time.
I blame the Refs they didnt show up today
"Couldnt even start on his own team. Oh, and Dallas needs a new qb."
Two sacks and a pick 6 might be the best defensive series in a SB ever !
"I at least wanted a good game , not a blow out. That was crazy"
"Jalen Hurts, AJ Brown and Smith were all on the Crimson Tide Team"
"As a Cowboys fan, I am so happy for the Philadelphia Eagles who destroyed the Kansas City Chiefs. You made so many NFL fans happy tonight. Congratulations, Philadelphia Eagles!"
So happy the Chiefs got dusted
Andy Reid mustve been proud to finally see the Eagles win the Super Bowl
eagles dusted the chiefs in Superbowl fashion
Fly like an Eagle
Eagle's defense are some DAWGS!
"Crazy how people believe an event that charges millions for a 30 second commercial isn't rigged. You are all gullible no matter who wins. They all got paid, none of them care this was a scripted event. Anyone who still believes the NFL is legit is as gullible as muslims watching UFC or a 10 year old watching WWE."
Offense sells tickets. Defense wins games
made up
RIGGED
Total domination by the !
It was nice not see Taylor swift at all tonight
Worst 15-1 team of all time
If u been following Hurts since College yhen u know this SB was well deserve for this young man they doubted him since day 1
so fake ha
This new fox scorebug is absolutely atrocious. Did they make this last night?
"Everyone on the Eagles had a great game, but I think Cooper DeJean was the true winner in this Superbowl. A rookie, playing in the Superbowl, on his BIRTHDAY, gets a pick 6 on his first every interception in his NFL career. Dude must be euphoric tonight"
I can only imagine how much the eagles wanted this game
For 2 minutes I was a eagles fan. I hate both teems
How much the KC Quarter back gets in that gsme
"I didnt watch Im not happy that the Eagles won, but Im so happy that the Chiefs didnt."
Well it looks like the 1970s Steelers four titles in six years will still be unmatched.
Patriots fan here.. mahomes will never catch Brady and the chiefs franchise will never be what that pats did. I can't wait to see Nick wrong.
Mahomes.generational performance
Thanks voodoo City fore making Patrick mahomes play like Jalen hurts it's like they traded places
The only person I feel bad for Is Hopkins. Congrats Eagles!!
Mahomes no Brady. Brady still the GOAT.
Video about to be on repeat for all of offseason
eagles defence was insane this game
I wanted the Eagles to win but I never thought the Chefs would get slapped like that. Mahomes was off but his receivers had a lot to do with that.
great to see the 4th team for the chiefs didnt show up today... the Refs
Where are all the Chiefs fans that ran their mouths for the last 2 weeks ? No 3 peat what happened?
Whole world knew Refs were helping chiefs every game Nfl might have had a better sb with Detroit Eagles or Bills Eagles or Bills Detroit or Ravens Eagles or whoever deserved to be in it with Zero help from Refs.
FTC!!!
"The Chiefs will be in the superbowl again next year and the Eagles prob in another 3 or 4 years, as long as they have JalenH and hopefully SaquonB and even Nick S."
"The MVP for the Eagles was Maholmes. This was one of his poorest performances ever and it wasnt just because of the Eagles defense. Its not the 1st time he faced a great defense or a great pass rush, hes always still done his thing against them. He wasnt his great self tonight. Thats it."
Crazy to me how the chiefs can be down astronomically and the announcers are still gassing Mahomes on every play.
"Eagles fans, I believe all of America wanted you to win. We are all tired of Swift and the KC Ref's. Congrats!"
best eagles team ever.
"Tonight, the World dream KC was USA and Eagles was Russia !"
"The Eagles made sure the refs had no reason to protect their golden child, Mahomes"
No Joe and Troy??
"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED watching this in Durango COLORADO in one of our fancy hotels packed with KC fans in all their stupid garb! I was as obnoxiously cheerleading as POSSIBLE for the Birds! HA!!! it was sooooo fun! nearly got into a fight! HA! go friggin' home, Mahomes!"
The entire NFL is happy the Kansas City refs have lost.
Elliot with those 40-50 yard field goals....
No extending the play clock. Where was that all season?
"Mahomes sold..the game, he sacked, fumbles, passes that intercepted.."
Chiefs got body slammed. Theyre not used to getting stomped on
Worst Super Bowl in history so mad I lost $200 on this rigged game
Mahomes is one stat-padding MFer.
"Chiefs fan here. Hats off to the Eagles, especially the defense. Geez that hurt but great respect to you. Let's see if we can meet up for the SB next year."
Did the chiefs have the flu going around the locker room or something? They looked ill
Class Character Great decisions and Elite talent at QB is unstoppable. Slowed Barkley. But not Hurts. I can't imagine the hangover the Hurts Haters will have.
And they said defense dont win championships
"As much I was hoping for a 3 peat, the results were the refreshment the NFL needed, and I am happy with the fact that there will NOT be an asterisk on the winning team's ring this year."
13:04 The death blow
The *EAGLES* were like TANK
Im a Giants fan for life but tonight I was an Eagles fan nice work boys
Mohams is now goat to worst
"Horrible half time show.... the worst in history. Also, boring game."
bitter sweet I hate both teams but glad the refs couldnt affect the game. Now you see what the chiefs really are. They got Destroyed kinda like karma when they faced th 49ers both times they won there where Toms a penalties that werent called and after that they get back and get utterly demolished. Thats what the 49ers need to do to win agains the Queefs they need a all out performance where the refs cant affect the game and we see the results here
I hate both teams but I'm glad eagles won. can't stand the chiefs
What the Chiefs tried to do is take Barkley away and say Hurts you beat us. Hurts said um ya no problem. If there were any questions that Hurts was a franchise guy all questions were answered tonight. Shout out to Skip Bayless he called this on draft day.
wow Eagles caught the Chiefs on their worst day of their lives lucky Eagles
"Happy birthday, Cooper DeJean! All of Iowa and Philly loves you!!"
"I guess the Refs werent in the Chiefs back pocket in this game! So glad the Eagles won, now I hope we see less commercials with all these KC players in them & we all know which ones Im talking about HA HA. Word to the NFL get rid of Brady & Romo theyre the worst,2 years in a row had to mute the TV and listen to the game on Westwood One Radio."
I blame the REFS they didn't show uo Today 40 22
"Dont let the final score fool you, real final score is 40-6."
Kansas ty
Can we talk abt how ugly the scoreboard overlay was????
"Hey, the Chiefs were told for 2 weeks stop Saquon They came in with a plan and executed to perfection. They stopped Saquon. Too bad the whole league forgot that Jalen is a top tier QB and the Eagles will beat you anyway they need too. Fly Eagles Fly"
Where's mahomes wife at?
Screw the Eagles win the biggest highlight was the booooooos Tylor Shifty got
"No three peat this year chiefs,now you have to start all over and it wont happen,you had your chance and failed."
Congratulations to the City of Brotherly Love the Super Bowl is yours and I'm happy for all of you!
BORING
"What a beat down. I wish it had been a little closer. It just didn't really have much excitement. Unless you're a birds fan, then it was the best game ever I'm sure. I wish I'd bet on them. Somebody out there made some bank!!"
Did I just watch a superbowl or a slaughter?
I thought the refs were in the bag for the Chiefs again with that AJ Brown pass interference call on 4th down. Great to see the Eagles defense dominate Mahomes. 2 picks and a fumble that led to 17 pts.
D line wins Super Bowls
This was a superbowl
Okay I don't like neither teams but this game was rigged
That was an old school as whooping
"It shouldve been the Bills who got to the Superbowl, not the Chiefs This was an absolute blowout! But I suppose this is what happens when you dont have the refs on your side!"
The Chiefs didn't have enough money to pay the referees
Greta seeing Mahomo get decked after the cheap sot Barkely took form the K*nt City defense. A shame he got up and not concussed.
"While I have no issue with disliking Mahommes and the Chiefs Kingdom, what I personally don't understand is the insult and disrespect that Young Man is getting. I know it's supposed to just be a game, but he doesn't deserve this level of disrespect, particularly for someone who has won the super bowl three times and been to the super bowl four out of five trips. I for one knew the Chiefs won't win, the odds weren't just in their favour, and whether or not the birds, scored 40 points or more, it will not take away the greatness of number 15."
"UTree has to make a ""Congrats, Eagles (winning edition)"" vid."
Finally all the chief bandwagon can shut up
They Did all that talking hold that L
See when the refs stop helping the Chiefs? They become meh. Or was it Vegas wanted them to lose this time because a lot of people were betting on the Chiefs to win? They would have lost money.
Stupor Bore... at it again.
I remember the days of Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens. How things have changed!
Biggest beatdown since SB 48.
49 er fan here. My respect to the
All the Hurts doubters quiet af
As a Cowboys fan this is one of the darkest moments of my life.
This felt like broncos vs Seattle
Kansas City chiefs win the super bowl champions
1:00 old habits / 2:30 great make-up call Relatively good officiating after that
"The media wants so bad for white boy Tom Brady not to be the best player ever and replace him with Patrick, and clearly Mahomes cant sniff Bradys greatness."
Congrats Chiefs
MAHOME DISASTERCLASS!
Seeing the Eagles win another Super Bowl is simply amazing. I kept my receipts. Time for the haters to apologise to Jalen Hurts and Jake Elliot!
All I know is defense still win championship
How good to see the Kansas city cheats get there arses handed to them
Too busy worrying about # 26 forgot we got weapons for days .. fly eagles fly
2025 off to a great start
Chiefs shouldve never been there. They showed their true colors after hiding behind the refs all season
Thank you Eagles.... Sincerely AFC West.....Aloha
defense wins championships
"Wow Chiefs. You choose to Win the West, Win the one seed in your Conference, Josh Allen still keeps losing to you, and yet this is what happens when the refs can't help you win. Sorry Mahomes. No three peat for you. Also I think Philly deserved this."
Game over after pick 6
Why does everyone think its cool to hate the cheifs
cant believe this is real
"Best Super Bowl performance ever, since Brady retired"
Only bummer is that Jason wasnt on the team
The refs weren't boosting Mahomes in this game or in Super Bowl 55 against the Bucs. And both times they copped a shellacking.
Mahomes three peat I dont think so. Hes not Tom Brady.
FLYERS are champs...
14:13 Clearly over the line
This game was so sad that Taylor Swift is going to write a song about it!
The Kansas City Chiefs got the Taylor Swift curse
"When did we become so hated I remember when we were loved! Booed at the superbowl!! Dang, anyways my chiefs will bounce back.. Good game Eagles!!"
...TOO BIG TO RIG....
Congrats to the Eagles! Their defense was amazing!!
Sorry Kansas....Elon was not involved. How can you win?
"Gee the team that needed help from the refs to win nearly every game they played, finally got exposed when the stage and attention was too big to rig."
How's the Canadian watching this game Boring.
Chiefs got HUMBLED!
They didnt show Taylor Swift a single time after it was evident KC was gonna get spanked
Congratulations Eagles!! Thank you. No 3peat!!
Absolutely disgusting lowlife music at halftime
Chief the best team with the refs involved chiefs are the worst team without
"eagles defense was everywhere, their front four was making mahomes life miserable... congrats philly, one for the ages."
"To the NFL Universe: The Eagles were not the heroes we wanted, but the heroes we needed, like Knights...Shining !"
EAGLES FOREVER BABY
This sport is really boring
"Firstly, i didn't watch the game COZ I THOUGHT FOR SURE THE CHIEFS WERE GETTING HANDED THE GAME just like the NFL been acting like they badly want them to threepeat Secondly, lets not be fooled by the final score, that's a 40-0 blowout. on the chief's 1st touch down, second from last thrown, the shovel pass by Mahomes he was way past the line of scrimmage by over a yard (illegal forward pass). And those late scores the EAGLES had put reserves on defense to just feel they played the Superbowl too Thirdly, my take still stands even if the Chiefs had won, they didn't deserve the playoffs (champions) last year and this year also, being in 17 or 19 one score game wins does make you great (yes they were wins but dubious calls mainly made them win those 1 score games not Spag's defensive greatness not Mahomes Greatness not Andy Reid's greatness). To me they were the worst back to back champions, and after the bullcrap calls and Scrappy favourable wins they were getting this whole season, they would surely have automatically been the worst three peat team Fouthly, there were still some bad calls in this game, some against the chiefs, some against the Eagles, but thats how its supposed to be, if there's a bad call, be fair to both teams and dont let it be the reason one team wins. Reason Eagles won, was because of their offensive and defensive lines, Eagle's Swarmed Mahomes but Chiefs could not even touch Hurts, that's how a game is supposed to be played and won, not by bullsh!t calls to favor one especially Aiding a critical drive 5th, as my argument on Brady Mahones, Manning Rogers Brees and Montana, how ever the amount of Superbowl any won, give them all 2-3 second to throw nommatter the oppposing defense or offensive line protecting them, and tell me who still wins more or who still give their team a fighting chance with a bad o-line or defense. Remove the scrambling and buying 10 seconds just to throw and tell me who really is more clutch, higher IQ and more great. When all the careers are over who's games you repeat or remember out of interest and actually greatness of a game even in loses brady was clutch spectacular and must see TV Sixth, i think Mahones is one of the greatest ""talents"" and QB alongside Lamar and Vick *strictly coz of running and scrambling* and Rogers coz of his accuracy and efficiency, but he's not close to the greatest even at his Position.. besides scrambling, you also need IQ, Accuracy , Leadership, The-IT-Factor, The-Fear-Factor, clean wins, rememberable games (not jus moments) etc etc, and my question is Mahomes is good at that just like any good decwnt QB, but is he GREAT at that than Brady Montana and the others?"
Sometimes its impossible to rig a game. Taylor Swift getting soundly booed was a highlight for sure
Someone forgot to give the Eagles the script...
Should have happened to the chiefs 12 other times this season. They got carried by the refs all year
Wow. Birds were way too good. Chiefs 2026 watch TF out.
Handegg is such a silly game
KC Frauds finally exposed. Mahomes looked like Ian Book out there. Glad they finally called penaltues on 74. He holds and/or false starts every play.
I know people dont care about scoreboard designs but that new scoreboard looks boring.
im glad that the Chiefs Dynasty is finally over!
Best line of the highlights DECKED!
"Vendo isso na madrugada do dia 10/02/2025. ESTAMOS NA HISTRIAAA MASSACRAMOS A BUND@ DO HURTS Espero smp ver esse meu comentrio, das prximas milhares de vezes que verei esse SB"
Defensive win championship not mohomes go birds
The double sack into the pick 6 was the turning moment of the game. After that moment the chiefs were done. Unbelievable
Refs couldnt help in this one. It wasn't a one score game to have a ref decide on the outcome. Chiefs got man handled their fans got man handled. Great game
"This is THE BEST game The Philadelphia Eagles have ever played in their franchises history! Arguably, in the top 5-7 best games played in NFL history as well"
"Nah Fr, Mahomes Got Away With A Lot This year! So GLAD The Eagles Put their FOOT On Their Neck And kept it there!"
Cant tell me the bills or Texans woulda got rolled like this.
"Not surprised. Aside from Buffalo, the Chiefs didnt play anyone good since week 1."
hats off to KCs punter
Black guy won
"Drake: We plotted for a year, gave you inspiration / Make it to the SB, tell the world my reputation / Even knew youd share my minor admiration / All for the love of humiliation and my haters celebration"
Ohh nooo chiefs
Our defense kept us ahead the whole game
When the game is set fair this is the results
I wonder if Giants owner John Mara will get any sleep tonight ?
"Omg, 52 years And I witnessed perfection.. Thank you, Eagles, from a Texans fan.."
What a good revenge
This was Seahawks vs Broncos whooping.
"DeVonta Smith has ""The Triple Crown"""" 1. Heisman 2. College Championship 3. NFL Championship.....Congrats!!!"
Mahomes the real mvp for them two 6 picks and a fg where are all the chiefs fans?
This gonna be a legendary video to watch in the future
Andy Reid's check didn't clear.
"The only thing the chiefs were able to accomplish was keeping Barkley's numbers low, everything else was dominated by the Eagles"
Talk about Redemption
"As an avid Denver Broncos fan, thank you Philadelphia Eagles for the win! Yall did an amazing job! Congrats!!"
The offensive line gave up all game. Never had that happened. Until now
Whoever had Eagles parlays happy asl rn
"Fangio ate Mahomes for breakfast, lunch & dinner! Add a dominating O line performance & you have a dominant win. Bye bye Chiefs"
I'm so proud of my Eagles. They are such a humble team that played an insanely high IQ game of football this year and didn't let the adversity win.
"Fly Eagles Fly. Thank you so much for winning. Looking forward to tomorrows FTF to see if Nick Wrong will come in or call in a sick day. Congratulations to Philly. You plated one hell of a game. Defense was like a pack of hungry wolves, swarming Mahomes. Jalen and the offense did their thing too. 3 peat?"
Maholme got raided hahahah
THANK GOD THE CHIEFS DID NOT GET THAT 3-PEAT - TOTALLY OVERRATED AND UNDESERVING
Cooper is Our Jackie r
The worst SB i've ever watched.
Jaylen carter is a scary guy! Hes freaking violent
"final score 'Football' 40, 'Circus' 22. It was a great day for football, but don't worry about the circus--they'll be back."
i HATE THE CHIEFS
Eagles Defense were on locked down!!
Now I know the KC aint that good without refs lmao
Nobody saw a blowout coming let's be honest
"So the Refs tried, but the Chiefs did not deliver (expect delivering the Ball to the Eagles - Mahomes with 2 interceptions again *fg*)... Congratulation Eagles... and just for some Chiefs hate: Brady is still the"
"Finally, a new Super Bowl champion after two years!! Sorry to all chiefs fans the dynasty crumbled this game!! Fly Eagles Fly!!"
Travis d*ck wont be RED tonight
Great game! Congrats Eagles!!!
"i thought it would be closer, but i am happy for both teams. i like both"
Now we go sign myles to the defense and add another 1 next year #LOVEHURTS World champs EAGLES
"Wrong title, should be Eagles Superbowl highlights"
They never showed Taylor Swift when the Chiefs were losing.
this is a rout! congrats Eagles.. Chiefs distracted by the potential history!
There's just the slightest intimation in these comments that some people are a little happy about the Chiefs losing. Maybe I'm reading too much into those comments....
I thought it was high school team vs NFL team..then I realized it was superbowl game..congrats birds we did it
Nick and Jalen deserve there respect
"Mahomes was a disaster, Kelce was a disaster and Taylor Swift was a disaster! Couldn't be happier. Chiefs finally broken !"
Everyone thought the Chiefs where going win this Super Bowl 59 but it didnt happen lesgoooo Eagles!!!
Mahomes got chefs 2 td at the end with the Eagles rocky so yeah good job PH however Congratulations Eagles Champions
The refs couldnt even help the chiefs this year they never had the ball they were beat so bad that refs basically said cant help you
34-0 40-6 don't let the final score fool you
Coming from a Saints fan congratulations Eagles you won it in our house and I proudly salute your team and thank you all very much for beating the Chiefs.
They got served.
It took the Avengers twice to beat Thanos.
"Perfect example of what happens to cheaters-eventually it catches up to you and youre outed as the fraud youre. Thank you NFL for prioritizing story lines over the actual product, your culminating game of the year is a blowout #shouldhavebeentheravens"
The Chiefs has been infected by Tom Brady curse ever since that Superbowl 28-3 lol
"Patrick Mahomes is saying goodbye, people was tripping. And now he's switching to the amazing I-phone."
So this is what happens when we take the night off
"Real ""swift"" game you had Kelce"
"Anyone else think now that Kelce lost the Superbowl as Swift's boyfriend Swift will move on, lol, and make a song about him called Not Good Enough......women A measly 39 yards and 0 touchdowns, like EWWWWWWWWWW, Babe I won the superbowl last year, Um yeah like you are like soooooooo last year, GOODBYE!!!!!!!! OMG I LIKE SOOOOOOO CANNOT BE SEEN WITH A LOSER!!!!!!!! MY REPUTATION IS LIKE ON THE LINE, UGH!!!!!!!!"
The Chiefs should have not been in that game in the first place.
Only the second black QB to win a sb
Congrats eagles!
Eagles scored so many tushdowns!
This reminds me of when TB12 n the Pats DESTROYED P.M. TB12 will always be the GOAT.
Green Sunday.
refs can't save the cheifs forever by bye never going back to the finals with mahomes
Thank God KC Swifty is done for. No 3peat
Mahomo thought he was in the goat conversation lol keep dreaming boy you and your tight end who has a APB out for his name Mr kelce lol both wankers
"What highlights . Kansas City Chiefs are annihilated. Total choke by Mahomes, will be a big blot on his career."
The refs stayed out of it Chiefs get smoked. They never stood a chance.
Put some respect on the name Jalen Hurts
"Congratulations to Eagles team on winning the 2025 championship. Im a 49ers fans and of course Im rooting for Eagles team, after what KC did to 49ers last year. This game was revenge for Eagles team from last 2 previous season and 49ers last season.."
Chiefs lmao
Jalen Hurts officially has one of the greatest comeback stories in the history of American Football. Extremely happy for that young man
mr and mrs swift got humbled keeo crying lol
"A lot of ppl watching with me complained that the game was boringas a bengals fan and a chiefs hater I couldnt disagree more, I could watch the chiefs get pounded on repeat thank you Philly"
"Its all rigged, but Im glad the Queefs didnt get another trophy"
"As a 49er fan, thank you Philly."
"As a 49ers fan , I'm glad the eagles won"
"5:52 craziest play since Super Bowl 52. Patrick getting sacked twice, on the third play Cooper intercepted the ball and gave the touchdown to the Eagles. Eagles Defense team was on a whole another level"
They got that short piledriver down to a SCIENCE!
I gotta say this aint the first time Mahomes and the Chief turning up MIA in the big game. They did something similar against Tampa Bsy
"I do not like Tom Brady at all, but dont ever compare Patrick Mahomes to Tom Brady ever again"
lol chiefs receivers and linemen are kinda feel pressured.
No contest and that's the last you will see KC in the superbowl for a while lol
"Coach reid can we hear from you? "" NO ONE HAS EVER BUNDLED THREE SUPERBOWLS TOGETHER NO BUNDLEROOSKI THIS YEAR PATRICK "" ! ! !"
"I saw 4000 people watching an ""AI"" Philly and Chiefs Super Bowl and just laughed..comments were turned off of course."
"Jalen deserved that SB MVP, he cooked"
Eagles on top
That Philly D aint no joke
Incoming Travis and Taylor break up
So let's put this GOAT debate to bed now please. It sounds more stupid the more you watch this whole video. I enjoyed every second of that beatdown too.
First Time watched this sport Because My GOAT Messi was there It's not bad like what we Easterners speak. Loved it.
Hilarious how the commentators are laying on the cope for Mahomes and the chiefs
Fly eagles fly
"The media wants so bad for white boy Tom Brady not to be the best player ever and replace him with Patrick, and clearly Mahomes cant sniff Bradys greatness."
"I'm just saying, Brady never got blown out in the Superbowl. If anything he lost multiple championships thanks to his head coach"
Defense still wins Championship!
Major love for boldin he was ball hawking BUT THEM EAGLES
Go Birds. It was payback time.
AJ Brown a beast
As a Raider I feel like 31 teams won the Superbowl today FLY EAGLES FLY...CRY SWIFTIES CRY
Coop
"WHAT A SEASON FOR THE EAGLES, FLY EAGLES FLY"
To be honest I wasn't going to watch the superbowl because I thought that the chief's would 3 peat again. I'm so glad that the eagle's took care of business tonight and crushed them fair and square. The eagle's dominated on all trenches tonight and it's a well deserved victory for the Philadelphia eagle's. Congrats to the eagles for winning the superbowl .
KC got served
The Eagles are now 2-0 in Super Bowls with Wentz on the sidelines
This embarrassing defeat proves that the Chiefs didn't belong in the SB. They had help all season and were spoon fed the championship by the refs...
Defense win championships
Officials must have not received the KC check
"Huge congratulations to the Eagles on their Super Bowl LIX win! Your performance was outstanding, and you truly deserved this victory."
What a beatdown! Especially when they panned to Taylor and Mahommes threw a pick!!!
FLY EAGLES FLY
Taylor Swift secretly happy cause her Philly team won
"The media caused this. They were trying to crown Patrick Mahomes as the GOAT after winning three Super Bowls but losing head to head in his prime vs Brady at the end of his career or if he three-peated which would still only be 4 Super Bowl wins. Mahomes is playing in the most QB-friendly as far as rules, too. His stats and points scored have plummeted without Tyreek Hill. Brady won all his Super Bowls without a star wide receiver, he lost with Randy Moss."
As a raiders fan thank you to the eagles now its up to us in the regular season they never go back
"Always proud of our guys. Great game, the better team won. We will be back, you can count on it. #Chiefskingdom"
Yeah Philly show what's is like when you beat the referees and all
"To Eagles fans: Congrats, you got a great team there, absolutely dominant. To Chiefs fans: !!!!!!!!! Sincerely, A Raiders fan"
Chiefs cant win in an honest match
E.A.G.L.E.S EAGLES!
Glad that the team with studs playing inside a system wins over the team with superstars improvising
Sack-trick Mahomes
MY BOYSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
"Refs don't help You see, kc was not that good of a team."
I guess Travis wont be giving those sad flat back shots to good ol Taytay tonight
Glad the eagles wontired of hearing about chiefs
Chiefs only scored those last TDs because the eagles put there back ups in lmao
"I love my team so much, go birds!!"
Go eagles Insane game
Thank you Eagles!!!
Hurts shut the haters up Superbowl MVP
It was nice not seeing Taylor Swift win the SB again. She'll have to write a song about her breakup soon
What's with the scoreboard design? Are we going back to the 80's now?
Pat riley is pissed!
Kelce getting beat. dude won't admit he's lost a step or three.
This may he the one time that NOT giving Barkley the ball worked perfectly.
Is must to post this video?I dont see any important LMao
Great Philadelphia. How they dominated...insane performance. The 40-6 score was more adequate for this game.
"Man. Glad I didnt watch the game. The Rams vs Eagles was a much better game imo. The zebras couldnt help the Chiefs this game. They tried early on, but it just shows that the NFC is much better than the AFC."
this means 1.Brady 2.Montana 3.Mahomes?
"Da Bears will be here next year, they have to be, they tried 3 head coaches"
bubbas gonna lose it
This is the one game that will haunt Mahomes for the rest of his life and Nightmares.
"Love lift us up where we belong, Where the EAGLES cry, On a Mountain high."
NFL trying to save face.
Long overdue. Frauds all year.
"Chiefs fans are coping so hard, the irony of crying about refs, whole reason youre even in the SB is the refs cope harder LOL"
Made saddy mahomes look bad
Da chiefs sorry ASF lmao .. devontae Smith and Jalen hurts played together in Alabama..
Mahomes still going out there down 40-6 to make it look like he didnt get destroyed by the Eagles. Absolute loser stuff.
Should have just stopped the game in the third quarter Chiefs got their butts handed to them
See what happens when the refs actually do their job correctly?
"To think that a few years ago, JH was benched in the CFP, after leading 'Bama all year to the championship. Lost at his first attempt for SB. Get's back, and his team has a statement game. That is a model resilience, and demonstration of character. Congrats to the Eagles, their defense, and to JH!"
Chiefs was exposed this game
Fly Eagles fly. Thank God that corny Chiefs and Swifties reign is over.
congrats to the eagles. i thought the game was going to be a lot closer but the eagles dominated the chiefs
The Eagles can only seem to win against dynasty teams they've lost to once.
Script changed huh Eagles? Based on yalls narrative then you only won bc NFL made Chiefs lose bc yall whined and cried boycotts. Your logic not mine not cool huh
Mahomes was playing for the Eagles tonight
Get rid of Brady ffs
Was not expecting the Refs to lose the Superbowl this year.
"3 Peat is not gonna happen for Kansas City Chiefs, congratulations Philadelphia Eagles"
Tom YounDeserve better then FOX BS RUPERT MURDOCK NEEDS TO GO BACK IN HOLE HE CRAWLED OUT OF! Your.BS station should have been shut by now! Tom Brady get.out of there. Start your Own Sports center..I'll.subscibe! Go To Hell Rupert Murdock!
"oh, look what happens when you dont have the refs in your back pocket"
Tampa fans Philly fans Patrick Mahomes big brother club
the worst offensive performances by both QBs in SB history
Rigged
That hit at 9:40 of the 4th quarter is easily the hardest hit Mahomes has taken his entire career
"Worst Super Bowl Ever, from a non-Eagles and non-Chief fan"
Mahomie Ken't C the light
"To all the chiefs fans who said that we are casuals for saying this chiefs team was due for a lossman this was a big one. Eagles looked like the better team by the mile, the afc is only getting better and the eagles, 9ers, lions dont seem to be going anywhere either. This hill could start to get a lot steeper for the chiefs. Either way, great season by them. Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are absolutely incredible, Im sure theyll be back and ready for redemption next season"
People are hating on the Kansas City Chiefs. The referees they have nothing to do with the Chiefs winning three championships. The Chiefs find a way to win three. Philadelphia was just the better team. Philadelphia played well all season they played great they played like the best team. I had a feeling that the Chiefs would lose and they did and that's no big deal.
"Can't wait for all the memes. Swift getting booed, refs carrying KC with all the bad calls for the last 2 seasons, ect."
This is what happens when the refs stay out of the game. Teams play and the better on the day wins. Great
Dang the the cheifs o line was playing terrible 6 sacks reminds me of my chargers
It really proves how mediocre the Chiefs are without the assistance of the refs... loving every second of it!
Biggest L - Chiefs O-Line or the Halftime Show?
Turns out when ur ref buddies are on the bench a better team comes and wins
Sorry Swifty's better luck nexttime.
"All in all, sloppy and poor football"
Chiefs fan here congratulating the Eagles. Hell of a defense as well as a great offense. Eagles could be next dynasty.
eagles beat the refs
Chiefs got exposed for what theyve been all year. Refs couldnt save them this time.
"Although Hurts won the MVP award in Super Bowl 59, the entire Eagles' defense was the key to their big win in the game because their linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties blanketed the KC receivers forcing Patrick Mahomes to hold onto the football longer than he wanted to which gave the Eagles front 4 defensive linemen time to get to Mahomes not only sacking him 6 times - amazingly without even blitzing on any of the plays that resulted in a QB sack- , but also pressuring him into making off-balance throws! Congratulations Eagles!!!! . Thank God the nitwitted, unanalytical thinking mainstream news media now can't proclaim the Kansas City Chiefs as the GOAT NFL team in history because that is what they ridiculously would have asserted if the Chiefs had won three Super Bowls in a row!"
Cheifs looked super pedestrian. got handled. Philly was the Best team from the git. Question..where was Travis Swift? Eagles were the best team and Cheifs ran into a ban-saw..
This is beautiful
eagles did exactly what Tampa did to mahomes and shut him down
JaLeN hUrTs CaN't ThRoW!?!?!
"Im a simple man. I see the cheaters lose, I hit like"
Brady never got blown out in a Super Bowl btw
Best Super Bowl ever
6:50
Eagles beat Brady and Mahomes
First time I didn't watch an Ad all the way thru. Did the NFL actually not need the ad revenue for once?
uga football! Go Dawgs!!!
"Im happy the eagles won, but I also wish the refs hadnt cheated the bills in the AFFCG so that we could have seen a real Super Bowl. Eagles exposed the chiefs big time"
Taylor swift is the bad luck
sho Hops & Dejean o/
Fly Eagles fly
Thank God the Eagles won. You know little Pat is crying and coach Swift is not happy
That eagles defense throwing in the sacks .
I hate the Eagles but I can't stand the Chiefs.
Fck the chiefs
The Eagles led by OKLAHOMA QUARTERBACK Jalen Hurts to Super Bowl victory!!! Alabama fans cant cope with the fact they benched him for TUA. First OU quarterback to start and actually win a superbowl!! Long overdue but what an absolute joy to watch the chiefs lose and eagles win
"As a chiefs fan this obviously didn't go very well, but I'm not gonna be bitter - the Eagles did great and this was a very well-deserved win!"
i know nothing about this sport but this Phili defence looks crazy.
Chiefs were just not good enough today plain and simple! Eagles deserved it they were the better team. Onto next season
Refs can only help them when its a closer game
"Just want to call this out as a bucs fan: When the chiefs lose on the big stage, they get shallocked.. so can we finally take away this notion that Mahomes is a GOAT?! Because he is not.."
Jalen Carter smacked the sht outta Mahomes lol
"No disrespect to Hurts, but there needs to be a way for the whole Eagles defense to win Superbowl MVP. They allowed the Chiefs one 1st down in the first half, on top of the 2 picks."
The Chiefs LET THE EAGLES WIN OUT OF SYMPATHY. End of story.
Mahomes really pulled the Chris Paul hits a huge 3 to cut the lead to 42
This game was boring.
"The Philly Dawgs wasn't going to be denied this year and this game, been a while since the Chiefs have been dominated like this"
The irony hearing Tom Brady disagreeing with a ref call
The GOAT discussion will stay with Brady forever
The TD psss @ 13:09 to the ref was amazing lol I loved that.
"Mahomes and co are now 3-2 in rhe super bowl. Thats definitely business class, but definitely not first class anymore."
NFL is the best sport. It's 1 game win or lose.
Eagles Def are the MVPs
The Chiefs have fallen/
"This should've been the outcome 2 years ago, that eagles defense had 71 sacks, the sod father the KV native helped the chiefs out. That why they gave him a super bowl ring at the parade. You couldn't win on a penalty this time Kansas City"
Fly Eagles Fly! Roll Tide!
Smitty revisits his touchdown that gave Alabama the win
Vegas won. Everyone betted on kc
Less commercials and more practice next season KC?
Chiefs literally let them have it
I dislike TS so I am rooting for Phillie....
AMERICA WON feels so good kc lost
5:58 the two Eagles outside D line went crazy together on that play.
"Unlike the last time the Eagles and Chiefs met in the SB, Philly's D came through for Jalen Hurts."
"Didn't watch the game, came to read comments."
Yet another blowout by halftime Super Bowl. I bet the people who paid millions for 30 seconds of ad time *after* that game was 24-0 were just so thrilled about that.
"I am from st.louis, so I'm a chiefs fan. I'm proud of their 3 championships. Yet I have no problem saying congratulations, Philadelphia!! You dominated on both sides of the ball. Don't let people cheat you of your moment because the referees didn't give chiefs any calls. You outplayed the opponent in every way. An absolutely dominating performance. I love my chiefs. But I love the game of football itself even more. Thus, I recognize a great performance when I see it. Even if it's against my team. Great job.! Congratulations!"
Where is kelce
Lol Nolan Smith 15:56
Crazy when the refs call a fair game the chiefs can't do anything. The bills would have made for an actually interesting game.
Were gonna run some clock Jalen: Ive got other plans.
I was tired of the Swifties!!
"As an Aussie hats off to the Eagles & a big cheers to Malaita, he has been a beast all year & proved this ex rugby player is up there with the best! Hurts had all day to do what was needed..."
"5:48-6:25 Sack, Sack, Pick 6. One of the craziest defense sequences in super bowl history."
Goodell had too much heat on him. Refs weren't allowed to win it for Mahomes.
"Old Pats Fan sez, Way to go, Eagles! Congratulations on outstanding prep and 60 minutes of killer play O and D!"
No 3 peat eagles exposed the cheifs and btw look how thr cheifs plsy without the refs.brady would never get beat this bad in the super bowl lol.saying pat better than brady is like saying bron better than jordan brady still the goat by far
E A G L E S EAGLES!
Mahomes will never be a goat there was only one. Brady.
"Congratulations, Philadelphia Eagles!!"
Remember all that BS about the fix being in for KC? Yep. It's called lying for clicks.
Hey y'all!--How you all doin in Kansas City tonight??? *crickets* LOL
Was that the Real Patrick Mahome playing the Super Bowl tonight or someone else playing him?
Goes to show the chiefs had no business here carried all the way here by the refs
Eagles dominated the refs....and im glad to hear everyone booed that 30 year old who pretends to be 13
Congratulation to my Philadelphia Eagles when I came to America in 1991 I did not understand NFL game and I watch the Eagles because Im from the Philadelphia area and I learned the game and they were my first team and Im so happy for them congratulation Eagles love love my EAGLES
"Dear Philly fans, please leave the downtown light poles alone tonight. Light pole grease is expensive. And you guys use up the supply every time something good happens in town."
"Chiefs ""kingdom"" eating D's tonight"
"The Chiefs were already the most mediocre ""dynasty"" ever. Mahomes needed comebacks to squeak out Super Bowl wins vs Garoppolo and Purdy. He got blown out by an aging Tom Brady. Mahomes could easily be 0-5 in Super Bowls and he pulled out close playoff wins or he wouldn't even get that far. Their offense has been bad for two full seasons. 12 wins by a single score?!! Terry Bradshaw is 4-0 in Super Bowls beating Hall Of Fame QBs Tarkenton and Staubach. Joe Montana is 4-0 in Super Bowls with blowout wins vs Hall Of Fame QBs Marino and Elway."
That's what I call an as..... whipping.
Thank you Philly!
The eagles have LIBERATED us from that cheat peat!!!!
"There were some absolutely nuts stats for Philly's defense, but for me the craziest is that the play at 13:55 was the first time all game the Chiefs crossed midfield."
Jalen Hurts is the 1st QB (not named Mahomes) drafted in 13 or after to win a Super Bowl No 1st rd QB drafted in 10 or after aside from Mahomes has won the Super Bowl
"Imagine having the refs get you so far just to give you a chance to make NFL history, to then choke so incredibly hard that now we just feel bad that youre gonna be one of the last teams in the draft trying to pick a new O-line."
E. A. G. L. E. S.
As an Eagles fan i cant wait to see this Micd up I can hear BG now
Eagles got their revenge
Cooper Dejean is not a safety!!!! Go birds
To all the cheifs fans around the world........ah ha ha ha ha
All you Mahomes fans can get up now I know those knees hurt
Mahomes is the most overrated QB in History.
So happy to see Mahomes and KC put in their place. An absolute thrashing! Celebrate Eagles fans!
Who won MVP
EAAAAGLES
Bro this scoreboard is
Miss Piggy beat up Kermit the frog.. domestic violence at its best
Chiefs aren't competitive when the refs aren't helping them out.
The evil has been defeated
Man I cant believe it. What an unbelievably season for my birds. They deserve it especially Jalen Hurts he was awesome tonight. Think I just witnessed the greatest Eagles team of all time
The Eagles made sure there was no coming back for KC.
Chiefs defense win this. Hurtz honestly wasnt all that good but the Defense was amazing
"How crazy this blowout revenge of SB57 rematch can be, even blind YouTuber Molly rooted for this underdog. Actually, a great one, no more three-peat, and no more ref rigging. Maybe who is real winner behind the scenes in addition to Eagles, like true avengers. Maybe this is how Eagles built for defense just like how Texans have renewed emphasis on defense, and they deserve to avenge :)"
Fly Eagles fly... Steelers fan.... Nice work
The United States is healing :)
Nice to see the eagles beat the chiefs. I'm a bit sick and tired of all the preferential treatment the chiefs seem to get from the refs.
13:03 My fav play out of the entire game
I belive 90% of NFL fans are happy today
"The Eagles just mauled the Chiefs, such an exquisite moment. GG Philly, you guys are most definitely the Super Bowl champs and we're all stoked about that."
The media scrum after games is pretty gross and so American
To all the haters we are them now bow down
This was the most boring superbowl ive ever watched
"5:47 Sacked, sacked & intercepted consecutively in 3 downs sum up Chiefs tonight."
"If Im Mahomes, Im putting ALLLLLLLLL my liquid assets that can be put in someone elses name, on the eagles winning. Thats an easy payday."
But hes the goat yeah ok
Looks like the Chiefs forgot to pack their spare in this one because they just got blown out!
"Mahomes is mediocre at best when he is under any kind of pressure (Just ask the Bucs), Definately not the G.O.A.T. folks like to think he is... This was another great exposure of that ."
I predicted the eagles would win the Superbowl but not this bad
"That halftime show was terrible, try some kid rock and lynyrd skynyrd next year please for the love of god"
"This is prove, even a greatest QB can't perform when his OL got out physical and out play. I forgive Geno Smith now."
"Chiefs run defense was absolutely phenomenal, but they couldn't really stop the passing game. Eagles defense had arguably the best Super Bowl performance ever, they didn't even blitz and they still sacked Mahomes 6 times, and forced 3 turnovers. Chiefs offense couldn't get a single thing until the very end of the 3rd quarter, and Eagles offense was consistently good. One of the most lopsided games ever, and a pleasant surprise for everyone who's not a chiefs fan."
"I AM AN EAGLES FAN, BORN AND RAISED. HOWEVER, TO BE HONEST, DONT THINK THAT SPORTS BETING DONT PLAY A ROLE IN THESE GAMES. KANSAS CITY WERE MOST OF THE FAN #1 PICKED TEAM TO WIN THE SPORTS BET. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PAY ALL THOSE PEOPLE SO WE WON. ALTHOUGH WE PLAYED REALLY GOOD ALL SEASON , JUST DONT BE SUPRISED ABOUT THE SPORTS BETING NONSENSE!"
Don't bother watching this one.
Highlights = KC got decimated. There was no game. Eagles dominated most of the game. Every other play was a sack on Mahomes. I loved it.
No Taylor Swift shots today HUH! Love the camera man for showing the look on Kelces face! Humbled!
Alternate title: Birds maul natives for 20 minutes
Frauds exposed
Sooner beat the Red Raider...Good job Jalen....MVP ... Rumor has it there were 7 Sooners involved in the Superbowl...
"Even though this was a blowout, I respect Mahomes for not looking defeated throughout, unlike Kelce. I felt bad for him, ngl..."
"That D line played lights out,the most dominating and timely performance for any franchise. The Eagles took a page from the Giant's SB win against the undefeated Pat's. If you give the QB NO TIME to make a play, he can't beat you no matter how good he is. Smothered Mahomes like the Giants did Brady and gave him absolutely no time to make a play or work that Mahomes magic he has. Well done Philly, and Congratulations, Barkley truly deserves this ring, KC has theirs already so it's past due someone else stands in the spotlight."
Kobe will be proud !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you eagles
"Glad K*nt City Swifties lost. Philly, E_A-G-L-E-S EAGLES."
The World Won Today
"Guess they had to let them play actual football tonight, the fix will be in again come this September..."
It looks like the ref didnt play for the Chiefs this time lol
"Fumble-rooski, fumble-rooski, fumble-rooski. It is fun to say now."
40-6 is the real score
That AJB PI embarrassinggggggg
Taylor swift leaving travis kelce
"did they mean ""Eagles Highlights"""
"DeJean's interception and subsequent TD, and Devonta Smith's monster TD are the most merorable for me with Super Bowl LIX"
"How's about them EAGLES"" FLY EAGLES FLY..."
Not even the refs could save the Chiefs from this shellacking!
Demolished!!
Just crazy that the Bills couldn't beat these guys.
Sorry Taylor no after party for you
It was delicious to see KC lose.
I'm not sure which was worse... the game itself or the halftime show?
im glad Saquon won ..ngl'doe iwanted them chiefs to pull it off tho fr fr congrats to gillie&philly.. The parade is gonna be a movie for sure. 1luv from nyc.
"I thought Philly had a decent chance of pulling out a win, but literally no one wouldve predicted this blowout."
Philadelphia Eagles are the Super Bowl Champs
Mahonmey reminds me of Missande. Propped till the mainstream just says NO.
"The Chiefs had enough money to buy a season, but not enough to buy a super bowl lol"
It's actually wild how dominant the D-Line was considering all that uncalled holding. Just complete and utter domination.
Burkhardt's call at 13:00 is legendary
Congratulations to Saquon Barkley for winning the Super Bowl on his birthday as well.
Patrick go homes
"Seriously, from all the endless bs and glazing weve faced from the Chiefs fans this year, the Chiefs losing on the biggest stage on the planet is the most euphoric feeling. A happy ending after all."
So did the Chiefs plan on playing today? Thank you Eagles.
That Pass rushing from Philadelphia is what won them this championship. Completely shut down MAHOMES
Farewell SuperBowl 2025!
Man I thought it next week. Dang what disappointment.
Great D#
Chiefs O line was so bad tonight. They all need to be released
I guess the NFL is NOT RIGGED
Good job Philly. Played great game. Chiefs were horrible. Should have let the bills in the Super Bowl because they didnt deserve to be there.
Josh Sweat should have got the MVP
Cancun on 3!
they won this game mentally on the first down on that 4th and 2 that got called back on the first drive. that was ballsy to be that aggressive but it absolutely set the tone and delivered the message to the chiefs that the eagles were comin' for that
I said it all week.. The only way the eagles could stop the refs is if they got a big enough lead so no matter what the refs couldn't help the chiefs
Script writers really pulled an M Night on this one. What a satisfying twist
PM15 will break TB12 superbowl record. Oh sure!.
"Mahomes biggest fear, white cornerbacks"
"Everyone better start putting Hurts in that top 5 Qb conversation. This man literally outplayed Mahomes in two Superbowls . Has beaten Lamar, Burrow,Love, Allen,etc. . Is 2-1 against Mahomes . Super Bowl Champ SuperBowl MVP . Eat your words haters . This man just wins ."
Best Eagles Defense I've Ever Seen Pure Domination
no wet horrible field and the eagles destroy the chiefs.
Wow number 29 reads the play switchup very well at 12:50
No diario comen guajolote los Chiefs ya se acostumbraron a que los rbitros les hacen favores como les hicieron cuando jugaron con Buffalo no valen nada en todo estn acostumbrados a que les den los favores ese tipo de rbitros no deben salir ms a las canchas fuera Chiefs para fuera arriba los Eagles
As a buckeye fan this is the best a natty and a Super Bowl in the same year go
I hate the Chiefs! Go Raiders...
"Looks like it's the end of a short lived Dynasty. The Chiefs got their star players getting older and slower, way over budget just paying Kelce and Mahomes and the team is very unbalanced. It might be time for a reset."
AAAAND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE REFS ARE TOLD NOT TO HELP THE CHIEFS OR IT WILL BE TO OBVIOUS LOL even on the td to Worthy the o line was holding lmaoo
Crazy
Hurts new name to the chiefs : hurtsdonut
Agree. Was passed the line of scrimmage and no flags. Chiefs dont win without the refs.
Eagles locked Mahomes DOWN
Eagle's did their thang for real congratulations . And Drake will never come back from being dissed nationwide with his ex dancing on it.
The least interesting game of all time for any true sports fan.
Chiefs were so worried about saquon they forgot about everyone else lol
Hahahahaha no 3 peat for you losers chiefs fans
1. Taylor Swift didn't deserve to be booed. 2. LOL on Blake Lively and RR not being there. PoS couple. Haha
"It's been proven, cheaters never get away with it."
This score bug is horrible. It looks like the computers crashed so theyre using a Wii. Did Elon send the Fox NFL graphics team home to save on pixels?
FLY EAGLES FLY
What a game You Tube world congrats to the Philly Eagles MLB is next the road too October will begin soon
"Just like that, the only chance to make history in the nfl is now over. R.I.P"
Broncos fans say yayyyahuhaaaa!!!!
SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS GAVE THEM BOYS THE BELT GO BIRDS
Just amazing... I'm speechless. FLY EAGLES FLY!
America won
Lived tonsee the eagles win 2 superbowls! fly eagles fly!!!
Ref couldn't save this game for them even if they tried and broadcast still talking about how great mahomes is not a eagles fan but one time it's not gonna hurt Fly Eagles fly
For the rest of the AFC west you are all welcome
18:04 I rewatched this play at least 100x
"Thank you, Eagles, all the way here from New Zealand I Thank you for making me 5k richer"
"FLY EAGLES FLY, WE ARE CHAMPIONS BABY!!!"
not today Kermit and the Refs
I wish I could frame a video GOOO BIIRRRDDDSSSSSS
"You look at the last 3 years, and these two teams are the top two in that span of time and its not particularly close. I think the rest of the league needed to see the chiefs get beat though to remind themselves that KC is indeed human and capable of losing."
"Total Domination. FLY EAGLES FLY Barkley broke the record for rushing yards and total yards from scrimmage through the regular season, plus post season. Both record were held by Terrell Davis since 1998. Congrats to Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts, to Cooper Dejean and his birthday pick 6, Brandon Graham for his amazing comeback, to Elliot nailing every kick, to AJ Brown and Devonta Smith. Im glad you both got touchdowns. Congratulations to Josh Sweat and that pass rush, to Coach Sirianni and Howie Roseman, and to the whole team. You earned those rings, fellas"
Referees lose!
So glad swifties lost
"What a hype game full of defense, eagles were almost scored while chiefs were all barred by Phila defense. One of the best defensive games ever seen in a Super bowl. 6sacks, 2 interceptions less ball possession for the chiefs. EAGLES champs!!"
Script hit reset.
It was supposed to be bills vs eagle. I am happy eagle won.
Ben voyons don !!! Cest arrang avec le gars des vues :(
"Eagles defense over performed today. To show up on the biggest stage against potentially one of the greatest QBs ever and deliver that sort of performance was crazy. To me, the entire D should be the MVP of this game."
16:15 doesn't really matter but that was hands to the face of the QB on Carter.
Wanna guarantee refs can't dictate the winner? This is how you leave no doubt who deserved the win. Maybe it's just me but I thought it was pretty shitty the Chiefs didn't let the backup QB take a single snap even when it was obviously over. To be able to say you PLAYED in the SB is a lifetime memory and achievement. Even if it's just one play...It changed my whole perception of the Chiefs
This game was so obviously rigged. I feel sorry for people who pay money for these staged events
Worst half time show ever.
The fact that this defense was able to get SIX SACKS while hardly blitzing is INSANE!!!!! GO BIRDS!!!!!
I'm done it's all Scripted and fake
"I hope the 49ers, and their coach are taking notes."
5:46 love how he hits his teammates helmet fly eagles fly love how hurts pulls his pants up after he gets tripped 8:22 love how he wiped his helmet off
"Congratulations, Philadelphia Eagles on winning the SB."
LETS GOOO BIRDS we won again lets keep it up. E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!!!!!!!
They didn't come here to change the past..... They came here to change the future
!!! .
Congrats Eagles
Lets go Eagles
No refs straight ball and all of it was legal contact
LETS GO EAGLES !!!!
I had eagles winning but not like this this was brutal to watch
Mowed Down The Packers Mowed Down The Rams Mowed down the Commanders MOWED DOWN THE CHIEFS Poor Taylor Poor Travis THE EAGLES ARE THE SUPER BOWL LXI CHAMPIONS Let the celebration begin!
The bills wouldnt even score 20 points if they made it to the Super Bowl.
"Did not think the Chiefs would goose-egg nearly through three quarters. Now you gotta wonder if the Bills would have done any better. I think the Chiefs got some help in that game to make it here, only to get shellacked."
Congrats eagles! Chiefs will be back nothing you guys can do about it
Patrick with an 11 qbr. One of the lowest in Super Bowl history!
Copper Dejean is a true MVP
14:14~
The chiefs are sorry
"KC didnt even show up in this game, never seen KC got beaten so bad on a game with Mahome as a QB"
"Refs can help with a close game, but this is what happens when they play an actual team. Chiefs are not a good team."
Vegas wins as usual. Always follow the money.
Bundle rooskie bundleroosskieee BUNDLe rooooskiiiieeee!
Looks like the gambling gods favored the eagles
"I am from Europe and watched Super Bowl for the first time. Boring game that was basically done after 1 hour, lame halfway show with lame music and MVP is not someone from defense of Eagles? This sports and event is not worth of any hype."
Welp. They stopped Saquon tho
Never thought this would be the most one sided Super Bowl in history Eagles absolutely swept the floor with the flags Chiefs racked up to get here
the only team to beat mahomes in the super bowl is his O line
"Can this premature thought of comparing Brady and mahomes be put to rest for the time being now???? Is he good yes, without question!!!! But to even put him in the same conversation as Tom Brady today is just not intelligent"
Im here for the hurts hate
"Best part of this is 'Chiefs Kingdom' facing the reality of what a mid team they are without getting every call. Between luck and the refs, they should've lost at least 6 games, including Buffalo"
Boring game.
Actual score 40-6!!!
"18:18 no, more like 60 yards."
"the Super Eagles have destroyed, dismantled, demolished, rolled the KC. What a powerhouse. One wonder how the KC got to the Super Bowl.. referees intervention perhaps? Eagles defence turn Mahomes into a ""sack"" of potatoes! What a game from the Eagles. Well done!"
"Now that Our Lord and Savior Patrick Mahomes has been brought down to earth, let's keep him here."
They knew we were onto them...
"Eagles are like the Avatar, they come back when the world needed them most"
That D was insane .
"Mahomes and LeBron, the self-proclaimed GOATs of their sport. Yet in reality, theyre like tiny worms squirming under the massive boulders placed by the real legends, Brady and Jordan, the undisputed GOATs. MaFraud's chokejob is reminiscent of 2011 LeFraud, where he fumbled under the spotlight and averaged 17 points in that Finals. Meanwhile, Brady and Jordan never let themselves become punchlines, they wrote the book on clutch moments instead."
Spotlight was on the refs too brightly for them to steal this one.
"I said it Kansas city is the luckiest team ever, no more 3pts or 1 score wins, you got whopped"
"The Eagles won the game, but lets be honest, we all won tonight"
"Milton Williams getting the sack, forced fumble, and fumble recovery on a single play was chef's kiss."
Seems the Chiefs really ain't Sh*t without the Refs bailing them out lol
uh NFL thumbnail says 2024
When runners high doesn't kick in til the runs almost over
The ref almost lost his life by #58
Destroyed!
@ 14:13 Mahomes throws the ball forward after passing the LoS. They wouldn't have even scored without being blind to that.
I said it alllll season long we would be Super Bowl Champions & look at my Eagles Super Bowl Champions
I wonder how many people got screwed in a block pool on KC 'S last TD and two pointer.
"Wow, this was an embarrassing performance from the chiefs i knew chiefs were in for a riygh night when i checked the score on google, and it was 24 to nothing in favor of the eagles congrats to the eagles they are truly one of the best they beat tom brady and Patrick mahomes this is karma from when they met 2 years ago well deserved and congrats to the eagles wow i don't think oatrick mahomes will get in a super bowl again for a while after this performance eagles are truly great for not only stopping the three peat twice now but alos beating two of the best teams and quarterbacks to ever do this congrats to egals"
Here for the HISTORY! E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!
America was saved today
"Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles for exposing Kansas City for not being who people think they are , these ref's have now been exposed , truly earned Superbowl !"
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
"The 2018 win felt more lively, but WOW PHILLY WHAT A WIN!"
The Eagles remembered very well that game winning field goal from the last time they played Kansas City and this year they held them scoreless for 3 quarters. Insane work.
Mahomes played like he is QB of eagles team
"Sad my Lions didn't make it, but satisfied with the Eagles decimating the KC Cheats"
Lmfaoooo chief fans seeing what happens when refs are actually not helping them score
Tom Brady wanted Kansas To win so bad.He Kept Saying Encouraging Things even when MaHomes knew it was Over for him.
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Eagles stomped the top team in the AFC as well as the officials. Watching Mahomes get thrown to the turf over and over again was the pinnacle.
It probably wouldn't have mattered... but the Chiefs not using Worthy until the 2nd half was VERY DUMB!
This is Kermit Legacy
'Na spremuta de sanguE-e!!!!!
THE EAGLES HAVE LANDED!
"Nice win eagles, a great game on both sides of the ball! Deserved 2025 champs and congrats Hurts on getting that deserved mvp! flying high"
Jawaan taylor finally getting called on his crazy holds
"Those two ref calls in the first quarter; 1 on Philly, 1 on chiefs. Then refs must have been told to allow the teams to play. This was a fair game, and phiily Dline were the MVP"
Kendrick Lamar was poor performance ever. Couldnt understand one freaking word he was trying to sing or say. Pathetic
America is once again united and happy to see the Chiefs lose. Proud of the Eagles!
Thank you Eagles for dominating the Chiefs. The Eagles are too strong in the trenches.
"We took down another dynasty to win the Superbowl It was an absolute blowout Jalen Hurts balled out and only made 1 bad play which was a pick that didn't even hurt us that much as they had terrible foeld position with it The defense played lights out with constant 3 and outs, holding to 6, and Cooper Dejean getting a pick 6 aswell as an absolutely INSANE pass rush The 3 peat stays in No-man's-land for another 2 years"
Chiefs destroyed love it great ending
"""chiefs to look into using three peat,"" ""Fangio is 0-8 vs chiefs,"" ""Saquon carries the eagles,"" ""Jalen hurts can't throw,"" ""make Hurts beat you."" They slept on the Eagles, talking about Hurts like he's some scrub. Chiefs sold out to stop Saquon, Hurts carved them up every which way in this epic beat down"
I can't be more satisfied unless it were the Bills winning
Spanked that ahh boy. Quit playing with us!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COOP
It shows how hard it is to win 3 in a row w. NFL parity. Kudos to N.E. for barely falling short before.
Chiefs suspect offense showed its true colors against a superior defense
The fact that my JAGS put up a better fight against the Eagles is diabolical!
"For everyone thanking the EAGLES on the win, please note that Philadelphia was the 1st capital of our great Republic! And for that and many other reasons, this team will always come and save the Republic! First time from Patriots and this time from Chiefs! #Stopping3peats!!"
we really like that birds
The refs talk is exhausted yall get new content say new things stop whining
Kinda looks like Friga vs Nas TNC anyone? Lol
Worst superbowl i ever saw.
This was a route! Thats what happens when the refs carry you to the Super Bowl. Thank God we dont have to hear about Mahomes for the next year!
I was honestly expecting a crazy Chiefs script comeback in the second half and pull off the 3-peat lol
"Refs tried hard to keep the Chiefs in it until they started getting blown out, good riddance."
"On behalf of everyone over at Raider Nation, Thank you Philly"
Unlike Majority Of People Going for The EAGLES To Win & I'm not Speaking about the Philadelphia Eagles Fans.I am Speaking for the People that Wanted to Watch the Game. I went For them because They Were the Better Team Overall not because I didn't want Kansas to win 3 In a Row.
13:25 That is one impressive throw. Insanely accurate
That Philly d line is filthy....
Kermit is the Goat... Gayest Of All Time....
Ahh Kermit sad
"Well, Kansas City, you showed up..."
as a patriots fan thank you eagles.
Has to be the probably the worst Super Bowl of all time.
"I was going to boycott the Super Bowl but got hungry and went upstairs to get my wings and there on the TV I saw the EAGLES save my love in Football again, I am a lifelong 49er fan and will always be, but I do have to say thank you to the Eagles much respect ."
"The fix is in they said...the refs are KC's they said. Jalen said after losing never again, and the defense destroyed KC. You got one, we got one...see you for number 3"
Wow... Like this game was virtually over in the third... Just can't believe how dominant Philly was... Not a fan of either but I really like watching the Superbowl or at least the highlights.. Totally unexpected..I thought Kansas was going to walk away with the threepeat
"As a Ravens fan, thank you Eagles. That was an onslaught"
"Mahomes might have been a great quarterback at one time . . . but for the last two or three years nobody in our fantasy football league wanted him. He is just another late round . . . worthless . . . pick !!! Without the referees bailing him out all of time . . . the ""Great Mahomie"" looks just like another has - been ""loser"" !!!"
Vic Fangio is LEGENDARY in New Orleans (Dome Patrol) and in general. I'm not surprised that he was able to put the Chiefs in the the sunken place like that. Congrats to that defense.
"That OPI was crazy tootoo play the devils advocate, Barkley was wide open on the check down for an easy first down"
Why they dont show Taylor swift crying
Brady is soooooo terrible
the Chiefs were given a spanking
New score bug is terrible
The Eagles defense reminds me of the Seahawks bullying the Broncos in the SB
Thank you Philly
Great job to the eagles for delivering on the mandate from the American people! Sending an emphatic message to goodell that the last 4 years have been UNACCEPTABLE! Way to do it for the sake of America!
"Sehr schn, fck Chiefs !"
Kiss by KARMA
End of chiefs era. Their Warriors KD run was good but its over.
"Sorry, Carson But, EAGLES ON TOP!!!!"
New champions
worst Super Bowl ever felt like preseason game. week 1
"With the P.O.T.U.S. in attendance, there was extra pressure on the Eagles to win and stay healthy. P.O.T.U.S. hates ill eagles."
It would be better if the Bills were in the Super Bowl.
The BEST part of this super bowl was watching Mahomes get sacked by his own O line LOOOOOOOL
The best team one and Kansas see you in 15 years
Come on Ya'll know why the Eagles won. Here's a full list of former Georgia players who will be competing in Super Bowl 59: Eagles DT Jalen Carter. Eagles DT Jordan Davis. Eagles OLB Nolan Smith Jr. Eagles CB Kelee Ringo. Eagles DB Lewis Cine. Eagles LB Nakobe Dean (injured) Go DAWGS!!! LOL
Crazy how bad the Chiefs look when the officials aren't cheating for them!
13:00 OMG!!!!!!
"Was expecting a back and forth game. Look like Chiefs playbook got read so well, they couldn't move the ball at all. Like what they say no team has 3 peat, not even the great chiefs, they'll be back again next year."
Up 34 to 0 in the third quarter against the Chiefs in a Super Bowl ? .....
after that early offensive pass interference call I was just expecting the same old nonsense
The all mighting chiefs have fallen
"I was this-close from no longer watching NFL due to Rigged/Corrupt Refs which takes the fun out of football. BUT THE DISPLAY I SEEN IN THIS GAME THEY LET BOTH SIDES PLAY FAIRLY, AND FULL PERFORMANCE UNLEASHED. EAGLES DOMINATED IS GAME FOR SURE. A well deserved Win Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Champions 2025!!"
"I'd make a comment, but Tom Brady probably won't like it."
Congratulations
Taylor dated one of Chiefs players but a team from her home state won the super bowl instead
Trumps Aura negated the Taylor illimunati Devil black magic.
"This is what happens when the refs push a team to the Superbowl, and they have no business being there. Bills or Ravens would've been a great game, this was embarrassing"
Overrated Chiefs got exposed. Bills or Ravens would have been better
THERE WILL BE NO THREE-PEAT
"""3 peat this!"" -Jalen Hurts Probrably"
"The Eagles played Tampa 2 nearly all night , rush 4, 2 linebackers and 5 DB's. The only way to get the Eagles out of that formation is to run them out it. The Chiefs didn't really try that. Eagles used the Bucs playbook from SB 55 and stomped the Chiefs. Congrats to the Eagles!"
Liberal QBs all lozers
Can we agree that the CHEIFS and Mahomes was off
Rigged
"Only 3 QBs have beaten Patrick Mahomes in the postseason: Tom Brady, Joe Burrow, and now Jalen Hurts."
Football is a sport!! Can't rig being better!!!
The Eagles Defense was MVP of SB 100%
There wasn't any ref help. The Eagles dominated the trenches. That's it.
finally eagles
"This is the Best Superbowl auf History mit Good, Fun and Feeling Vs Chiefs"
THE CHAMPS ARE YOUNG BE SCARED
cuckage
Man! Im so glad Devonte Smith got the thumb nail. keep going bro!! got that ring!
If Tom Brady is in the building the chiefs cant win in the playoffs.
"Winning 3 straight Super Bowls is the most difficult thing to accomplish in American team sports. Even the all-time greats (Steelers, Cowboys, 49ers, Patriots and Packers) couldn't do it. Still, respect to the Chiefs for a great run."
THERE WILL BE NO THREE-PEAT
The score was brought to you by Fortnite
Feels bad ahahahahaha we dont listen to the script
Over the moon! The Eagles have landed!
"At the start of the year I compared hurts to dak and said the eagles were overrated and werent a good team, boy was I wrong ."
That dhop td won me 3000 hahah
These MF ing refs are getting paid under the table. They should be jail for being corrupted. And karma finally arrived on KC
Go eagles go
SO PROUD TO BE A BIRDS FAN
chiefs offensive line was absolutely terrible
I dont support the chiefs but I dont remember chiefs fans saying anything about the eagles when they won. It seems to me yall are just mad he wins all the time
Nick Wright is going to be beside himself tomorrow! lol
Looks more like a game in Africa
The was one of the most one sided football games I've ever seen. Complete domination from the Eagles. GO BIRDS!!!!!
Chiefs kingdom
the MVP should be the Eagles DL
Dominance.
"Two aful calls one offensive on brown, the OTHER called on one mcduffe. refess stay out the game"
OWNED
AJ Brown reminds me of Michael Irving
Chiefs ran basically into a brick wall and got punched in a face. Phenomenal performance by Eagles defense.
"When the giants smashed the patriots Oline , Brady never got blowout he just took the hits to make the throws, funny how people called him soft, when you Oline is breaking down so much you can't just roll out you have to just time your throw and take the hit."
Im glad the good guys won
Refs had a good season for sure but in the end they came up just short of that 3-peat
"The entire Chiefs' OL will need to look for another team next season. Frankly, this game reminded me of the Seahawks Vs Broncos and Patriots Vs Giants II where the losing team's OL flat-out sucked the entire game."
Ehh. KC dynasty forever probably. I said they got flu. Looked sluggish.
29 minute video of pure dominance. XD
What's it going to be like at the Kelce residence at the next family gathering? Jason retires just short of a Super Bowl win and Travis and the Chiefs blow it in a possible 3-peat. Let the bickering commence.
*The best team won **#MellDuney616** - MELL DUNEY 616*
GO BIRDS
Bye bye Taylor swift. We dont need or want you!
"Jake Elliott was perfect on all his field goals today too, its good to see him succeed after his regular season struggles, i know he's a talented kicker"
WHAT A NIGHT WHAT A GAME GO EAGLES ILL NEVER FORGET THIS GREAT SUPER BOWL GAME UNBELIEVABLE
choketrick mahomes
D Hop really thought he was winning any easy Super Bowls with the Chiefs
"Cry Swifties, CRY!"
Philly destroyed the KC chiefs. Chiefs completely flat
It looks like the Refs were afraid to get fired this time.
These are supposed to be two best teams?! That is so embarrassing!
Chiefs reign is over bolt up AFC West
Glazing KC when they are down 20+ points is crazy
THE HALFTIME PERFORMANCE WAS BETTER THAN THE CHIEFS PERFORMANCE
"As a steelers fan, i had hope that kenny pickett was going to take the final knee to win a super bowl. I did not have him taking a knee for the eagles to win over the chiefs in a blowout to the point the 2nd string guys got playing time in the super bowl not due to injury on my bingo card."
HELL YEAH EAGLES i love tx but i was really rooting for the eagles this time around. i rooted for chiefs last time they faced off in the sb.
Eagles up 17-0 and the announcer says... they really haven't been able to do much against this Chief Defense...
Ben voyons !!! Arranger avec le gars des vues :(
I never want to hear Patrick Mahomes is the Goat again!!!!
"I am so glad that eagles kick but, now KC and kelce, Taylor swift can go to their honeymoon on behalf of NfL and the zebras extra money they got for the call they favor KC last 2 years, not that they needed but now they can enjoy, babaruskiiiii see you in September"
Mahomes got mahowned. Love to see it.
#35 on the chiefs was getting picked on lol
"2.25 2nd ""Unnecessary roughness"" haha all roughness is necessary"
"Jaden puts Mahomes in the ""Hurts"" locker. Better luck next season, Chiefs. ( Hope this time it'll be Detroit Lions' opportunity for real. )"
AND JALEN HURTS CANT THROW THE ROCK?!
Fly eagles fly
Thank you Eagles for saving us from another Taylor Swift obnoxious moment!
I'll be completely honest I loved every single second of this game I didn't expect a blowout though
KC did a good job in shutting down Saquon Barkley though this game. That Eagles defense absolutely destroyed the Chiefs though.
Good game
Eagles defense had an all time great performance. Completely dominated all game. KCs oline had no answers lol.
I still maintain that Hurts is a system quarterback. The D won this game and deserve a steak dinner
Ahhaaha mahomes doesn't know what to do when the refs aren't his O line
LOVED IT!!!!
"The Chiefs remind me so much of the 2014 FSU football team. Never looked all that impressive and won more games than they should have, only to get absolutely smoked by a competent team that wasnt interested in beating themselves."
I came here to see Taylor Swift and did not get disappointed
Eagles fly solo baby
Kermit will never be the zGoat and the cheating chefs lost
The Chiefs scored 30+ points ONCE all season
EAGLES SAVED AMERICA
"My Eagles did it!!!!! Feel bad for Mahomes. Would have loved to see him make history. So either outcome, I would have been fine with."
Pipe was laid tonight
As a cowboys fan thank you eagles. I hate saying it. But THANK YOU!!!!!
Watching this game. It is time for Travis Kelcey to retire and chiefs to invest in a A1 receiver
"When you looked at the eagles on the side line, you could tell how poised they were and a look of confidence throughout the game! You could see it in how they played tonight! They were most definitely the better team! Thats what an actual championship team looks like! Its so satisfying to watch the chiefs get destroyed!! They looked defeated in the first quarter and what happened to poor Travis Kelce? Too much of the swift on his mind. And lets all be honest here, the chiefs absolutely did not deserve to be here tonight!"
"Without the refs, this was embarrassing"
mahomes was playing like matrash
Another 15 win team bites the dust.
I usually don't like blowouts but for the chiefs and taylor swift I'll make an exception.
No match. Dominated
NO MORE TAYLOR SWIFT......THANK GOD......NOW THAT KELCE IS A LOSER AGAIN HE WILL BE SHOWN THE DOOR BY THE CHILDLESS CAT LADY......ROFL
"So that future generations are aware, Patrick Mahomes demonstrated his GOAT status by producing a passer rating of 10.7 at halftime."
"Somebody fire Brady... Somebody tell him to shut up. As a football player he was great but as a commentator he is the worst, the stupidest, the most gawdawful commentator in the history of the NFL."
Absolute destruction. The Chiefs dynasty is over.
"Goat killers, Tom Brady , Patrick mahomes, who we hunting next"
"I've no problem with a Philly win, but did KC throw this game?"
Im an eagles and im just ecstatic. But can we all just take a second to admire that last TD throw from mahomes? 65+ in the air. Absolute majestic bomb.
Kendrick and The Eagles both decided to dance on graves tonight! RIP to Drake and KC
Now we need the rubber match
Its Trumps fault
Nfl deserves a lame game as this for getting a team to the superbowl that wasnt supposed to even be there
This is what happens when refs don't root for your side. Congrats eagles!
Ill be the first to tell you that I dont know anything about football but I have lived in Philadelphia since 2007 and I am so proud that the Eagles beat the Chiefs.
Hoping the Chiefs get embarrassed while also hoping the Eagles choke... at least the Chiefs got embarrassed.
"Anyone who says ""Chiefs were better this game"" or ""Chiefs deserved to win this Super Bowl"" Is a fool. Because no they did not. Eagles were way better."
Eagles eagles you sik demented shyttles
Come to Beikta
"14 mins in the second quarter, down 24-0 and you FINALLY get the ball to Xavier Worthy and whaddya know something good happnes"
You can tell the chief pride was crushed tonight
EAGLES ARE NOW OFFICALLY THE GOATSLAYERS
Redskins put up a better fight than the chiefs two weeks ago.
Mahomes has always been average in SBs he just benefited the other QBs were Jimmy G and Purdy
"Chiefs definitely gave up, you need a leader to step up in those moments like Brady did against the falcons keeping the team together and giving life to their players. Mahomes crumbled just like the O line. Makes me wonder what the bills wouldve done in this superbowl that wouldve been a good showdown."
"As a Cowboys fan. Congratulations to the Eagles. A smart, well run organization with one hell of a badass team! Fly Eagles Fly"
As a mega Chiefs fan congrats Philly. They played an amazing game and put together a masterclass on pass rushing today we had no answer
Never ever compare pat to Brady again
They had to change the script. Too many ppl were catching on.
"Ye, how does it feel now kc fans when the refs aren't on ur side"
Can you bet on how many times Brady mentions himself or his Pats? I wouldve taken the over. And Im a Pats fan.
Favorite play was strip sack fumble-rooskie with icing being the patty-cake to Mahomes face.
See you in September.
Mahomes always losses to Brady in PLayoffs ... then losses again when Bradys a comentator ...
This is a clowns sport
"This was the worst super bowl ever. The game was somewhat boring, the commercials sucked, and the half time show DEFINITELY sucked. Plus all the woke BS commercials sucked. 2 thumbs down for the NFL admin. Chiefs fan, but congrats to Philly, they deserved it."
"I know y'all thief fans are upset tonight, they must not have offered the officials enough money this time. Why didn't someone tell them their is no 3peating in the NFL, I know a lot of y'all are crying like Mahomie was at the end of the game"
That felt good. Sorry Kelce maybe next time.
CHEATING CHIEFS GOT EXPOSED LMAOOOO
53 man vs 53 man the eagles had the better team.
A hate-watch for the ages
As a lifelong Pats fan and Brady my sports hero thank you Eagles Makes SB 52 sting a bit less Mahomes gets blown out by 40 total points in his two Ls Brady lost 3 by a combined 15 points
not having the same ref crew from SB 54 and 58 was key. the refs did a good job on this superbowl.
Xavier worthy
FLY EAGLES FLY
"This is what happens when you are an overrated team that barely won a good portion of their regular season games and wasn't able to get help from the refs in the Super Bowl because the other team was just that good. Not even the refs could overcome the Eagles today. I've always thought the Eagles has a much better well rounded team than the Chiefs. The Eagles don't just barely win their games either. This was an easy pick, though I didn't expect it to be a blowout. That was embarrassing."
Brings me back too the broncos seahawks SB
A famous quote Three in a row wont happen. No ones ever done it & it wont happen now.
"Always fun to see the Chiefs get spanked, especially at the Super Bowl...well done Eagles, well done :)"
What a start for rookie Cooper DeJeanCongrats Eagles
yeah eagles
85 Bears still the best team in NFL history.
Woooooohoooooooooo!!
Philadelphia Eagles Redemption and the chief you have no line and I need more younger receivers. Congratulations Eagles Super Bowl champs
The eagles did 3peat tonight They beat: Andy walrus Reid Mahomelees Taylor swift and the woke movement
What happened Travis where is your little girlfriend?
How come Travis kelce didn't propose to Taylor swift on the 50 yard line hahahaha hahahaha and she was wearing white lol lol hahahaha Hahahaha lol
Worst halftime show ever
Mahomes has always been average in SBs he just benefited the other QBs were Jimmy G and Purdy
The greatest KO by someone from Philly since Rocky Balboa
thank you philli!!! From a bills fan ! Congrats
Can we mention btw how Jake Elliot was kicking MISSILES tonight???? That 50 yarder looked like it wouldve been good from 70
dont let the score fool you this was an annihilation...
The chiefs thought they gonna win with those cheating refs luckily they got fired
Fly eagles fly
I mean if they are going to turn the ball over like that and get a few gift calls too yeah... 24-0 will happen
Biggest CHOKE job in Superbowl history by Mahomes and the NFL Chiefs :) Best sports story of the year!
just for the second time?
Mahomes was PAST the line of scrimmage when he flicked it to Travis Kelsey (14:10)! Total BS.
Not an Eagle's fan but am glad the Chiefs got beat.
When refs collectively decide theyre not going to help your team anymore.. This is the result.
Amazing what can be accomplished when the refs are semi-competent and not clearly in the tank for one team.
"My takeaway is this We are doomed. The Eagles won and everyone is praising God for their victory. Its like the Roman Coliseum. Its sickening to think that these people genuinely believe that God cares about football, especially knowing about the Palestinian genocide. The billionaire oligarchy has warped the minds of the masses. God is their weapon."
Hurtz the MVP king and thank you giants happy birthday to Saquon Barkley and Cooper Dejuan
It was reported 20 min ago that Taylor Swift broke up with Travis Kelce during the Kendrick Lamar halftime show....
"When its a FAIR game , the best rise to the top ."
"Mahomes, Was supposed to be easy !"
"Should have been Bills vs Eagles, you dumb NFL"
"Every AFC fans, besides Chiefs fans, cheered for the Eagles. Good job Eagles"
Pachoke Mahomes lol
Running QBs are nothing but glorified running backs.
Brady sounds boring calling the game Romo would be more exciting
"Hurts better start getting the credit he deserves. Super Bowl MVP before Jackson, Allen, Burrow, Herbert"
I am looking to understand this game? Touchdowns are like goals in football (soccer you call it) or tries in rugby but why are they celebrating things that doesn't matter
Did the Chiefs run the ball at all today?? Reid sweats Mahomes... Beginning to an End of a what was the smallest dynasty
"The refs at this Super Bowl were sick and tired of chiefs winning all the time, a change needed to be done, well done eagles."
"Don't let the score fool you, it wasn't that close."
"Congrats to Saquon, he earned it"
Chiefs are cooked. Revenge is sweet.
*HEY CHIEFS?* CHEATERS NEVER PROSPER
giants vs Brady denver vs Cam eagles vs Pat pressure on the qb is the most important thing! they felt bad they let pat throw the ball pass the line of scrimmage. only reason they scored against the starters
Eagles dominated the chiefs the WHOLE game. Chiefs stood no chance of winning this.
"Andy Reid...that's why you get pal, for throwing the game against Denver to keep Cincinnati out of the playoffs !!"
America's win y'all
Might be the worst game hes played since JV in high school
Get rid of that scoreboard
"Philadelphia mayor *still* can't spell ""Eagles""! Congrats, Eagles. You guys came to play."
"Lehommes"" no 3 peat"
Its safe to say thats the last time I watch a SuperBowl game. 30 seconds of game time followed by 5 minutes of commercials. The game is played out and not worth my time. Good riddance!
eagles exposed this team for the fraud that they are. a team that wins most there games through penalitys shouldnt have been in the super bowl to begin with. thank you eagles for exposing them
i think its jackson Mahomes playing
thank you patrick mahomes the best quarterback eagles ever had
Notice how this is the only game where they show the penalties? They trying to erase the narrative but we all know Chiefs got carried last 3 years
My Packers are still the only ones to have three peated
Even the refs couldn't stop this whoopin.
Was Mahomes drunk?
"The ""wow"" after Smith caught the deep ball was said by pretty much every person watching with interest."
Salute to the esgsles
Mark Andrews I blame You we had to witness this B.S
It's a known fact that it's all planned out ahead of time who the winner will be. It's ALL sports now-a-days. Don't watch none of them anymore.
"Mahomes is one of the most overrated athletes of all time and he handled Philly's 4 man rush as poorly as a QB possibly can. Thakfully Philly putting the backups in makes it look more respectable than it really was, but they basically lost 40-6 when it mattered. Mahomes isn't a top 5 QB."
Favorite moment during the game was when the fans Booed Taylor.
Isnt Julio Jones technically an Eagle? He's won a SB at least lol. Can't even remember the last time he ever caught a pass.
Kelsey made a mistake retiring last year.
Taylor swit got booed Who cares about the Game
Both QB'S are good sports because what it comes down too is it's just a game. New season now. The eagles were the best team this year with a healthy QB.
See what happens when the refs arent allowed to help you
Still some questionable calls for the Chiefs but they were way behind on the scoreboard and had to force plays. Eagle's defense won this game. Kermit was running for his life. Was hit sacked and was in panic mode. Love it. Trying to make history and failing in grand fashion. Actually glad Buffalo didn't make it to the Superbowl. This Eagle's team is very good. Hopefully we will get Buffalo vs Philadelphia next for the Superbowl. Go Buffalo
"""mahomes has won more Superbowls than brady in his first 7 years""... Yeah and he's also lost more"
America's team should now be the Eagles instead of Cowboys
KC..did not see the freight train coming all day
The Eagles whooped the Chiefs so badly at the Superbowl lol
It's surreal to see Jalen Hurts win a ring before the QB that took his job and had him benched in the National Title game years ago. Congrats to him on turning it around. Wow
Hurts is better than Mahomes.
As a chief fan ggz
Thank you Taylor!!
Can we agree that the officiating AGAINST the Chiefs was ALSO horrible. Two things may be true.
"Chiefs got exposed, this is who they were all season but thanks to the refs it was all covered up to make them look good. Im not sure if they shouldve gotten this far tbh"
"Haven't seen one ""fire Nick"" comment...."
CHIEFS FANS WHAT HAPPENED
Mahomes was pass the line of scrimmage on that shuffle pass smh
Mahomes needed this
"That was ""The Maulin' in New Awlins, Y'all!"" Copyright 2025 by Arthur Danu"
Mahomes was pass the line of scrimmage on that shuffle pass smh
That was a good hit
Mahomes--50 yard guided missile touchdown! The loss was not his fault.
"There were several winners in this game. The Eagles (obviously), the NFL, the fans of the sport, and TB12. Leave it to TB12 to show what he can do in the SuperBowl lol"
GO BIRDS THIS ONE DOESNT EVEN FEEL REAL WHAT A SEASON THIS ONE IS SO SPECIAL
"Happy birthday, Cooper and Barkley!"
Eagles got revenge on the chiefs for defeating them two years ago! And I loved watching it.
Kenny Pickett is a Super Bowl champion in his second season
"If the Commanders had to give up their Native American style ... will the Kansas City Chiefs ever have to sacrifice name or logo? Ask yourself this: If there was a new franchise coming onto the NFL, would they allow it to be called Chiefs, WITH a clear Native American icon as the logo? No. They would not. Why? Because the combo stinks of low wit, white privilege ignorance. And that was A-OK in the 1960s ... but less-so now."
EAGLES OBLITERATED CHIEFS IT WAS NEVER A GAME
To everyone saying the refs didnt help or the script was revealed bla bla bla. This is what the NFL wants you to think. So everyone and their mothers bet on KC to win - then Vegas and the leagues suits make $ betting on Philly to win
Exposed. Didn't deserve to be in the superbowl to begin with. Can't wait to enjoy the tears of chiefs fans for the next year.
"Games with names: I shall name this game the ""flip the script"" super bowl."
"CONGRATS, EAGLES, ON DESTROYING THE CHEATED-FOR-CHIEFS."
Absolutely love this team so proud of theses guys man and where we have came this team came off strong together and they were ready too play all week ## Super Bowl champs baby !! Lets Goo!!
Kansas City CHEATS got exposed bums
Best redemption story ever love it
"Brady won multiple super bowls scoring 1 offensive touchdown.. If you think Tom Brady is the goat, that's fine, but you're essentially saying Hurts is better than Josh Allen Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow. I.e. Congrats, you told on yourself"
Finally no more Taylor Swift highlights!!! Thank you Eagles
"Ngl i feel glad them eagles won and i bet most people will agree , we where getting tired of them chiefs and there refs helping them"
Gotta hear eagles fans talk all year
As a diehard Bengals fan I couldnt be happier to watch the eagles just completely destroy the chiefs 2025 has started out to be an amazing year
Woah
Breh the media and the haters got into mahomes head.. talkn bout refs and shidd . Mofaka loss his A game. The eagles definitely deserved to win that.
Thank you Eagles
All the eagles doubters better put respect on this team we earned
"As a Rams/Raiders fan, this was the most satisfying game all year. Thanks Eagles for hammering em!"
Thank the good Lord for the Eagles !!!! Great 2 c KC get beat down tonight. Go Raiders!!!!!! FCK KC!!!!!
Congratulations Eagles from Chiefs fan in KC. Eagles D reminded me of the old Tampa Bucs and Ravens SB defenses from 20+ yrs ago. Great defense still wins championships and Eagles came to play. Hats off.
MA BUMs Couldn't get it together.
I dont want to hear anything about Mahomes for a while. Mahomes is average he just been blessed with a great team. He is not on Lamar Jacksons level when it comes to skill set.
This was one of the shittiest nfl seasons ever..
IDK if this is the new scoreboard
World Champions!! See you on Broad Street.
"No Superbowl Halftime Show Is Touching Queen Bey 2013 when the show was bigger and better than the actual game. The Aja Wilson Nike Ad empowering and slaps. Making a basketball jersey a red carpet dress impressive drip. Felicitations To Philly winning their 2nd Ring. Their defense astounding. Chiefs took the final quarter to be themselves. This rivalry will go for a few years. Rematch coming next Superbowl. Hurts is the 2nd best Quarterback in the league. For allen, jackson, burrow sit down until you can handle pressure lads."
Chiefs lost cuz the checks they made to the refs bounced
"16:44 no, the refs did not play with them and showed Kansas City to be the mediocre team they are"
Tom Brady will always be the greatest and it's not even close. NFL tried hard to elevate Mahomes but couldn't do it.
"Thank goodness, the last thing we needed was another championship win for the Kansas City Taylors."
FLY EAGLES FLY!
where are all the zebras.... making all the call for KC? lol
"Lifelong Chiefs fan here. Congratulations Philadelphia. Y'all played a great game, dominated on both sides of the ball. Hard for us to watch here in Kansas City but we'll always be proud of guys."
"Chiefs went an entire half, and fourteen more minutes in the third quarter, without scoring any points."
"Mahomes in his 2 Super Bowl losses 527 yards 3 TDs 1 with backups in for Eagles 6 Turnovers total 9 sacks AFC teams better pay attention, NFC has shown two different times now what kind of defense you need to dominate the Chiefs"
Where are all the people claiming the NFL is fixed/rigged? And no I'm not a KC fan.
Chiefs got a huge spanking. Just couldn't make it happen. They are still my favorite team and will always be champions to me. Go Chiefs!
13:01 that touchdown was awesome
Here I thought chiefs were suppose to be the best
"Now that the Eagles have broken KCs dynasty and given the rest of the NFL the blue print to make Mahomes look like an avg QB, I hope we are done seeing his stupid commercials all over TV once and for all."
EAGLES DOMINATED CHIEFS GAME WAS OVER IN FIRST HALF
13:03 was insane!
I dedicate this game to Nick Wright!!!!!!
"These announcers are flaming mediocrities, no?"
Although edp445 never got his cupcake at least he got an eagles Super Bowl win
The Chiefs are an ABSOLTE DISGRACE!!!
kc's d coordinator should probably be fired
"This superbowl was so smooth. They didn't show to many celebrities, no over the top commercials, laid-back halftime show, not a lot of drama, and the most docile qb ever gets his redemption. Congrats, eagles!!!"
Man eagles dominated. Chiefs looked tired after the third drive. Hurts is officially elite and the media will never give him his props. Congrats eagles fans yall deserved this Super Bowl!!!
I'm just glad Taylor Swift didn't win.
As a chiefs fan. Having 3 super bowls in the last 6 years smells so good still.
So much joy seeing Mahomes get pressured like he got pressured today
The first game all year the cheifs didn't have the refs. Ya there sure good at football
"Howie Roseman the best GM in the league and overall in Eagles history! He phenomenally built and rebuilt the team, especially the defense, after the disaster of last season, which completely fell apart in the second phase of the 2023 season! Howie Roseman masterclass!"
"Wheres all the mahome boys at??? Better than Brady??? Blown out in Super Bowl twice??? Insane!! Dont ever compare the two again. Chiefs have been frauds for a long time and this just proved it. No controversy here. Chiefs were more experienced, had the refs and everyone for them. Healthy team and all Cant be cocky anymore! Adios ! Another NFC EAST team ruining a dynasty"
Go birds ! Put some respect on my QB#1s name!
"Finally can rest, it felt so good seeing chiefs get humiliated at the biggest stage."
SUPERBOWL EAGLES
"The Philadelphia Eagles Have come A Long Way.... Growing Pains turned this team into a Powerhouse ! If anyone deserves a championship, it's The Eagles!"
More like Super Blown
Boys: This is what football looks like when the refs don't run interference for the Chiefs.
Lets goooo
This is the reason i gave up on the NFL.Superbowl supposed to be the best 2 teams going at it not a blowout.
Good lord the chiefs got destroyed
SF fans.. my birds did what yall couldnt was get out lic back from Mahomes... Yall should take notes
KC today thrashed
The Philadelphia Eagles have saved the NFL. Fly Eagles Fly.
Eagles made America proud
Let go fly eagles fly babe
"Thanks you eagles, the chiefs have finally been stopped, and you stopped history"
There is no greater satisfaction than watching Mahomes get planted on the ground and not getting help from the refs.
This week I guess it will be Nick's Tears!!!!
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!! ON A ROAD TO VICTORY!!!!!
"It was good that there was no historic three peat as the Chiefs pushed games all season and SB fully deservedly goes to the Eagles. The concert play of the ""Eagles"" in every respect and defense completely destroyed the dynasty, which fell before our eyes."
This game was fix. Is very sad. The NFL is part of the corruption
I think everyone was rooting for the Eagles.
The rookie cooper Dijon mustard was all gas
Congrats to the Eagles from Los Angeles Ca.....
911: What's your emergency? Me: Please do a wellness check on Nick Wright because the Eagles trounced the Chiefs to win the Superbowl
He was over the line of scrimmage
This game was giving me Super Bowl LII Eagles and Super Bowl LV Chiefs vibes.
Kept hearing the refs would help the Chiefs.. reality is often more interesting that truth however
The defense was too much. It was a sac party
SO FUNNY READ ALL THE LOSERS FAN TEAMS SUPPORTING THE EAGLES LOL
"I'm a diehard Steelers fan but that throw from Hurts to Smith was one of the greatest NFL daggers I've ever witnessed. Even I had to scream ""LET'S GOOO"""
13:09 what a catch! Devonta Smith. That was incredible.
"For the third time, the Philadelphia Eagles played the defending champions in the Super Bowl, and they are now 2-1 after a very impressive victory! 2004 Patriots L 21-24 (Super Bowl XXXIX) 2017 Patriots W 41-33 (Super Bowl LII) 2024 Chiefs W 40-22 (Super Bowl LIX)"
Glad they stop showing Taylor Swift
To quote the late Pat Summerall: There will be no three peat!
LETS GOOOOOOO EAGLES
BEST DAY OF MY LIFE PT.2
All that luck regular season just to get embarrassed in the super-bowl
NFL rigs every game
13:03 - 13:14 is so satisfying. hurts > smith > referee. smooth.
"man i wish barkley punched one in, but he did workhorse things"
The Mahomobowl didnt pan out.
All those calls that went the Chiefs way ... all those non-calls that went the Chiefs way ... the well dried up. So someone made money betting on the Eagles today.
"Im a giant eagles fan, honestly chiefs did good this season but , not well played chiefs"
Eagles DEFENSE was incredible. O line protected Hurts. Eagles were firing on all cylinders. 2 time SUPERBOWL champions.
"Wow NFL, you flipped the script on everyone! The Chiefs looked average as hell without help from the refs."
"Man, it's like in fair game without the worst turf known to man, the better team wins convincingly. Wild"
Where are all the KC fans
"So the real KC Chiefs were only kk, thanks to the referees"
Chiefs spent so much time game planning for Barkley they forgot about the rest of the Philly offense!
I love Football but that was boring. Soccer world cup running circles around this.
I pray this score bug was a one and done thing for the Super Bowl. Please bring the other one back
This game felt over in the second quarter. Seriously
Who believes kellen Moore will accept the saints job?
WE MADE HISTORY ONCE AGAIN!!!!! ALL THIS SHII PPL TALKED ABOUT EAGLES ARE NOTHING WITHOUT SAQUON BUT GUESS WHAT....WE GOT A.J... WE GOT GOEDERT... WE GOT SMITTY.....WE GOT CALCULATOR....

BAUN.....REED & COOP AKA THE EXCITING WHITES......Q......SLAY......BRADBERRY (sike) CJGJ....JD....JC....BG....OJOMO....AND MORE!!!! LFGGGG
Nick Write!!!! How about them Chiefs lol. I guess the refs couldn't win this game for the Chiefs since so many eyes were on this game? or maybe the refs were just off their game today?
"YES, EAGLES"
He's saying watch the camera as if he actually means something in that moment...
Gee.. wonder what Nick Wright's excuse will be this time??
see what happens when the ref doesnt help? a very deserving team to get absolutely demolished. Mahomes got sacked at least 5 times they rattled him and got him off his game
What happen to the fake goat LMAO
Roll Tide. Jalen to Smith is like old times in Tusculoosa.
Chiefs got hosed
AYE IM BEIN HONEST EAGLES GOT REVENGEE ON CHEIFS 2O22 SB
"Thank god, there is a sport called football (the original one, not the american version)"
"Im not fan of football but glad chiefs lost , theyre like divas"
Nick Wright calling in sick tomorrow.
Cooper DEJEAN robbed of MVP!!!!!! Honestly ANYONE ON THAT DEFENSE COULDVE WON MVP I cant lie
All the Jalen hurts haters are SILENT
"On the backhand flip Mahomes had to Kelce I believe a commentator said what a play. Gimme a break. Mahomes, just like every other QB, is below average when under constant pressure and on their back half the game."
"NFL Figured out we know it was rigged fror KC so they changed the script. We know folks, NFL end is at hand. BA Bye."
made a cool 600$ off this.
Sacked how many times without a ref breath call?! Lmfao !! Fly fly!!!!!
Mahomes playing like an 8 yr old
Proud of the Dawgs playing tonight. They got Natties and a SB now!
The eagles win was for the whole league!
Hey announcers. Nobody cares what you like or dont like
"for chiefs fans out there, how would u rate the game from 40-22??????"
Well the eagles defeated two teams favored by refs the cheatriots and the chiefs. Kudos for Philly
2017
The Eagles were better. And it wasn't even close.
9/11 for Roger Goodell. Mahones exposed lmaoo
Saquan should have broke the record along with getting a ring
Long story short we were the better team on both sides of the ball..all that narrative patrick this patrick that we won in dominant fashion...wont be a three peat nothing kinda like jayden daniels wont be the first rookie nothing..dont let the score fool you should have been like 40-14 but had to stat pad at the end just to make it look presentable but our defense wasnt scared of nothing
Eagles out played the Chiefs!
"Never forget that these mfs bought the ""3 Pete"" patent from Pat Riley, just to get a 40 burger"
Mahomes' wife secretly bet ten grand on the Eagles then weakened his legs pre-game.
The play-action bomb to DeVonta was cold-blooded.
Ever pro football fan and NFL team was rooting for the Eagles for sure .
When the refs don't play the game for you it's crazy what happens to a team that isn't that good.
Now we just need the Eagles to deal with Trusk.
"The NFL decided to not rig another KC game, it was too risky. Congrats to the Eagles."
The Chiefs finally ran into an actual team that can play defense and put points on the board . Thank the refs for calling a fair game.
American mascot: Eagle
"Congrats to Philly, they had it! No shame to the KC Chiefs, their defense did as much as they possibly could; however, Mahomes and the KC offense simply didn't have it against a superior Eagles defense."
Klutch Sports is the biggest winner tonight.
They finally lost and they refs didn't know how to help
Literally the worst super bowl in history. You should be proud...
"I'm a steeler fan and I am the happiest I've ever been.Thank you, eagles.I did not want to see the chiefs woman"
THE EAGLES are the champions Congratulations JALEN HURTS and the entire team....
MAN THEY BEAT US LIKE WE BOUGHT THE LAST PAIR OF BLACK METALLIC 5'S. MAN THEY BEAT US LIKE WE DRINK THE LAST CAN OF BEER XMAS MORNING. I FEEL SORRY FOR WORTHY HE SHOWED UP
Refs did a horrible job rigging the game!
the refs tried to help but the Eagles were too much tonite
I'm already sick of losing
I knew the chiefs luck was going to run out especially when the POS refs call a fair game
This annihilation just adds tons more speculation on the whole year the chiefs had imo. I guess the NFL is an entertainment league afterall. Like the WWE.
its almost like chiefs are not that good and got some help from the refs
OL
Not even close. Eagles r the best team in the nfl. No debate.
Chiefs are not that good without the refs apparently. Philly man handled the chiefs and now are the champs
FLY EAGLES FLY ON THE ROAD TO VICTORY!!
Didn't take our foot off the gas once. Belt to ! GO BIRDS!
All season long the chiefs got breaks and it finally caught up with them
As a bills fan I couldn't be happier..this is what happens when an organization actually puts talent around a good QB..that was a beating ...congrats Philly mob
Patchoke Mahomes!
I cant wait to hear from Nick Wildes tomorrow!!
Philadelphia defense for MVP
Order has been restored
Hurts to Devonte? Are we at Alabama again?
"So I guess the deal was number 15 on the chiefs wasn't allowed to play until the other team hit 30, gotta give him credit for the short time he played he almost brought his team back."
Chiefs have played in 3 consecutive SBs winning 2. Sky isnt falling the rest of the NFL would sell their firstborn for our last 7 years.
Barkley finally won a title... oops not sir Charles Barkley though...
What a year go birds running it back next year
My favorite hate watch
0 blitzes.
I bet Jason K punching air wishing he played one more yr... I wished him and fletch did but at same time this group is young and got major major experience.. my team will be here for long time especially with Howie as GM
"Let's be honest, Chiefs are just an average team this season, the worst team of the final 4 for sure, maybe the worst of final 8. They got so many favorable calls in the regular season to get the 1st seed and bye which they absolutely don't deserve. They have no business to be in the Super Bowl but again aided by refs in both games against Texans and Bills. Without refs, Mahomes got exposed completely in this game and Chiefs got nothing, without Mahomes, Andy Reid is nothing. It's so satisfying to see this fraudulent team get exposed and dismantled so badly in the biggest stage!"
"As a pittsburgh fan, my hatred of philly sports was put on hold for this one. Just glad chiefs didn't win again."
The Eagles have changed the standard of NFL football teams. What a display this was. Im a Vikings fan and Im glad I didnt have to watch the vikes get destroyed by the Eagles post season.
Philly told KC to get it with your hands ninja
Jalen Hurts deserves it after being benched at Alabama over Tua Roll Tide Roll
-Fraud-watch Chiefs get stomped -Taylor Swift gets booed -Kendrick Lamar halftime show Best Super Bowl in a while
"It looked like kc was going to get skunked. But nevertheless, they were beaten badly."
Chiefs blown out again in the Superbowl! the world is finally healing again.
Never compare Mahomes to Brady EVER again
Congratulations Philadelphia !
THANK YOU PHILADELPHIA EAGLES!!!! I couldn't be happier typing these words Yes tired of hearing The Chiefs going to 3 peat going to 3 peat Etc Blah Blah they're so good this and that well hear The Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl Champions with a Dominating Performance I Might Add THANK YOU. I like to hear all the sports shows talk now.
This Eagles win was a win for every NFL fan (who isn't a Chiefs fan lol). Congrats Eagles/Eagles fans!
"Honestly...this team went 15-2 with a 2000 Yard Rusher* The #1 Defense The Best Oline Arguably the best DLine I think you can make a legitimate case to place them in the GOAT Conversation as far as Teams go. Especially after dismantling the current Day Dynasty on the biggest stage. They have to be in the convo with the 13 Seahawks, 85 Bears, 91 Redskins and 84 9ers. I'm not an Eagles fan just someone who has watched the of Football for a long time."
"Sydney Brown, SB Champ!!!"
Eagles clawed the chiefs out of Kansas!
GO BIRDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
FLY Eagles FLY!!!!
Try again next time KC. No 3 peat tonight.
Hurts so good.
So proud to be an eagles fan
Hurts has outplayed mahomes in all 3 of their matchups. Insane the disrespect the media mad non ball knowing fans give him. Thats our franchise qb and hes more than likely better than yours.
The people who were complaining that it's all scripted and that the refs would help the Chiefs win are probably singing a different tune now.
"I watched the whole game, including the halftime show from Kendrick Lamar. So worth it, this was all so amazing to see (except for chiefs fans)."
"Like a good neighbor, no three peat is there"
"mahomo threw a pass beyond the line of scrimmage, it was obviously not called. 14:13"
Balance has been restored to the universe
I like how everyone wanted the chiefs to lose
#Jalinhertz is the the number one. Quarterback
NFL goal was to regain atleast some integrity and get rid of the conspiracies
All the clowns who said a real dual threat qb can't win a Super bowl! One word! DEBUNKED!!!!
a lot of people donated today
"As a bills fan, thank you, Eagles for beating the Kansas City Swifties. My uncle is a huge eagles fan and he was proud that Jalen Hurts got MVP"
So happy we won but nothing will top the 2018 SB victory against the Pats. This dub was just very much needed vengeance. On to the next season
"As a chiefs fan.. all imma say is we will be back.. dont forget it America, we far from done"
Like Mav Levy said I lay down here and bleed a while but we will be back not an exact quote the chief dynasty is fall far from over but the Eagles do deserve this one
"Eagles wanted this game after Arizona and they got it, they went for the neck and never stopped. Being a McNabb fan first before the 39 run and just stayed and cried when they won 52, but angry losing 57 and now winning 59. They wanted this. Go Birds."
Taylor Swift will dump Travis Kelce before I even finish typing this comment.
love it
"Finally I am believing again in the fairness of the NFL , I am a broncos fan , but I will keep an eye on the eagles it's very satisfying to see a defense controlling Mahomes. Congratulations Eagles and the NFL."
"this is what happens when you rig sports , The ravens or bills deserved this game yet were robbed by the pfizer advocates . disgusting money pit."
"As much I dont like the Eagles, I wanted a fair game and thi"
LETS GOOOOO FLY EAGLES FLY
Former Florida State Seminoles DE #19 Josh Sweat had a hell of a game with 2.5 sacks. Go Noles!
some of the best defense ive seen. Well earned win.
Chiefs fan here congratulations on An amazing season eagles you guys played way better than us and deserved this moment.
"WHAT A SEASON, WE DESERVED TO BE CHAMPIONS! FLY EAGLES FLY!"
KANSAS CITY NOT LIKE US!!!!!!
Bro the eagles put back ups in the Super Bowl
OL
"thats what u get, kansas city cheaters. cant beat a good team without the refs helpin ya"
Ravens could never
Cheifs fans tears taste the best
"Thank you eagles. As a ravens fan, you guys forever have my respect."
"Congrats Eagles. The GOAT debate well and truly shut down. Jalen Hurts, well deserved MVP."
CONGRATS PHILLY YOU DESERVE IT!
this is what happens when the chiefs dont have Refball :P
RIGGED
"I guess that the refs didn't get their checks from the Chiefs, this time."
"Congratulations Eagles on be Super Bowl champion. Sadly, the NFL season is over. Until next year guys"
This is full game not highlights
Chiefs vs. Refs America Lost Tonight!
It's almost as if then switching refs made a difference
BuT tHe ReFs!!!
rename this video to Philadelphia eagles super bowl highlights
"Fan of neither team but really happy for Saquon, LOL @ Giants."
Its almost like the Chiefs didnt deserve to be there...
I new the Eagles were going to win they played way better than the cheifs all season
Surprising game
Jalen Hurts the Chiefs! The only acceptable headline for this game.
the chiefs didn't bring their referees this time
"I said it all year, the chiefs were never good. It was just a combination of luck and refs, and I think this game proved my point"
and that's what happens when the refs do their jobs
Mahomes you're not the goat
#Jaylen hurts is the number one quarterback
As a Broncos fan thank you eagles for beating chiefs I believe NFL isnt rigged anymore Enjoy yall moment feels good to be champs a whole year
"I dont know how Kansas City won three Super Bowls, the dumbest Team in the NFL"
"Dang, Dejean gets a pick 6 and a Superbowl ring on his birthday in his rookie year. Nice."
EAGLES WIN
Guess Chiefs didnt get the memo that Refs arent allowed to cheat for them. Goodell and refs job was on the line tonight. Chiefs are average at best if it werent for the refs. This proves the point that all their SB run was tainted and that their SB trophies was bought
All the Taylor Swift fans crying online about the Chiefs losing as if they really care about football
Titan fan here..good job Eagles.
It is good to see mr pfizer and team swifty lose.
"And with that, 31 fan bases were cheering with a shocked look on their faces."
"13:10. Smith scores, tosses the ball to the ref .... stylish grab by Mr Zebra."
13:00 Wow what a middle finger.
Same recipe when Brady and Burrow beat them !!! Broad street bully
"One things for sure, PHILLY EAGLES remembers everything in the past... And that's what is dangerous about meeting a team twice (except the patriots )."
I know the eagles won but man worthy played a great game man if they would have let him cook mabe it would have been different good job eagles im a panther fan so it's nice to see someone else win a chip one day we will keep pounding panthers
The chiefs rain of terror is over. The eagles have now dismantled two dynasties in the last 7 years. The Eagles really are North America's spirit animal.
Fun fact the eagles are only team to stop brady 3 peat and Mahomes 3 peat... We are third most successful franchise in past 25 yrs plus... Put respect on this franchise
This was definitely a Philly Special
Brady would never get blown out

"*Michael Jacksons Billy Jean* Cooper DeJean, is not a safety"

Replay button 15:45
Chiefs offensive line failed Patrick Mahomes today. The Eagles capitalized.
Was it me or did they change the ref? Clearly the chefs werent able to win without them.
"The Eagles offensive and defensive line was the difference. That big and great Eagles offensive line provided good coverage for Hurts to make enough plays against a good Chiefs defensive line, and they sometimes pushed the Chiefs defensive line around. Just 4 guys on the Eagles were able to rush and put pressure on Mahomes all game, they sacked him, hit him, taken the great QB out of rhythm. I was rooting for the Chiefs, but I can admit that the Chiefs stood no chance, lol"
chiefs downfall you love to see it
Eagles champsss babyyy fly eagles flyyy
They don't look too good without the refs help
Great game. Go Eagles!
How about them chiefs
Jalen hurts is the number one quarterback
Thank you Eagles for saving the NFL.
Seeing Mahomes getting lit up in the face in slow motion in 3 different angles starting at the 15:56 mark is sending me
"Texans fan here, thank you Eagles. Justice has served Refs didn't help you this time Chiefs"
That offensive lines from the chiefs they betting for lose mahomes and running and they just walking watching unbelievable and the first two flags changed the game for worse. What a nasty game from the chiefs no energy effort in any moment
We were ALL honorary Eagles fans today
Sad thing is chiefs were still holding on the defensive line like crazy.they have all year
Congratulations eagles!
"When it matter , Mahomes stinkin' out the place"
Defense wins superbowls
My cousin owes me $2000 from this wheres my money
Might be the most satisfying game Ive ever watched. Ive never been so happy to watch a teams downfall like I watched the Chiefs today. Thank you Philly.
They just broke Chiefs and f Mahomes over. This might be the day we finally get rid of Chiefs.
The one game that refs decide to not help the chiefs they get embarrassed. Chiefs did not earn a trip to the Super Bowl and they got exposed.
"Sure, you COULD blame Taylor. But your disaster-prone president was there, too. Rooting for the Chiefs."
6:11 for IMO perhaps the game's biggest play
14:13 are you still able to throw it past the line of scrimmage?
The Bills would have put up a much better fight than this pathetic showing
I can't wait for the so called like nick wright especially all the hate for Jalen hurts I love it
Can mahomes the GOAT narrative please stop now
I don't want to hear from anyone even again say that the NFL is rigged. As much as I hate the chiefs the coaches they have are the best and the eagles have a very talented team
"Brady is happy because if Mahomes won a 3 peat than he would've passed him as the goat, but now the only chance for Mahomes is to win 7 SBs"
That last strip fumble from Mahomes was from all the teams they cheated. Extremely satisfying
All year the Chiefs have been playing football with training wheels the refs took the training wheels off and now look at them haha this reminds me of when he plays Brady or burrow.
HAHA CHIEFS HAHA MAHOMES HAHA KELSE HAHA SWIFTIES HAHA CHIEFS FANS YOU BEEN EXPOSED
"Yes mahomo didnt get 3 peat , but bro this new fox sports scoreboard is just so bad im sorry il not a fan of it"
World champs again baby!! Fly fly
"So it remains, the last time a team won three championships in a row (3-peat) was in 2002, when Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant did it with the Lakers."
I'm kinda glad that Philly won because athletes egos get outta control when you make Gods outta them. I mean you can't turn on the television without seeing KC on some State Farm commercial and Taylor Swift sitting in the owners booth
Hahahahah. Nick Wrong and all these espn picking KC. So quiet . Swifties go home. Refs cant helped yall tonight.
I was watching the Superbowl on my 50 inch TV with the best of the NCF vs AFC while eating KFC rooting fo my KC
This was such a deserved beatdown.
The Eagles just showed no mercy to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs it was an absolute blowout for the Eagles
"no talent swift LOST! hahahahahaha,"
Hurts destroyed Mahomes. He's officially elite
"Im gonna watch these highlights of Mahomes getting sacked, intercepted, and crying about 50 times....And I'm not even an Eagles fan"
These commentators.....rubbish
This eagles team is just the 2021 bucs in green. Hard to find any holes on the team. Drafted well prior and then added several really good players to get them over the edge. Hard to beat a team when they are well coached and legit every player is playing like a pro bowler and could start on a dozen other teams.
This is twice within the span of less than a decade that the Philadelphia Eagles have saved America.
"In order to be the best, you have to beat the best, the Eagles earned it!"
"Fue un fraude , quien sabe del juego se dieron cuenta, y las apuestas fueron a favor"
YES PHILADELPHIA SAVED US
defense still wins championship
Nothing makes me happier than the Cheats getting demolished on the biggest stage.
"I cut the cord about a year ago so I couldn't watch it. I really didn't have a dog in the fight, my Bears are awful. But I really didn't want to see the Chiefs win it again."
Vegas won big tonight because most people bet on the Chiefs.
Won 15 grand
Give them birds a chill pill y'all
the chiefs got dog walked in this game fly eagles fly
"Even in the announce booth, Brady beats Mahomes when it matters. This is definitely some jinx"
Best enjoyable game ever!
Howie roseman is the real MVP bro bin building and making nasty offseason moves for times like this.
Watching the Chiefs absolutely collapse during this game was one of the most satisfying feelings ever.
Reminds me of the Argentina vs France final in world cup 2022
What. they havent been able to do much against this formidable Chiefs defense!! Eagles up 17-0 when Brady said that. The offense had 10 of those points!! Whats he talking about.
"1:38 That throw, though it was like baseball pitch"
Flying high eagles
FOOTBALL HAS BEEN SAVED!!!
Feel sorry for Mahomes. Eagles D is relentless.
EAGLES
"And with that, the 2024 season comes to an end. Good night."
Dear NFL fans from now and on its not bout how much money your QB makes.. its about the team totally.. Howie Roseman put together a beast roster.. football is a team sport.. every gm goal is to build a roster not build QB and tell him to bring it home smh
As a Bills fan it brings me immense joy watching the Chiefs get destroyed in the Super Bowl
The world is healing
RIGGED!! oh wait
Vengeance is Mine. Saith the Eagles
"A number of thoughts. Number one: How does Schoen or ANYONE in the Giants front office or coaching staff still have job? Two: Did Saquon (and Henry, Jacobs, Mixon and the other RBs that got let go of this past off season and had outstanding seasons this year) just resurrect the RB market? Three: TB12 is still the unquestionable, undisputed GOAT. Four: No seriously, how to Daboll and Scheon still have their jobs? How has Mara not flown into a rage at this and fired them on the spot?"
SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS
McHomes is most over-rated QB of overtime (sorry Eli).
Eagles really should have scored 50+ points if not for the refs
"The Eagles exploited the Offensive line of Kansas City, which has been a problem all year long, hence all the close games. KC defense up until tonight has keep them in every game and Mahomes, Kelce and Worthy always made some miracle plays to win but tonight they were out played and out coached. Congrats Philly!!!!"
I thought it was rigged ?
The Philadelphia Eagles saved the NFL and America from the Chiefs 3peat
Eagles beat Brady and Mahomes!
"They can celebrate now, wait till the cheetah comes back to KC"
I am not an eagle fan but congrats to them.
"as a life long kc native, well played Philly, this team will be in the super bowl at least 3 more times in the next 6 years, cant wait for the 2nd rematch"
not even close. kc was revealed as a fraud
"Satan couldnt pull it off in the home of the saints, America is saved"
13:13 such a smooth catch by the ref while also keeping the signal up
Hurts > Mahomes
"Thank you, Eagles."
This was a delicious moment for the world thank you eagles
Just goes to show that the chiefs had no business even being in the playoffs this year.
"Congrats to the Philadelphia eagles for sending the all mighty Kermit the frog home and the fake Taylor swift fans. The season for the first time in two years it ended on a positive note. And man so this is how the game looks when refs dont interfere . FLY EAGLES FLY, dont hear yall anymore fake chiefs fans. Now next stop, San Francisco."
I don't remember seeing Brady getting his back blown out like this in a Super Bowl BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED. Now it happened to Mahomes twice
Feels so good watching the chiefs lose this when they got a gift against my falcons.
They beat the chiefs with four up front and no blitz... yikes. Pat was running around in panic mode
"Unbelievable wow wow wow, amazing the biggest biggest biggest congratulations Philadelphia Eagles no 3 peat so so sick and tired of them got exactly what I wanted lets go lets go lets go !!! Lots and lots of Love from Canada"
Mainly here to read the comments
Your welcome wrold. Lets go birds!!!!
Go Dawgs
"What will Stephen A. be saying now. Mahomes is the GOATstill better than Brady, he is the greatest player of time!!! And heres why,.. and Bradys 10 appearances and 7 championships are still less than my man Patricks 3 victories!"
Hahahahaha the Easgles put a stomping on the Kansas City punks
Whoa they actually called holding on the Chiefs???
i love being from philly
I made a 100 today.. thank u eagles from a 49er fan
"7:20 ... Eagles up by 17... ""they haven't been able to do much against this very tough formidable Chief'ss defense..."" lol what did I just hear???"
"So Taylor swift got booed, Patrick Mahomes got tossed around like a rag doll and the chiefs just got completely dominated. It was a very very good Sunday. Thank you so much Eagles"
As a Broncos fan I say congratulations to the eagles wow I thought we did it to KC but yall did it to em worse
Today I learned being down 34 and scoring is a 2 point conversion situation.
This was utter domination
I think it's safe to say that Saquon Barkley is the Walter Payton of our generation.
Eagles finally win a Super Bowl !!! Chiefs dynasty ends
"Fly, baby, fly! Jalen Hurts, what else can you say?"
The GOAT conversation is gonna have to wait
Hopefully Siriani gets to keep his job next year
Eagals put BTA
Go birds.
Why didnt Travis Kelce play today?
LETS GOOOOO
Would think with the halftime show and the blowout it is final nail in coffin for NFL.
"Cooper Dejean getting the pick 6 on his bday has to be one of the Greatest feelings, eagles drafting 2 rookie CBs paid off big time. Congrats to him and the Eagles"
Born in North Philly but now in Europe with my Ukrainian wife
"5:50 craziest defensive sequence ever, eagles had LOCKS"
Congrats to the Hurts Fly Eagles Fly
The blizzard goes on But still they must fly No one should go Where eagles dare
And that was not offensive pass interference by AJ Brown.
"As an Eagles fan, take that L Nick Wright"
I nominate the Eagles D-line to be known as Rogue Squadron for blowing up the Death Star.
"Chiefs came in expecting Barkley to run this game, Eagles pulled a complete 180 and fooled EVERYBODY! No mercy from Philly!!! Loved every second of this game!"
"If the roles were reversed everyone would be talking about the crazy amount of bad and missed calls against the chiefs. Not saying they deserved to win, they definitely didn't, but the refs were only helping out Phili."
MAN THEY BEAT SONIC THE HEDGEHOG RINGS OUTTA US. THEY LAID HANDS AND FEET AND PUT BELT TO CHEEKS ON US. I KNEW WE WAS DONE WHEN MAHOMES WAS HAPPY OVER THE PRESIDENT... HURTS SAID YEAH OK
Are the animal Philly fans going to climb light poles and burn down the city?
Mahomes seemed to have hallucinations.
Happy for you Jalen Hurts and BOOMER SOONER. Champion Forever! You are Fun to Watch Man.
Patrick mahomes is good but when I heard Tom Brady was announcing the soon to be 3 peat.. I knew this was a W. Go NFL baby we are back
why they hate Cheifs so much
Eaglessssssss
Jalen Hurts is the best QB in the league
Thank you Eagles! From Bengals fans
America won today
"Although Philly fans are the worst across all sports. Thank you for shutting down the chiefs. Sincerely, a bills fan"
"To hell with the Hollywood ""In-crowd"" :)))"
Still scripted though
"This is my first time watched superbowl because of netflix, i thought mahomes was great but meh"
!!!GO EAGLES!!!
"Hurts got the MVP of course, but the Eagles D line won this game. The line played lights out and gave Mahomes no time. Beautiful defense."
"Im calling it now, the Eagles will repeat at Superbowl 60."
Go birds!!! What a game. Happy birthday to saquon barkley and Dejean
A sport people pretend to like.
Nkabawi cla
I guess Taylor Swift budget wasn't enough for this game..
I always said Mahomes can't throw from the pocket.. He was exposed as a fraud tonight
"Loved seeing Mahomes finally getting hit like any other QB in the league and not accruing a ton of flags. Once he was allowed to actually get hit, he couldnt handle the pressure. Also, Chiefs fans are insisting its rigged for the Eagles after swearing its a crazy conspiracy to think that was happening for the Chiefs the entire season? This is such goldto all the Chiefs fans who just said everyone is just crying about itwell, have fun crying about it lol"
This was so intensely satisfying. GO BIRDS.
E-a-g-l-e-s!
"Funny, Chiefs fans are quiet.Just shows you that when the refs dont help you, you are just a mediocre team."
"ALTHOUGH PATRICK MAHOMES LOST BECAUSE OF O-LINE ISSUE, HE PROVED THAT HE'S STILL THE BEST PLAYER ON THE FIELD. LOOK AT THAT ESCAPE."
"Iowa fan here, props to Cooper de Jean"
This is exactly what the Eagles needed to do they needed to get ahead by soooooo much that the game wouldnt come down to a goofy call or a single play or help from the refs. This was an absolute DOMINATING WIN. Im not an Eagles fan but hats off to you. You beat those boys so bad they couldnt even show Taylor!!! Hahahahaha
Dont ever compare mahomes to Brady.
That moment at the end of the first half where KC realized that playing for penalties wasn't going to work this time.
"The Kansas City defense and offense did not go to the Super Bowl, worse still, they never knew that the game had started, they committed penalties and handed out balls that the Eagles converted into points, the receivers dropped key passes to continue the attack against the Eagles. They were unforgivable rookie mistakes and they are not, that's not how you can win a Super Bowl."
Eagles understood that for them to win they would need to make sure the refs couldn't be a factor.
Baaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahah
Its ok kingdom let all those loser fan bases and eagle fans have there lil fun cuz at the end of the day were still the team to beat
Who had it worseDrake or the Chiefs?
It's nice when refs don't intervene... Hey chief fans how does it feel when refs aren't bailing y'all out lol y'all was acting like y'all was gonna walk all over us.. hmm must feel humbled now huh
One of the worst super bowls of all time
Packers remain the only team to win 3 straight titles and they did it twice. 13 titles for Greenbay
"As a Kansas City fan , I must say the best team has won the tournament. Congrats to the Eagles and thank you Kansas City for entertaining us this season"
FLY EAGLES FLY
FLY EAGLES FLY
Hurts was playing Madden out there
"IMO, the Chiefs lost in horrible fashion for a simple reason. Leading up to this Super Bowl the Chiefs were just dreaming of a 3-peat, while the Eagles were thinking about Football! Even as a Cowboys fan, I kind of wanted the Eagles to win this game just to give another stick it to Jerry Jones! The Dallas Cowboys are the only NFC team during the 21st century to not advance to the NFC Championship"
What a great performance Eagles showed!!! It's fantastic !!
Thank you Eagles for exposing the Chiefs for the frauds that they are.
HAHA WE WON LETS GO BIRDS IVE BEEN SAYING ALL YEAR JALEN IS THE BEST QB
"Hey Juju, I hope that Valentine's Day Card is looking nice in Cancun you bum."
So happy what just happened. Thank you eagles.
The KC O-line didnt know what to do with an actual team trying to win
The Eagles demonstrated a master class on how to stop the refs from helping KC. Beat em like a salvation army drum...3peat my a**!
Bucs did it first
I thought Mahomes was the goat! He turned the ball over 3 times!
Feels like the championship was handed to the eagles.
"Man, this loss really Hurts!"
Crazy that kenny pickett got a super bowl ring before dan marino yes he didn't play but stilll being a dolphins fan dan marino was the man
Thank you Philly!
Amen good game
"As a Broncos fan, THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE"
Taylor will be upset and maybe look elsewhere to find a bf who is not a loser and getting old and slow.
Mahomes thought the game aaay
That's the difference between Brady and Mahomes
"I want this same energy next year. Eagles will not be the same team next year. Everyone will want to get paid and it'll look different. On the other side, you think the Chiefs will stand pat on that offensive line??? Stop it! They won't waste that once in a generation qb. But, enjoy your win. FLY BEAGLES FLY"
Squeaking by all year! Refs on their side all year! Amazing what can happen when the opposing team is actually allowed to make contact with Mahomes.
"I knew the eagles would crush them, but I thought Barkley would have a bigger impact . Good win"
"I love seeing their energy slowly go down haha, GG Chiefs, we just wanted to take you down"
From Mahomes to GoHomes.
This would have been even perfect if they could have won when Jason was on the team. He deserved another ring
That false start at 5:31 says it all
KCs first TD drive has the officials helping them again. At the 14:07 mark the third down conversion was an illegal forward pass. Mahomes was past the line of scrimmage when he threw to Kelce.
"Imho you can't play one of your worst seasons, if not the worst in this ""dinasty"", and expect a threepeat to fall in your lap. Not for only this game, but for all season the Chiefs didn't deserve it."
Your welcome football America everyone was tired of KC Cheats go birds!!
Mid-Atlantic Football (WAS-BAL-PHI) is the toughest there is
I'm an eagles fan but I was really tired of everyone saying the refs were helping the chiefs. This game should be proof that that was complete cope. KC was a very good team. Don't discredit a team like that
and the falcons beats this team
Thank you Philly for saving us against both Brady and Mahomes
Congratulations Jalen and Devonta. Shared national championship and now a shared Super Bowl championship. Roll Tide Roll!!!
Fly like a eagle and congratulations on winning the Superbowl against the Kansas City Swiftes.
Wow this was quick af
"Can we hold off on the ridiculous Mahomes Brady comparisons? Mahomes has been worse in 2 SBs losses than Brady ever was in ANY of his. TB12 stole two chips from Mahomes when he was 40+ and Mahomes had far better teams. Not to mention Brady still has over double the rings. Mahomes is great, but lets pump the brakes!"
Cooper dejean
charles barkley said the eagles would win in a blowout shaq said no and made a bet that the chiefs would win
I'm taking Philly in a blowout. Don't tell me.
The worst team in the league won the super bowl
LETS GO EAGLES FLY EAGLES FLY
My neighbor Timmy is a better QB than Mahomes this game
Watched game in a casino in Kansas. Nothing but Mahomes and Kelce jerseys. Long story short. I now have 500 extra dollars and the guy next to me has a really pissed off wife.
Edp445 would be proud
"As a ""recreational"" watcher of american football im curious about something. To me it feels like the referees really want to put them selfs in the action and make an impact. In hockey it is usually the other way around. The more important the match the less the men in stripes try to put them selfs in the center of the event. Or have i missed something?"
Thank you eagles...from a Texans fan
I'm going to Philadelphia to get a philly cheesesteak now
"Great game plan by the Eagles, excellent discipline. But, my WTF moment and unfortunately another suspicious event was pulling Hurts, putting Pickett in to throw on 4th down? Uh, don't you punt the ball and make KC go the length of the field, instead of starting at mid field? At the time, the ""over"" had not been reached. While the starters were goofing around on the sidelines, KC put 14 on the board to push the over. Say what you will, but the last 2 TD's seemed gratuitous. Too many gambling sites in play to believe KC just got lucky."
As a diehard chiefs fan im not even upset we got to the Super Bowl when tbh we shouldnt have at all. In my personal opinion its good the eagles won for the fact of making it more exciting! I think chiefs need to fire matt nagy and let mahomes be mahomes! I feel this next season will be his revenge tour congratulations though to Philadelphia well deserved
"13:00 - Jalen Hurts was like, Alright, lets end this thingYEET!"
"This is definitely a win for the league. First it denies the coveted Three Peat Champion title to a lousy, undeserving, overachieving Chiefs team, when super teams like the Packers, the Steelers, the 49ers, the Cowboys, the Broncos or the Patriots couldnt even pull it off. But more importantly, it reminds the rest of the league that the NFC East remains the NFL Beast of this league. Most championships, most championship appearances, only division where all members are not only champions, but multi-crowned champions. So count it down with me people: 5 Super Bowls for the Cowboys 4 Super Bowls for the Giants 3 Super Bowls for the Redskins (R.I.P.) 2 Super Bowls for the Eagles 1 Superior Divison"
bye KC. 2 back to back doesn't make a dynasty.
"Josh Sweat had the game of his life, Jalen Hurts had the game of his life, Cooper Dejean had the game of his life, Jake Elliott finally came thru, the Philadelphia Eagles offense and defense were dominant, WHAT A GAME! America is happy tonight! Someone please check on Nick Wright while we are at it!"
"Congrats Philadelphia, I assure you, to us Raider fans your beat down will always be respected and remembered. We are envious, but also happy. Enjoy this. Take the week off and celebrate. Hell, take the month!"
Fly eagles fly
Sweet revenge against the KC refs. LFG
Roger Goodell and the NFL refs had a bad night tonight
TOO MANY ADS!
"I feel Mahomes had too much pressure to surpass Brady. He had a similar start giving away a pick 6 as Brady's win over Falcon, but unfortnately its was too big a gap for Mahomes to come back."
GO BIRDs
"what a terrible scorebug design, looks so amateurish"
Thank God the ref is not there to win Chief the game.
#FlyFly
"The eagle taking down the chiefs even being underrated what a game, I am proud that my eagle won the super bowl"
First Aussie to win a superbowl congratulations to Jordan Mailata from Souths to a Super Bowl well done indeed Sir
"Chiefs and Taylor Swift can go home, and cry, i hate the Chiefs"
FLY EAGLES FLY
14:13 patty crossed the line of scrimmage before the shovel pass refs looked the other way
As A Bears Fan Fly Eagles Fly
Chiefs got lucky so many times with so many games being decided on one play. Finally they show their true colors this season on the big stage of them being just an average but lucky team. Should of been Ravens or Bills against Eagles.
And they say Saquon was the reason yall made it when were up by 24-0 in halftime without him scoring a single touchdown
As a Chiefs fan Im mad but it was a really fair game and we played terrible up until the 4th quarter but the thing is everybody is hating on the Chiefs but if Philadelphia win 2 in a row everybody will hate on the Eagles.
Mahomes finally exposed because he didnt have his 12th man the refs helping him.
TOO BIG TO RIG
Chiefs fans just get to join the 30 fanbases that didnt win it all this season
Full highlights also available in Brazzers
Well done eagles you certainly done a number on the chiefs!! Smashed them all game cant stand that Taylor swift an absolute beast of a woman hope shes on epsteins list !! Drain the swamp
As a nuetral fan this was one of the worst super bowls. Up there with Seattle vs Denver
This is revenge for 2 years ago
As a Bengals fan.thank you for embarrassing KC. Bravo.
For once Philly got to b the heroes in this story
"Last time was infinity war, this time was endgame"
This is what happens when the chiefs cant cheat and this was one for the books here the best defense I seen in a minute good lawd
No Refs... no won!!!
god bless this time we saw more plays from the players on the court than taylor swift ..... god bless bill belichick xD
No 3 peats sorry Chiefies.
Whats all the people who say nfl is rigged where yall at lol this game alone showed nfl is a real mans sport
"With all these new stupid rules about contact, in what is a contact sport. What chance do the refs have??"
They were beating the brakes off of them
Taylor Swift curse. From Chiefs to Cheaps.
Mahomes looking around for the refs help
The only thing worse than the game was the halftime show. Worst Super Bowl ever.
How does no Chief throw Hurts to the ground after that 50 yard bomb up 27? You gotta do something with that kind of disrespect in your throat.
gohomes
"Congrats to the Eagles. They were awesome all year and played their best in the NFCCG and the Super Bowl, where it matters most."
Queefs and the Swifties got humbled tonight and it was well deserved.
Chiefs aren't nothing without refs and this game proves it. Jalen put on a show with his running and throwing. Complete package. If Barkley had a good game this would have been way worse
Haha cheater chiefs got whooped
America is back.
Eagles HAWKAW
"And the deep echoing voice of Pat Summerall from above, sounding much like the voice of God said.THERE WILL BE NO THREE PEAT ! ( See 1990 championship, Giants @ Niners ) - Belicek,DC of Giants. Absolutely killer game!"
No Taylor Swift sightings? Sounds like a win for us all
Most satisfying game of all time.
Well swift be single soon. I havent watched in a while so west coast offense is now the standard. I saw one run play.
Very reminiscent of SB-55. The best pass-defense is a QB on the ground still holding the ball.
Successful hate watch 2025
34-0 is wild
Mahomes looked mediocre all year and in this game he looked even worse than mediocre
The eagles can thank Washington
"shades of the tampa bay super bowl. Mahomes was flustered, didnt know what hit him.."
Hes a frog not a GOAT. No help from refs this time.
I dont ever remember Brady getting blown out in the SB
sick of the ads nfl
No three peat
Hopefully The Chiefs Domination Era is over.
That was the most obvious scripted game Ive ever watched and Im not a chiefs fan
Seems like the refs got a reality check after they saw the ticket sales
Chiefs fans deserved this L
Eagles two time Super Bowl Win!
"Its still Tom Brady as the goat, Then still in second Joe Montana he never threw an interception let alone a pick six in a Super Bowl, and he won all 4 he was in, pat still gots a ways to go"
This hurts to watch
Finally another championship is brought back to the nfc east.
"Looks like Chiefs slept through 3 quarters, congrats to Eagles"
Got a mahomes ad before this
Defense wins championships. Eagles defense every 3rd down just smothered KC.
34-0 is crazy work
Its crazy how narrative for the chiefs been the same while under performing yet we expected the eagles to make to the super bowl any other team might crumble in a game like this just like how the lions didnt blow out the commanders like we expect
Fly Eagles Fly!!!
The chefs lost because momes got inverted and the chefs playerare getting money still
"I hope all these new eagles fans stick to theirs guns. GG yall. We got beat. But just a quick reminder,we went YEARS of not even making the playoffs. Hope yall love your new fandome"
Im so excited that the Eagles won. Im not an eagles fan but Thank you for winning and dominating the Chiefs.
"Thank you so much Philly Eagles, for winning the Super Bowl and taking down the chiefs. It really feels great."
Taylor gonna break up with Travis AHAHHAHAHAHAHAA keep that ring to yoself bro u aint proposing
Defition of satisfaction
"That was just as satisfying as when the Bucs did it. Thank you Eagles, thank you <3"
It took the Avengers 2x to beat Thanos and thats what the eagles did
Thank God!
And just like that the dynasty is over
Tom we didn't ask you what you like.SHUT UP.CHEETAH
My Mom Likes The Eagles So I'm Glad The Eagles Won. I Love Burhardt & Brady's Calls. Tom Brady Will Return Next Year.
"Now that was a Super Bowl Im sure the entire country enjoyed, except for maybe Dallas"
Mahomes was having flashbacks of superbowl 55
That's crazy this is chatting Pat got sack 6 or 5 time
What a game by the Eagles!!!! As an Eagles fan this is as GOOD as it gets! We got to Mahomes the best Ive seen In A long time. Fly Eagles Fly
"When the eagles got that pick 6 i knew it was over. By the way, i wasnt rooting for neither team. I just wanted to see a great game"
This is what happens when mahomo doesn't get help from the refs.
Mahomes is the first QB in SB history to throw for under 25 yards in the first half... Not to mention that pick 6 and 2 INT's looks like his legs are gone already .. He's done
GO BIRDS!!!!
Half of the world hunger was solved by 150% after this eagles win
"What a great thing to see, down with the Hollyweird woke cult celebrities and the Chiefs! It's a great day for humanity. Thank you Philly...."
I hate the Cheifs and Patrick Mahomes. Very satisfying
LETS GO EAGLES!!!
I have said many times KC were a mediocre team and they were only winning by luck or by referees help. And tonight they were smacked by the Eagles. Congratulations Eagles
I havent felt this excited since the Seahawks trashed the Broncos
Weird score board
13:53 The first time the chiefs reached Eagles territory.
Unimportant but thats a horrible score bug. How uninteresting
They literally lost this game like they lost the last Superbowl
I won that prop bet of Kenny Pickett playing more than one series and getting the victory kneel downs
This is what happens when the refs don't help the Chiefs. Deal with it. Sincerely: Every REAL Fan of Football
As a Niners fan this felt so good lol
Offside from the snapper refs still tried to help lol
Tonight American football won
"Mahomo is a fraud who will never be Montana, let alone Brady. Imagine if the refs didnt cheat the 9ers out of his first sb?"
Brady merely being in the building defeats the Patrick Mahomes
28 other teams are thanking you guys rn
Anyone else get the Bundlerooski ad
nfl is a pathetic product
They had Brady cast this?
Eagles SuperBowl 59 Champions
Crazy facemask not even called
"""tHrEE pEaT"""
This is what the real Chiefs look like when the refs arent giving them free stuff.
That call to dial up Devonte Smith after being up 27-0 is one of the greatest calls in super bowl history. You don't fool around with a dynasty.
"Not gonna lie, that halftime show really was mid."
Thank you Philly!!!
Pov me crashing out over losing by 28 points
Lets fukin gooo
second lost remember tom brady also beat patrick mahomes once and they both has lose to eagles one time 2018 and 2025
Saquon Barkley is a SUPER BOWL CHAMPION
Is it me or does it seem like the defense letting my home boy get sacked
"Philly fans don't deserve this. Ya the same fans who wanted Hurts and Sirianni gone, and now you're all gonna celebrate them? Like ya didn't wish for their demise"
What are they going to say now?! Hurts is a legit top 5 qb
uglyahh bland scoreboard
No more Taylor queefs lol
Cheifs was finna come back if it wasnt for the time
This is America
3 in a row fly eagles fly
you know what? You chiefs nation don't deserve our Taylor. We thought you guys were the best team like Taylor is in all of music.
Loved the game. I was so impressed by Hurts. Go Eagles!
"Quite frankly, the 22 - 40 scoreline flattered the Chiefs. The Eagles were so much better than the Chiefs and deserved to have won by a much wider margin."
"I mean the refs helped the eagles a lot this game, but I will say I dont think the chiefs wouldve won either way"
Finally no more kellce no more swift and no more chiefs.
The GM for the Giants is hanging from a light fixture in his garage.
This was a massacre not a match
Crazy low-key the refs were so pose to let mahomo win
The eagles waited years for their vengeance
The Chiefs have a terrible Offensive Line...they are soft and cannot protect Mahomes....need to replace all of them before next year. Congrats to the Eagles!
13:01 what you came for
Good lord mahomes was god awful in this game until it was stat padding time. You cant get humiliated in 2 super bowls have anyone call you the goat. That was brutal to watch.
Thank You Philadelphia Eagles Fly Eagles Fly
The Eagles are the champs! The chiefs can go cry to themselves to sleep!
Nick Wright! LOL
For Tom Brady Mahomes he is just a little boy
mahomes cant make a play hahaha
NO MORE G.O.A.T. CONVERSATION PLEASE BRADY IS THE G.O.A.T. AND HE BEAT MAHOMES BEING 40+ YEARS OLD MAHOMES IS ONE OF THE BEST
"As a pats fan, thank god there wasnt a three-peat. Thank you eagles!"
Best Super Bowl since LII!
Chiefs had not Business beeing in the Super Bowl in first place.
"This Hurtz to say as a cowboys fan, but tonight the birds were americas team! THANK YOU EAGLES"
"Best night of my life. It took everyone but we prevented quite possibly the most annoying victory in any sport. Congratulations Eagles, you did what so many teams couldnt this year, and got your revenge"
"A glorious day for the rest of the NFL, sans Chiefs. And therefore, the world."
"Well, I guess the Eagles proved you can stop Patrick Mahomes if you completely obliterate his offensive line."
"Heck of a performance Philly, played lights out when it counted the most."
Nick Wright is going to be real quiet tomorrow
The Chiefs actually did a great job keeping Saquon Barkley in check. You'd never think the final score would be what it was. But they got the job done! Congrats to the Eagles and their fans.
Sweet revenge. Fly Eagles Fly. Cant wait for another beat down next year. spags defense LOL
Thank you. Awesome season
If you a eagles fan I love you
"Tkx Chiefs your still my Fav team. Just not enough, Eagles looked like you did in other years."
Eagles Dline was getting tore up.
This was definitely the super bowl of all time
FLY Eagles FLY
"Please, respect Jalen Hurts. Thats all I ask"
"Mahomes is out of the goat debate forever, that's embarrassing"
Everyone was a Eagles today and boy did they deliver
The eagle has landed https://youtu.be/eKxL6aFCIZ8?si=VxEM0FEcxrgxbnB8
we lit in philly
15:41
Too big to rig!!!
Mahomes blocked by his own teammate
It's a shame that the Eagles will lose Kellen Moore to the Saints!
"chiefs fan here, glad the refs didn't make any questionable calls, wasn't chiefs season this year but that's ok. Hats off to the eagles they played really well"
That first call on eagles was so dumb
As a chiefs fan that hurt... a lot... but we'll be back year so keep your heads up chiefs kingdom
"What a generationally horrendous pitiful excuse for a ""performance"" from MaFRAUD"
Let the eagles fly baby F KC
The bomb to Smith was a beautiful play call by Moore!
"for the first time ever, i don't see taylor swift at all in this 19-minute Super Bowl video, very satisfying"
Lets goooooooo we goin to the eagles bus tooo
ESPN released their 2025-2026 early power rankings Chiefs 1 Bills 2 Lions 3 Eagles 4 Ravens 5 Sad nasty work
Patrick and chiefs o line was getting absolutely violated by philly
Play callers are chiefs fans sounds like
Go Birds! Loved every second of that blowout! Revenge is a dish best served cold!
Rams were the only team that really battled the Eagles.
So much for the three peat...
"KC LOST, ENJOY THAT YOU TRUMPTARDS"
lebronnnnnn
"As a Bills fan, I say thank you Eagles."
Tom Brady makes it to another Super Bowl.
From a Niners fan.. Good job Saquon and Jalen. Props to yall.
Vic and the D helped the Eagles win this Super Bowl!
As a chiefs fan congrats to the eagles.. they did a great job...
How do y'all think the game would've gone if the Bills were in there instead? I think it might have been a little closer game. Glad the Eagles won though.
Yes indeed didn't work this time refs
I THOUGHTR CHIEFS HAD A GOOD QB. SORRY I DONT WATCH MUCH NFL
Taylor swift is 0-2 in 2025
I don't know why I'm so happy for saquon
Lions fan here. Glad the Eagles won!!
Eagles won for America. Thank you
Yes the Eagles avenged us Bills
la liga what?? la liga ? what? corso italia pvto fvtsal m.f. i got that white and red.... mf. sp cs
*CONGRATS TO THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES - SUPER BOWL LIX CHAMPIONS !!*
"Beating us in Super Bowl 57 was the biggest mistake of your life, Mahomes. Fly Eagles Fly"
Yes sir the Chief no help from the Referee They wouldnt win Mahomes go and cry go make some cookies and Kalcey go with Taylor swift makes record hahaha cry baby
Brady woulda made a game out of it
What a worst game.
Jake Elliott didn't miss a single field goal the whole entire game
OMG I thought Denver was playin in the Superbowl for a minute
In your face Taylor! You couldnt rig more games anymore
"I feel like that throw to D hop was rigged, false start rigged, pi rigged,"
Shows that the Chiefs really weren't that good this year like at all
"Bills or Ravens would have gave us a better game. Chiefs were never a matchup for this team. Hey Chiefs fans, Bengals fan here. Hows it feel?"
"The Chiefs lost, America won today!!!"
Wish they had this kind of refereeing in Super Bowl LIV & LVIII
"I guess everyone, including Chiefs , found out what happens when you play an actual good team for once this season. Who would have thought"
"This win has me thinking about getting a car a Toyota Camry on my birthday Monday the 10th of February as it's only fitting after an Eagles win, as Toyota is the official car of the NFL and the Eagles!"
Everybody looks good until they play THE EAGLES!!!!!
The refs werent getting payed a lot from Kermit AKA Patty Mahomes and they turn on him in the biggest game of the year
Y'all Chiefs fans crying
"Guys, how 'bout those Chiefs?"
Wheres swift coverage at
"As a cowboy fan, congrats eagles fans for making our front office look like the jackasses they are and for being relevant for the last 30 years."
I THRIVE ON CHIEF TEARS
America is a happier place today because of Philly's W. Thanks so much
Game highlights dont even have half the views of the halftime show. I didnt even know what teams was playing until today. Kendrick won
Interesting how they dont show bad throws from Patrick (only the ints) but they do with Hurts
13:06 skinny batman
It would have been a lot cooler if the Eagles would have kept it looking like the absolute disgrace that it was.
Everybody happy... Happy ending... Happy ever after
The UI was so bad
Mahomes is horrible in the pocket and it looks like he's lost a step ..
The 15-2 curse continues
No help from the refs and they get exposed
Is it true that President Felon bolted by halftime?
Wat no ref privileges
"Eagles defense didnt even blitz the whole game still was unstoppable, remind me when the Seahawks destroyed Peyton in 2013"
Eagles just manhandled the Chiefs
Bye bye Travis. Or should I say bye bye Travlor. Roster change gonna be crazy....
Hello future me
6:13 pick 6 sold them
6 sacks on no blitzes is absolutely wild
Hell in hindsight the KC should have started with Carson haha
The world is healing
Congratulations philly. Second time they took down a legend. 2017 2025.
"Seeing Mahomes getting pummeled and Travis Kelce the cuck, lose was such a good highlight"
men i am so glad eagles won but will someone do something with these refs
Let the Eagle soar!!! :D
"The Eagles flew, and the Chiefs could not catch up."
This is what happens when the chiefs arent good enough to cheat
"Thank goodness, America was spared having to see TS every freaking 5 seconds. Now go away!"
"Seeing Mahomes getting pummeled and Travis Kelce the cuck, lose was such a good highlight"
Thank god time for the chiefs to go ma-home
This is what happens when the Refs aren't on the Chiefs side. :)
PM is overrated. He wont win another SB
"With the Chiefs getting all the ref calls for years, THIS is the only way to beat them by blowing them out & giving them no chance."
"Hurts on the Sneak , Elementary my dear Dotson , you win! either way! that 3rd round pick seemed way to much till now, yet you earned it ?1"
"As a Bills fan, thank you Eagles for saving us!!"
America won tonight.
I can just keep rewatching this over and over. Get owned KC and overrated Mahomes
"One of the worst performances by a QB in NFL Super Bowl history This team, and Mahomes, were fraudulent all year. As soon as Mahomes isnt getting plays schemed open, he is MID. The Chiefs were exposed 3 turnovers in his own territory. HUGE black mark on his record He had an 11 QBR - absolutely abysmal."
"No threesome for taylor swift and kelse, I mean threepeat!!!"
Easily the most satisfying Super Bowl blowout in history.
Seeing Mahomes losing was worth the price of admission.
This is the 2nd SB Mahomes stunk out the place.. Mahomes fan losers are long gone from this comment thread And if you are here losers I'm Waiting for you *WAITS*
So for all the anti Chiefs cry babies ; is the NFL not rigged anymore or is it that your team won so the narrative just disappears in thin air ?!
Thank you Philadelphia Eagles for saving the NFL by beating the Kansas City Chiefs!
How can Eagles fans celebrate if the games rigged and the outcomes are predetermined?
I guess the NFL doesn't want any other team to 3 peat besides the Packers
Tom Brady the GOAT hands down!
"Idc bout everything else. Just happy Barkley got a ring n submitted himself as the still best RB in the league rn. ""He's washed. Trade him"". Those clowns sound stupid now fs lol"
Eagles on top
this scoreboard is not good change it back
IT'S ABOUT DANG TIME THE CHIEFS GOT A TASTE OF THEIR OWN REF BASED MEDICINE!
All that cheating just to get blown out in the Super Bowl
GO EAGLES
Philly the city will party all night long they clearly will not sleep tonight in the city of brotherly love!
It was a pretty balanced game. At times the Eagles humiliated the Chiefs and at times the Chiefs got humiliated
By by Chiefs.....it's time to wake up..........and the Chiefs respond: they score another one???
He didn't mean to put his hand in his face---that guy was too short was all
"Welp, looks like the Kansas City Refs couldn't pull it off tonight."
Wonder if Taylor Swift is gonna dump Travis now and write a song about it because he lost the Super Bowl.
"As a Chiefs fan, congrats to the Eagles. That was a beatdown, a clinic, a masterful win and domination from start to finish. Knew this was a dangerous team but this was on another level. Great win and congrats. You guys are the champions."
I dont know what was worse the Chiefs or the halftime show
game was rigged for philadelphia
"Hey KC, this is what happens when you lie on your resume."
Glad the KC Thiefs lost! Their fans are primarily made up of bandwagoners.
"this is what happens when the refs dont call everything in your favor, when the field isnt spray painted before the game, and when you dont get fake roughing the passer calls. Save the proposal for next year. 3peat? Defeat."
So happy for Jalen Hurts. He was outstanding tonight and outplayed Mahomes in two Super Bowls. Eagles will go down in NFL history as the 3 peat killers. They stopped New England in 2017 & the Chiefs tonight. Thats so dope
As a Falcons fan congratulations to the Eagles....this wasn't the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce show
Kansas City you should be embarrassed your team didn't even show up
95 points in 2 games
Who else didnt watch the game but is happily watching the highlights once they found out the Eagles won?
Maybe Hurts or Barkley should have got MVP afterall.
"Sack, sack pick 6, one of the best things Ive seen, beautiful"
Chiefs threw the game for a money payout
"Sad lions fan here but glad to see Saquon get a ring and ofc, anyone but Mahomes and the chiefs"
"Tom Brady, ""down 24 in the third quarter in the superbowl, no quarterback could come back from that... unless they were the GOAT"""
Mahomes with no refs in his pocket is just a normal QB
Good win Eagles... also BRADY will always be the GOAT not maholmes
Last time aint have no black players on the victory stage not even Graham and he won it this time everybody up there shouts to the eagles best in the league
14:14 no flags??
Its a shame jason retired couldve had his revenge win against his brother
"As A Packers Fan , I thought the chiefs were going to 3 peat but congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles for stopping the Chiefs 3 peat"
"So I didn't watch live this year... But OMG, that was an absolute domination! It effectively looked like a shutout. Eagles were basically just allowing KC to save some face with reserves in at the end. Congrats Eagles, well deserved!"
Eagles and the refs
Never compare Mahomes to Brady ever again
Hope the Eagles get on a dynasty run as if everyone stays healthy next year they can repeat!
Sweet Sweet Revenge! Got it on the Pats and now the Chiefs!!!
I think it's safe to say that pretty much every fan base outside of Kansas City are Eagles fans tonight! Bless you boys!
There will be no three peat!
Dotson first td
Too big to rig
"In the honor of Kendrick Lamar, I indeed turned the TV off in the 4th. Game sucked besides the Chiefs losing."
Go eagles boo Chiefs
"It should be titled, Eagles Super Bowl 59 highlights and the chiefs were there"
That O line was CRACKING under the pressure of the Eagles Defense.
"Goodnight America, I'm drunk."
Turning point for the chiefs was?
Hey haters.. Jalen hurts is forever addressed as super bowl MVP.
Refs didn't do their job today so the better team won.
Christopher mad dog russo is happy i know that for sure!
Kansas Fried Chiefs! What is Mahommes pokemon evolution? Machokes!
"Not so tough without the refs, been winning games that weren't supposed to be won at all. Eyes everywhere , FLY EAGLES"
"Straight MOLLYWHOPPED thanks, Philly! Signed, America"
"Anyone else but me think this game was weird or off? Patrick was making moves/mistakes that he never usually does. Saw a couple of guys not even rushing to take down Eagles players. They let them keep going. Then you have Karlaftis waving his arms like crazy and not even trying to tackle the quarterback. Like what?? Patrick getting sacked like over 5 times in single game?? Insanity. I know the Eagles are great players but something was off in the way the Chiefs were playing. And then afterwards, Jalen Hurts is not even enthusiastic about winning. Like, there was no emotion from him. Nor from his wife/gf. She barely kissed him and gave him a quick embrace instead of jumping into his arms and saying, ""You did it babe! Congratulations!"" Their interaction was cold and his interview with Erin Andrew's was moot point. This superbowl was the weirdest I've seen. Again, congrats to the Eagles but this game was weird. I wish Jalen was a bit more happy and celebrating like his teammates. Oh and a big thank you to Xavier Worthy for rising up and getting those points for his team. Without him, they'd still be at 7 points."
This still isnt satisfying after all the cheating for Kansas City over the years.. NFL is not forgiven.. many watch just to see them fall but they didnt want to watch the game because all of the cheating over the years. True NFL fans know what I am talking about. Philly should have been champions for the second time all ready. Just shows you that The Chiefs shouldnt have been in the Super Bowl in the first place. They should have lost about 7 games this year. The cruel summer is over!!!
"OMG! KC and the First Downs, so awesome. They are a great band."
"Wow, reminds me of the games from the 80s when the NFC team just pasted the AFC team every year."
Mahomes has already lost leg and foot speed and he could never throw from the pocket.. He's reached his ceiling Anyone disagree I'm *WAITING* for you
1 positive for the Chiefs was Xavier Worthy's TD. Also showed maturity by not celebrating his TD's knowing how far behind the Chiefs were.
Elliot deserves his flowers!!!!
Rigged
Jalen Hurts is absolutely unbelievable
I have never been happier to see a team lose in my life.
This Super Bowl was BORING
America needed this.
SENDING BG OUT A WINNER
"As much as I wanted the chiefs to lose, and I'm very glad they did, I still would have preferred it to be a close game lol this was just sad."
I cant stand KC but Philly fans are bottom feeders.
Thank you Eagles for keeping the camera off of Taylor Swift and more on the game.
So happy the Chiefs were frauds
yall thanking the eagles now but wait till yall get your rude awakening on how obnoxious eagles fans are
Love the chiefs failing. This is amazing!
"So happy to see Kansas lose. Great game, Eagles!"
Party at Mark Whalburg's house!!
Can we acknowledge Foxes new graphics package
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
"Well Done Philly, Well Done!"
"Chiefs defense is really bad. They will need to do a complete overhaul if they ever want to win another trophy. Also, the OL is a disaster and they need to draft a stud RB with speed and elusiveness. Hunt & Pecheo aren't the answer. They could have used a RB in this game to take the pressure off Mahomes early on. Anyway, I hated that the Eagles won but the Chiefs came in flat."
Great game to the Eagles players! But you Eagles fans/Chiefs haters are insufferable. Stay on top too long and people find reasons to excuse your success. Happens to every team that falls.
"Glad to see another Eagles Super Bowl win in my lifetime! This one was such a blowout, as the Birds were much more a superior and better team over the Chiefs by far!"
I tried to tell people !
Congratulations to the broadstreet bullies from Philly
Worthy should've had 300 receive yards the way he was playing! The kid is nice!
Eagles make NFL great again
Kansas City Chiefs Reign of terror: 2023-2025
Refs can't help ya every game
This could not happen to a better team
"Dispite the refs, the Eagles won."
THE BIRDS SAVED US!
OH YES THE EVIL EMPIRE IS BEATEN.
"Best defense in the NFL! Best QB, as well; Hurts just doesn't have the same PR machine Mahomes does. If Sirianni hadn't taken pity on the Chiefs and put second-stringers on the field during junk-time, KC would have been even further shamed."
You know your franchise is hated when everyone roots for the opponent that threw snowballs at Santa Claus
This is gonna be the NFL's most liked and viewed vid for a while lmao
Thank you Philly for your service America thanks you
Eagles stopped two 3-Peats from happening. Thats crazy lmao
"As a niners fan, we sided with Philly tonight. Fantastic game"
It would appear the Eagles remembered that cheap holding penalty that cost them the last SB! So much for GOAT mahomeslol
Phillys D demolished KC. This is the end of the KC dynasty. They won't make the playoffs next year.
nfl is pretty boring
I like how they showed Taylor Swift one time in the 3rd quarter. As if that was gonna help.
Defense WINS!
Ref tried to set the tone with that first bs call.
This was like watching election night !! Im watching the game again
Look like the QBs are slow to hand off the ball now a days.
Thank you Birds. We've all wanted to see Mahomes get sacked that many times.
Jalen Hurts the Chiefs
"From a True Blue Giants Fan, I am so happy for Saquon. The Giants didn't deserve a RB like him. We couldn't give him a line to block for him, we embarrassed him by not commiting to him on live TV, and we paid Daniel Jones more money than him when Saquon was the entire offense. Congrats to you, Saquon! Enjoy your off season as a Super Bowl Champ!"
My guys came (way) short. But still my guys. Go Chiefs!
"Eagles Defense just clamped the chiefs. Honestly, the chiefs need a better o line. If they fire Andy Reid over this itll be the biggest chief bruh moment of all time"
THE GIANTS ARE SICKKKKKK
Can we stop saying Kelce is better than Tony Gonzalez?
2024 Eagles are the greatest team in NFL HISTORY
Mahomes got more sacks than I ever ordered from White Castle.
The eagles defense put on a clinic
Eagles are Americas mascot for a reason . Stopped Brady and Mahomes. Thank you. - A Broncos fan
ye
They're deleting Talor Sweeft comments cant make this shi up
F KC!!!! Fly eagles fly MFs
The Threepeat is No More
Howie your a genius please resign Zach Baun in the offseason!
40-22
Taylor swift album coming soon
"Marvelous!!! Beyond my Dreams!!! What an absolute and total annihilation. Cherry on the cake, the mental tic-tac taunting to not even play full throttle half the game. They made a prime Dynasty quit under half the battle and then casually gave them some bread to endure the ending pain. UN-FREA-KIN-BELIEVABLE!!! From France here and everyone around the worlds, Eagles fans everywhere, THIS IS FOR YOU!!! This Franchise is now nicknamed at the ""DYNASTY KILLERS"" and ""40 Burgers for SB goats"". E-A-G-L-E-S!!!"
The refs tired it
i wonder what will the Eagles will look like next year after all the poaching is done.
Bta and eaglesss are champsssdss
The patriots chiefs
Mahomes coming back next season
Rigged ...from a Canadian
J- Hizzle and the eagles massacred the chiefs it wasnt even close mvp Jalen hurts never a doubt biggest win and super bowl in eagles history
"Crazy, man the refs made a fair game and look at that score"
How many sacks
THE CHIEFS MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE CHEATING SCANDAL IS OVERRRRRR
As a chargers fan I approve of the eagles message.
K C O C K Y
Funny how the NFL is rigged till the Chiefs lose. Y'all some excuse makin losers.
Lets go Eagles
WHERE TAYLOR SWIFT AT NOW
It's like they thought Jalen couldn't do it and bet it all on that
It must have been the sweet for Cooper DeJean and Saquon Barkley to win a Super Bowl on their birthdays. Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles!
Was mahomes not past the like of scrimmage on that flip pass to kelce?
Offense wins games; Defense wins championships. Cannot beat the #1 defense
Patrick was clearly affected by the rush tonight not one of his better Super Bowls similar to his loss to Tampa!
no more black magic thank GOD
13:06 15:45 Easily 2.Moments that will live in superbowl history forever
"""Thanks Eagles!"" -The rest of America (Excluding Dallas, New York, DC, and Pittsburgh)"
I wonder if the NFL learned anything about trying to push a certain team into the Super Bowl. Bills would have challenged the Eagles much better than this and overall ratings would have been much better because of it
Congratulations to anyone that won some tonight. GO BIRDS!
wow that was a beat down
GO Chiiiiiiefs! y'll never be alone
Don't ever bet against the chiefs ??? Well I bet against the chiefs and won. Won the bet against my brother as well congrats to the eagles. So happy the queefs lost
Where's Taylor
The wooping of drake and the chiefs googly moogly
Love the EAGLES
Theres a lot of comments here for everyone saying theyre not watching the game and to boycott
Very Fun Fact: Eagles are the only franchise to beat both Mahomes and Brady in the Super Bowl!
This was the greatest day for anyone who wasnt a chiefs fan
"Mahomes who? ,"
Saqoun Barkley got shut TF down all game...
"Hurts proves he's so determined and a winner stood in against the blitz and won with his legs, nice to see him win Super Bowl MVP!"
Theres a god
hell yeah!!!
"GG to the eagles, outplayed the chiefs by a mile..."
"As the late Pat Sumerall once said, ""There Will Be No Three-Peat!"
"Taylor Swift better be grateful for the chiefs. Without our red jersey, she's just another pop singer. GO CHIEFS REVENGE!"
Man the eagles beat the chiefs like they stole something
How bout them eagles we dominated them Kansas City cheats Superbowl champions
Buffalo would've been a better game in my opinion
"As a broncos fan, Im glad that the Eagles won. Go birds!!"
"As a Denver Fan I can't thank the Eagles enough for stopping the cheifs 3 peat and doing it in style at the same time, congrats on the SuperBowl"
well...we know who the real and only goat is
"The Eagles had the same amount of points (22) from their special teams and Defense as the Chiefs had all game and possessed the ball for nearly 2/3 the game and won the turnover battle. This is the result you will get 99% of the time that happens. Not even a ""Magician"" can change that nor the refs. The Eagles got a Chip off Brady/Pats and Mahomes/Chiefs which both resulted in stopping 3peats literally or in hindsight so now they're forever known as the 3 Peat Crushers. Fly Eagles Fly"
Aint no 3 peat happening over here
Fly eagles fly !!!!
God worst day ever. Congrats eagles fans
and here comes allllll the giants fans trying to take credit for meat riding saquon
If only the Eagles hadnt taken the boot off of Reids neck in the 4th. The overrated refball merchants didnt deserve that mercy
Hurts looked like a very composed leader out there. Cool as a cucumber.
Wow! One team decided to show up and play. Were/are the Chiefs that bad? I havent seen an effort that bad in a Super Bowl since the 70s.
"7:30, quite a bit of showboating for a team thats DOWN 17 - NOTHING LMAO"
The Refs still tried their best to help the Cheifs but they were so bad today not even the Refs could help them make this one close!
I understand it now
Green Bay still the only team to win 3 NFL Championships in a row
"okay, but why didn't the Seahawks run the ball?"
we got a 3 peat go chiefs we won
Elliott an ace tonight 4/4 on FG's including a 50 yarder!
Yesssssss fly eagles man
Brady knows hes still the
"The two best teams were not on the field, this is the result of the NFL fix, a sh*tty Supr bowl.. BOOOOOOOOOOO"
The defense was the real MVP!!!
Seeing Mafroggo get decked in the 4th was so nice to see
The Philadelphia Eagles are two-time Super Bowl champions.
behavior if Philly wasnt your team and you up in these comments.
Those corrupt refs didn't save the Chiefs this time. The NFL is saved. FLY EAGLES FLY TO THE WAY TO VICTORY. E.A.G.L.E.S EAGLES!!!
The Eagles have saved the NFL!!
Chiefs were a 10-7 team masquerading as a 15-2 team. They were playing on black magic and Houdini luck all season. Only a matter of time before something like this happened.
This was one of the most satisfying Superbowls I've ever watched.
I don't blame you all. KC born and I'm tired of it. JK we're taking it next on our new run of Super Bowl wins. 3peat coming up. CHIEFS
Goodell is fuming and just called emergency meeting to investigate the script failure
What a shame the Bills didn't get it done. They would have put up a better fight.
Thank god.
"Yeah dont even remotely feel bad about my Skins loss, that Eagles team is stupid stacked, best O and Dline in the biz, its stupid"
what happened kc?? I thought yall was 3 peating
How sweet it is Eagles showed they were clearly the best team in the NFL tonight!
HAHAHA 4 u Mahomo You ain't no Brady you ain't no Montana you ain't no Warner you paper xchamoion dats it
"Boring, anticlimactic, and nothing memorable. Mahomes just played bad"
"NFL hasnt been the same for me since Tom Brady retired, congrats to the eagles though, fantastic performance"
There will be _NOOOO_ three-peat! Saquon just did what Stafford did 3 years ago; win a ring immediately after leaving a lousy franchise.
I hate the Eagles and im so happy lol. Funny thing when the refs are finally under full scrutiny for rigging games for the Chiefs the Chiefs lose...lolololol
"As he was flying to New Orleans, Patrick Mahomes had a feeling he forgot something but he couldnt quite make out what it was. Sometime in the first half he realized that the thing he forgot was his refs!"
Philly Cheese Steak with Eggs and extra nacho cheese all over it
"Bills defense, please take note..."
Here's hoping Chris jones' injury doesn't keep him out for too long
MAHOMES U FORGOT TO KISS THE REF BRUH
Chiefs out there looking like Helen Keller on the field..that was an absolute clinic.
"They were so focused on Saquon the chiefs completely forgot the team they played 2 years ago is back for revenge How you gonna forget Aj brown, Devontae smith, Dallas godert, Jalen hurts, our o line and our defense"
Shout out to the editing team for making the Chiefs look so good with only 23 yards in the first half
ugly scoreboard ugly halftime ugly game
Eagles only win in the Super Bowl to teams they lost!!! GO BIRDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I didn't care who won, but it is nice to have a new champion. This game seemed like karma after the Chiefs eked and lucked out wins all season. That eventually comes back to bite you."
We are the real America's team! Even if you're not an eagles fan. The bald eagles represents the nation.
No three peat
Now ready to order my Eagles Super Bowl 59 champs gear a hat and shirt from NFL Shop!
This Super Bowl was a whole disaster Patrick played horrible and kelce needs to retire but gotta give credit to the eagles And Jalen hurts for winning his first Super Bowl
"Mohommes not being carried by the refs and his defense, this what happens lol. Dudes actually been mid since 2022"
Game was over before the half
Eagles have the best lines best back and best receiver tandem.
THANK YOU SOOO MUCH NYG.
"The refs gave it their all ,oh sorry the chiefs"
Worse scoreboard display I've seen in a long time
"Bills and Ravens would have got clapped too, so take solace Buffalo and Baltimore fans."
I think Kansas City Chiefs losing and not getting a 3 Peat is more davastating than the Patriots losing and not getting a perfect season (18-1) the Dolphins already accomplished that but if the Chiefs would've won than they could've been the only 3 Peat Superbowl Champions.
"Well now that the season is over, Taylor dumps Kelce and writes a song and Andy Reid says, ""bummer, I thought we'd 3-peat and I could get the bundlerooskiedoo."
They were suffocating mahomes
They forgot to pay the refs
Game was boring felt like the Bucs vs chiefs game in 2021 im not a chief fan but wanted a competitive game
Thats what happens when the referees cant help you
No refs help. No 3 peat. No dynasty. Its all downhill from here on out for Chiefs.
"The face Hurts had at the beginning of the game: 100% dialed in. No way they were losing this time. Score is deceiving. The Chiefs got destroyed. And, my wife kept wondering why the dome was booing so much during non-action. It was from Taylor Swift being on the screen. They booed her everytime...lol"
"Kansas City Chiefs Fan here. Congratulations to the Eagles and their Fans. No excuses here, you just straight up beat us! See you all next year!"
Let me spell Eagles for y'all..... C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S
The dynasty is OVERRRRRR!
Thank You Eagles for stopping the three-peat!!!! FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!!
Barkley a beast glad he got a ring this year!
This lost will make Mahomes win more Super Bowls
referees actually did their job that night and did not let chiefs win. chiefs did not deserve to win!
Thank to the Eagle Team beat the chief because I dont like Mahome.
How did the Chiefs even make it to this game?
Taylor Swift officially has more Super Bowl appearances than Aaron Rodgers
Jason kelce wished he still played for the eagles and get revenge on his brother.
Chiefs lost by halftime
"RIGGED GAME, EAGLES PAID THE REFS!!!"
Chiefs forgot to pay the refs
Defensive clinic
Time to send the Chiefs to CHENGDU! Chengdu Chiefs
Wow that Eagles D line was insane today that was what helped the Birds win the game 6 sacks as Sweat was a beast 2.5 sacks he saved his best game for the last!
"I just hope both teams had fun, because thats what really matters"
JUSTICE!!!
Second best defensive Super Bowl performance ever
CONGRATULATION FOR THE EAGLES!!!
Well mahommes definitely not better than Brady after that
"I sincerely feel that this should have been Eagles v Bills. No matter what anyone says I will not concede, the Chiefs were bailed out for the AFC championship. No I do not believe the refs favored them I feel strongly there was just bad officiating done. The result of that was a team that was just not ready for the Eagles defense. Allen would have fought harder and plus who really wanted the Chiefs back in the Superbowl anyway they apparently did not deserve the appearance. : )"
Superbowl MVP - Philly D!
"Ordinarily it wouldn't surprise me that a team that was mid all season, which somehow made it to the super bowl, got trounced, but with the Chiefs it's somehow still a bit shocking. Congrats, Eagles!"
By the way mahomes is not overrated
Sad we lost but Saquon Barkley deserves a ring
"I don't like both teams, but at least these Stupid Chiefs lost. Tom brady will always be GOAT. Hope Mahomes get divorced."
The Chiefs lost and America won.
to got revenge eagles stop 3 peat like nba finals 2019
Hard to watch Swifties offense get shutdown by rookie DBs. Hopkins Brown Worthy Kelce. As expected Swifties defense can't stop top flight receivers.
I went from anxious (Will we score enough to win?!?) to greedy (Chiefs better not score a single point!)
"It's good to see that this was an evenly called game this time. But I will say this to the NFL. If us fans have to call out your bad refereeing and your poor and subjective enforcement of the rules, in order for you to call a clean game... To Roger Goodell and the NFL, you guys are still pathetic thugs, and your show pony Mahomes and your money maker Taylor Swift too, and also your referee union, all deserved to get destroyed tonight. I hope and pray that you guys never recover from this."
"Raiders fan here and I'm glad the eagles won. Last night I prayed to God for the eagles to win and he answered my prayer. I knew the chiefs wouldn't win cause a 3 peat in football is a curse, I tried telling people that but they didn't listen to me. Thank you eagles for putting the Kansas city cheats in their place."
Chiefs didnt belong. Honestly they shouldve lost all their 3 SBs too. Got lucky then and even to get to sb here. Honestly bills belonged here. 40-6 but Mahomes made it more respectable 40-22
"i can't wait to see the chiefs fans ""cry"" about the refs. just give them a taste of their own medicine and tell them to cope!"
The eagles DOMINATED the chiefs
Mahomes = Brady (from Temu)
Kenny Pickett won a superbowl before gta 6
The bad guys lost this one. woooo
Can't believe this is the scoreboard graphic they went with
Another birthday boy Cooper DeJean had his cake and eat it too as he got his present of a pick six!
"Why even keep the offense in just lost $1,300 because FanDuel dont wanna offer a cash out had Maholmes under 250 he gets 50 yards his last throw"
"Every team should take note as to a winning formula - big, tough defensive front line and tight secondary. But for a team that decided to focus on a running game, that backfired when your QB outruns your RBs. Still, the throwing game was very good and their defensive and offensive lines were fantastic."
Cooper DeJean carrying the culture on his back man...
"If the chiefs would of won , pretty much every fan in the NFL would boycott it forever"
THE EAGLES HAVE SAVED THE NFL!!!
Only if Mahomes had the Eagles defense on his side - that was brutal to watch. Patrick will definitely be back stronger.
As a Dallas fan..Lets Go Eagles? That's how its done Jerry!
"The Bills should of been in the SB, without the refs they would of never gone this far."
Yeah naw dont compare this fraud mahomes to GOAT brady cause even his losses weren't this embaressing.
Thank you eagles awesome Super Bowl
That scoreboard is AWFUL. Please don't use it next season FOX.
"I graduated high school, then 8 months later my team wins the Super Bowl a second time!!!!"
So glad I put a bet on the eagles to win it all at the beginning of the season. I knew as soon as they saquan they were in with a good shout even tho he was quiet today. He distracts other plays. Well in Philly
"That scoreboard is soulless I was genuinely pissed at the lack of creativity. The graphics were not too bad, but still!"
"K.C. was exposed as the imposters they have been all season. If the NFL and refs hadn't been promoting them all season, we would have seen a more competitive Super Bowl. And shame on the NFL for ending ""End Racism""."
"I am more of a soccer fan, but this as we say in soccer, a total domination by the eagles. Well done."
Refs got payed for eagles
That was a McNabbulous performance by the Eagles This is for McNabb
That pick 6 was euphoric. It was at that moment that you felt like the Eagles were going to take this home!
Bruh I lost $10 on this game
I don't know wanna hear from haters again. Superbowl mvp means more than regular season mvp. Hurts 59 mvp! Shows up on the biggest stage where it matters!
"Doesnt matter who won, either way, Im pissed off"
When the chiefs lose America wins
What an early good birthday present turn 47 on the 10 tommorrow yet being an Eagles fan this Super Bowl victory was an early present!
as much as i hate to say it the chiefs will be back
The Eagles slayed BOTH Brady and Mahomes
E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!!
WHOMEVER PASSED ON HURTS IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO AQUIRE HIM AND YOU DIDNT. You a STUPID. Shouldnt be a part of the NFL. You should be in the stands homie.
This game was a whole lotta BTA
"Green confetti hitting Tom Brady in the face was my favorite memory from 2018. I was really looking forward to seeing the same for Mahomes. Oh well, the win is satisfaction enough!"
HOW BOUT THEM EAGLEA
Complete dominance from the Eagles Knew they had it in them but completetly dominating the chiefs was not on the book CONGRATS TO PHILLY AND THE FANS!!!
"7:24 ""They haven't been able to do much against this formidable Chiefs def"" ... my guy, its 17-0 in the first half, wdym?"
Is this better than the ravens defense
"Refs did a decent job, a fair game. That's all I can ask for, so it made the game enjoyable"
Thos game was script.
GO BIRDS
The goat conversation was stupid before and its stupid now. Brady>>> side note but Im so happy for saquan
Eagles did all of us a favor
And we were supposed to believe that Mahomes was close to catching Brady
I'm on my way to the ticket counter tomorrow! Eagles for the win! RAH RAH
Kelce was not into the game .
"There are two takeaways from this SB: 1-the chiefs have been playing absolutely horrible mediocre football all season, just getting wins off of luck, phantom calls, and devil magic. It finally caught up to them 2-when you make a deal with the devil KC, the devil always gets the last laugh. In this case, you won the regular season, but the devils last laugh was making you lose the most important game. the devils hypnosis on the refs wore off. If your chiefs fan coworker doesnt show up for work tomorrow, its because they will be crying in a bathtub listening to a Taylor swift song"
Sweet sweet revenge for ALL teams
Put some respect on Jalen Hurts name !
The eagles really sacked Mahomes to kingdom come throughout the whole game.
Looks like chiefs partied for two weeks and didn't even practice
Congrats To The Eagles Winning Their Second SuperBowl Championship!!!! Kansas City Tried But Philadelphia Was Dominant!!!! Good Job For The Chiefs And Nice And Great Job For Philly!!!!
Wow who would have thought this the Eagles hit a 40 burger and blow the Chiefs out of New Orleans! Fly Eagles Fly!
"They were working so hard to stop 26, they forgot about the rest of the team."
"As a Bills fan, thank you Eagles for saving my beloved sport"
The GOAT phony convo came to a hault real quick hun?
Andy Reid has finally won a Super Bowl for The Eagles.
Meckhi Becton and Isaiah Rodgers who was suspended for a whole year actually won the Super Bowl..s/o
Biased commentators or what !
THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES WON THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2018 SECOND SUPER BOWL IN FRANCHISE HISTORY
Fly eagles fly
This reminds me of when the chiefs lost to the buccs
Thats what happens when you forget to pay the refs
"When I read an article that Eagles DC Vic Fangio is 0-8 against Mahomes, I thought he was long overdue to pull off his first payback. And boy did his Eagles delivered defensively."
"......... ,,, .. ... ....."
"As a bengals fan, I have nothing but respect for the Eagles. What a dominant team they have been this year. Deserved that ring 100%!"
Today is a great day not to be in KANSAS CITY.
I have a theory that the nfl wanted the eagles to win because everyone was catching on to the cheating for the Chiefs.
Wack Superbowl
"As a chiefs fan, I realized that when Tb12 is in the building the chiefs are 0-3 in the postseason."
Rigged entertainment
"Thank you, Philly!"
how they found 19 minutes of highlights is insane.
KC was so focused on shutting Saquon down that they forgot about the rest of the team!
Congratulations Eagles
"Proof that Chiefs, Mahomes, Reid, Kelce are all well overrated and majority of KC fans are 14yr old girls ( swifties) Brady never lost 2 SBs by 20pts or more Mahomes and Kelce also got in a fist fight in the locker room and Jones and Reid got in a heated argument in the locker room after this embarrassing loss.."
"Traditional football wins again! Great O-line, Above average QB play, Excellent running game and special teams, and most of all, suffocating defense. This is definitely the formula to keep beating teams with ""generational"" QBs."
"Tom Brady is really insufferable. The entire game he was either swallowing ""Patrick""s load or was talking how he's the greatest person to ever exist"
"Fly Eagles Fly! Super Bowl Champs, baby! I told you revenge is a dish best served cold."
This is for McNabb
"Chiefs: I am, Inevitable. Eagles: And I, Am, Iron Man."
The Chiefs are now 0-2 in the Super Bowl when Tom Brady is present.
Why was this not uploaded in 60 fps like the game itself was? Sports look bad at >30 fps
that second quarter was a massacre.
when you dont have the refs to carry you. dont wanna hear anymore brady-mahomes comparisons after this
Just like when the Bucs crushed the Chiefs.
Was not expecting this to be a blowout congrats to the eagles
"I was here, I predict Carolina Panthers winning Super Bowl 60."
Im gonna sleep like a baby tonight
"From all of America, thank you for blowing it <3"
There'll be no proposal for TayTay tonight lol
"SUPERBOWL CHAMPS!!! JALEN HURTS MVP!!! AND I LOVE THAT COMMERICAL...LOVE,HURTS HAHAHA TALK ABOUT OUR QB NOW!!! FLY EAGLES FLY!!!"
Kudos to the Eagles ending the Chiefs reign of terror
The eagles beat the script Congrats -cowboys fan
the scoreboard:
This is why Mahomes will always be number 2 all time
Travis Kelce 4 catches for 39 yards & 0 TD Must be the G.o.a.t on the TE position
Lets PLEASE be Honest...Patrick Mahomes Was RUNNING INTO Most of Those Sacks and Pressures Like He Always Does...Absolutely CLUELESS Around The Pocket...He Has Made The O Line Look MUCH Worse Than They Were Although They Were Bad
"Everyone's talking about the game but can we just take a moment to point out the absolutely disgusting scoreboard graphic this year? Its like the most generic, boring, ai-generated thing I've ever seen."
The Rams put up a better fight than the Chiefs. Congrats Eagles I knew you could handle them.
notice how bad Mahomes is when he get hits a lot
That scoreboard is atrocious
"As a cowboys fan, thank you Philly"
idk how many times imma watch this
I wont jump on mahomes too much because dude is a stud and an incredibly talented player who isnt going anywhere anytime soonbut I think we can end the talk about him surpassing Brady He just isnt on that level
FLY EAGLES FLY SUPER BOWL CHAMPOS BABYYYYYY
LeBron knows now who' s #33 lol
Who else saw the Jordan Hurts Haters commercial? They can't say nothing now. Barkley was getting stopped non stop. Hurts overcame adversity and put the offense on his back. MVP and 59 champion to slay the dragon!
We stopped the 3 peat. We got our revenge. Hurts wins superbowl MVP. Nick wins a Superbowl as a headcoach. And Saquon and dejean win on there birthdays. This is officially the greatest day of my life as an eagles fan. E-A-G-L-E-S
The Eagles out played the Refs
https://youtube.com/shorts/G6k4rCNInTw?si=7tGaJcWTp3A7Z22i
Goo Eagles
"Eagles just straight up exposed the worst 15-win team of all time. On behalf of everyone outside of the KC area, thank you Eagles!"
Got our payback against Brady and Mahomes.
We got Patrick MaChoke again before gta 6
"Thank you Eagles, and Congrats"
LET'S GOOOO EAGLES! PHILLY REALLY CRUSHED THE CHIEFS!
RIGGED
What a great game
Eagles show winning football begins at the trenches.
They should've bundled and saved some more touchdownrooskis lol loser
I gotta say as a Washington fan I'm glad the eagles won this super bowl man they deserved it after how good they been during the season and im glad someone finally beat mahomes GO EAGLES this was a great game Congratulations
I guess the Chiefs didn't pay the refs enough
Mahomes play very bad. hold the ball too loooong and got sacked.many times.
Mahomes stat-padding in a blowout just like Dak Prescott
After all of the lucky games the chiefs won to get to this point: this was so so so satisfying
The refs in the beginning was tryna do the eagles dirty even Tom Brady said wtf they doing let em play
Who's The Goat now Stephen A?
"Brady's legacy is intact. That being said, there will never, ever, and I repeat EVER be another Thomas Matthew Patrick Brady III again! NEver!!! Also, Kelce is retiring and mahomes is now a bench warmer next season. It's over for mahomes."
Can the media now shut down the Mahomes is the Goat talk? Its been absurd.
Goo birds
"The Eagles didn't just beat the Chiefs. They beat the NFL. They beat the referees. They beat Roger Goodell and Taylor Swift. They just won their second super bowl against another dynasty. Congratulations, Philadelphia."
Saquan was the decoy we needed. Not his best this game but he gave openings for our receivers who have been blocked forever this season giving Jalen to open pass he needed! This whole organization is the strongest I've seen ever! LETS GO BIRDS!!
"FOR ALL THE ATHIESTS OUT THERE, THIS IS PROOF THAT GOD IS REAL!! GO EAGLES"
Thank you Eagles. Ya save the NFL
I dont want to ever hear any mahomes Brady debate ever again. Brady will always be the GOAT
"A moment of silence for all cuckoo conspiracy crybabies who have thought the refs favored to Chiefs to win every single game...except this one...for what reason, we don't know...must be Trump's fault, he was there. Bunch of schizophrenic NFL fannies...."
Abysmal performance from the Chiefs tonight.
Most boring SB ever?
Congratulations Eagles. Do not become the thing you came to destroy.
"Just like Rocky defeating Clubber Lang, Eagles came back and beat the Chiefs. Congrats, Eagles!"
"I'm not even an eagles fan, but I'm just as excited as one! Thanks for saving the NFL for me Eagles"
Eagles
THE EAGLES DOMINATED THE WHOLE GAME
never been so happy to see a man in the ground
"Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Bill Belichick were all at the game, let that sink in"
SMACKED AND SLAUGHTERED. EAGLES NFL CHAMPIONS
GG Eagles! So glad KC got dominated. KC is the most overrated team in the NFL!
Refs need to be fired as none of them helped the Chiefs tonight
Mahomes throwing the first Chiefs touchdown while down 34 is like Chris Paul hitting a huge three to cut the lead to 42
Aside from the saints winning Super Bowl 44 this is my favorite Super Bowl! Congratulations eagles!!!!!! Fly eagles fly! WhoDat!!!!!!
Mahomeboy's grandad fought for his life for this
Congratulations on witnessing one of the most boring football games ever
All my eagles fans since day one. Now we show class!!!
I guess kelce aint proposing tonight
This was the most boring game of the season
Fly Eagles Fly! What a game.
Chief shouldve played better first second third quarter we choked ourselves but again theres next year
2nd ring in franchise history. The redemption ring
LETS GOOOOO EAGLES
Chiefs fan here. We tried to tell y'all the nfl isn't rigged. Just because you're team isn't good doesn't mean it's rigged
The bills should have been here today. Would have put up a much better fight
Too big to rig the Eagles completely dominated. Not an Eagles fan but Im thankful they shut down the NFL favoring Chiefs reign.
Montana and Brady are intouchable dont ever bring Mahomes in the mix All time Bad performance that twice now in the super bowl in his prime. He cant be no goat in my book NFL fans won tonight with the Eagles enough of the chiefs and no swifties anymore Bye love it
Every time I hear that phrase DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS I'ma look at this
Not too hurt by this loss. Mahomes will be in many more of these. We got our back to back SB wins. Im happy for that more than anything. It will be interesting to see what the future brings. Go Chiefs.
What a game.
"Congratulations, Philly"
What happened? Did the Chiefs Transaction to the refs declined????
Chat the real game score before the chiefs started stat padding is 40-6
Its so satisfying that the refs betrayed the Chiefs lmao
The fact of the Eagles won this game without saquon Barkley doing a lot is amazing hats off to the Eagles defense for forcing three turnovers
"Saquon wasnt great, but Eagles defense was elite"
Vic Fangio deserves all the flowers for his defense.
Refs helped the eagles smh
I was looking for taylor swift the whole game
even the refs couldn't save the chiefs in this one.
"Wild that the eagles won! Congratulations! I hear all the people outside, the helicopters, fireworks and celebrating"
Chiefs were frauds. Everyone knew it. We finally get the game that shows the world they are frauds.
"The Chiefs ENTIRELY sold out to stop Barkley, believing hurts wouldnt get it done. How wrong they were I cant believe they didnt change their strategy at halftime. Youre getting blown out and you keep dedicating your whole scheme to one player? Just trying to lose."
The Giants should fire EVERYBODY.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! Good day to pick Eagles and the over!!! Chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Chingggg!!!
I'm so proud of you Jalen Hurts I've been a fan from Bama days congratulations on your super bowl win and MVP you are the man let the haters keep hating!!!
Let's go eagles super bowl champions
It seemed at moments the refs where upset they couldn't help
The Eagles win The Superbowl GO BIRDS!!!!!!!!
"As a 49ers fan, this was just about the second worst matchup in a Super Bowl (Chiefs vs Seahawks wouldve been the worst) but thank you Eagles for denying the Chiefs a 3 peat and shutting up all the Swifties"
Congrats to my Birds!!!! Our defensive line was outstanding!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE EAGLES ! ALL SEASON PHILADELPHIA WAS THE BEST TEAM IN THE NFL!
Jalen Hurts is a winner. End of story
Finally all the Chiefs luck they've had this year comes to an end
The Detroit Lions are winning the Super Bowl in California this year
"If this did not display how rigged the NFL is, I don't know what to say.."
Yall the Super Bowl LIX halftime stats were more closer than we realize: Eagles: 24 points Chiefs: 23 yards Crazy close numbers there
Thank you Eagles for saving America!!!! Rams fan.
"First things first is going to be fire, cant wait for the banner drops."
It looks like the torch has been passed to Jalen HURTS to continue excellence. But do you trust the Eagles with the COMMANDERS. LIONS and RAMS on the rise ?
It's time for Dodgers baseball !!!!
I can't imagine that only a year ago the eagles got so much hate...
Eagles got their revenge! Well earned!
What a blowout.
Am i the only one who cant wait to hear Nick Wright try to spin this about Mahomes still being the greatest ever???
Havent seen anyone mention the horrific looking scoreboard my god its bad
If there's not a chunk of dislikes then that means America enjoyed this game.
What are all the rigged people gonna say now
"Allen wins MVP and Chiefs brutally lose the 3peat opportunity. Wouldve preferred a Bills Super Bowl win, but overall this was a solid Super Bowl weekend."
Crazy how fast the chiefs were able to make the scoreboard look like theyre good at the game
I wish they had shown Taylor Swift's face when they were getting blown out
Fly Eagles Fly 2 super bowl wins for the eagles
I can have joy for football again
Thank you Eagles. I will watch nfl next season.
EAGLES ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eagles are team america
This game was over at halftime. Mahomes padded his stata to save his legacy loool.
Man mahomes was horrible
If Travis Kelce retires then Taylor Swift is gone forever. Thanks Eagles
Chiefs got exposed with out the refs they were never that good this season every game they got carried
CHAMPIONS. REMEMBER THIS DAY
Terrible Super Bowl
Brady is still the
Best Super Bowl ever. Cry Mahomes cry!
I guess the chiefs didnt pay the ref
MVP to Hurts for taking the spotlight away from Mahommes and the celebrity crowd!
The eagles got their revenge just like 7 years ago against the patriots.
"When the Refs robbed Philly of that 4th & 2 with a bogus OPI, that lit a fire in Philly's Soul. They put their foot down and never let up. Congrats to The Eagles from a Patriots Fan. ."
Wasn't expecting this game to be a blowout. Congratulations to Jalen for getting his first ring
"Another NFL season in the Books can't too bad the Chiefs did not complete the three peat , GG Eagles"
The Eagles were on
Happy for Saquon as a Giants fan although I am beyond angry at my own front office and ownership.
Congrats to Philly... What a season! A few hiccups along the way but they were pretty dominant from start to finish this year. Well-deserved. ANYBODY but them CHEATS! Sorry I meant Chiefs
LETS GO EAGLES When the refs are playing for the chiefs THATS HOW IT TURNS OUT BABY
Fly Eagles Fly!
When the Chief's Vemo payment bounces: The Game.
"I am a Patriots fan, and I'm still pissed that the Eagles beat us 7 years ago in Super Bowl 52, but I'm putting all that aside for today, and from the bottom of my heart I say thank you thank you thank you. You made every football fan besides Chiefs fans happy today."
Eagles got their lick back on The Patriots AND The Chiefs. Were Dynasty Slayers! Go Birds!
Win by inches lose by miles.
Eagles got lucky they didnt have to play against thr lions or bills. What a snooze fest
hope people didn't bet away their homes thinking it was rigged for the Chiefs 3peat
I dont even watch much football but I knew enough to know the eagles were hiding the bible when they played this game
"whoever thought that scoreboard design was good, you need to be tested"
I think Kansas City Chiefs losing and not getting a 3 Peat is more davastating than the Patriots losing and not getting a perfect season (18-1) the Dolphins already accomplished that but if the Chiefs would've won than they could've been the only 3 Peat Superbowl Champions.
"Chiefs lose, America Wins!"
"Hopefully next year, neither team will be in Superbowl 60."
So is the NFL still scripted?
Kobe would be proud RIP
Glad refs failed to help chiefs win.
"as Jalen Hurts said: ""DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS"" !!!"
Not a fan of both team but that pass interference by Aj Brown early in the first Quarter started the refs to favor the eagles because it was very obvious they were rooting for the Chiefs Congrats Eagles fans
Reffs couldn't help the cheifs cos the world was watching!
"If Kyle Shanahan was the coach of the Eagles, the Chiefs definitely would have came back."
It's amazing what can happen when the refs aren't paid off.
Super Bowl
"If you think the Superbowl logo is ugly, the the new fox scorebug is uglier."
"As a Niners fan, thank you Eagles. Well deserved"
W
I'm so happy I don't know what to say!!!!! Jalen Hurts shut down all of his haters tonight who criticize him for not throwing the football enough with a vintage Jalen Hurts performance. Tonight Jalen Hurts went 17/22 for over 221 YDs tonight and 2 TD's and 1 INT. Our defense was lights out. We were locked in on defense from the beginning of the game. We did an awesome job of shutting down Patrick Mahomes and containing him the whole game!! Defensively we managed to get stops when we needed to an offensively we were locked in from jump street! We played an amazing game!!! Congrats to my Eagles!!!!
"at 34 v0 down, game over , even tb cant ssved them"
Earlyy
"Dominating performance by the Eagles if you dont win the line scrimmage, you dont win if you dont stop your opponent, you dont win defense wins championships those fundamentals will never change in the game of football the game was over at halftime congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles and their fans."
the rush 4 and cover 2 of Todd Bowles
Chiefs had no business even being here this year lol
"What an absolute comeback, from their late season collapse last season to winning it all"
The Refereeagles won this game.
Fly Eagles Fly
49ers and eagles were robbed of having 2 superbowls because the refs. Refs stayed out of it today lol
Ran out of dark magic
THREE PEAT WHAT ?????
The only thing bad about this Superbowl is the new fox scorebug
Thank you Phily congrats on winning the Superbowl
NEVER say Mahomes is on Brady's level again. 0-2 vs TB12 in the playoffs. Blown out in 2 different Superbowls.
Eagles defense is now up there with some of the greatest of all time. They shut down one of the most prolific QBs in NFL history when he was going for a 3 peat. No one else can claim that.
What a waste. The chiefs beat the bills cause of some bs calls and the chiefs go on to play like that?? Pathetic
"Chiefs lose, America Wins"
"On behalf of football fans across the world, I would like to thank Patrick Mahomes for saving us from a chiefs 3 peat"
We love you chiefs
"Congratulations to Canadian, Sydney Brown and Australian, Jordan Mailata"
cant wait for nick wrights reaction
"Eagles blowout made Chiefs look like the Vikings. I know your pain, Chiefs' fans. Congrats, Philly!"
"This superbowl was just the defintion of mid for me. The game wasn't entertaining, the commercials didn't stick out, and the halftime show just felt boring"
2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
No more Jalen Hate. This guy is a CHAMPION! Fly Eealges Fly!
"To think the last time the Eagles were in this building, they were in danger of falling to 1-2"
That's how you gotta beat them. You gotta Play mistake free Ball and keep the Refs from saving them
You can doubt the Chiefs. You can dislike the Chiefs. You can disrespect the Chiefs. But the Chiefs got dealt with.
All of sudden it's not scripted huh?
Needed binoculars to see Taylor swift tonight thank you eagles
"Fly Eagles ""Legends Killers"" Fly. Great Job By Our QB."
"Non existent running game for the Chiefs. Judging by all the reactions, this is as popular a super bowl win as whenever the Patriots were beaten."
I already know that Lombardi is going to Philly the moment the Eagles Won against the Rams and the Bills lost to the Chiefs...The refs help to the Chiefs gives the Eagles a Favor for winning the Superbowl...So to the refs that helped the Cheifs winning games i sincerely THANK YOU
I'm glad the cheifs & the swifties got destroyed & buffalo bills fans feel the same way
Thank you eagles from all of America and Texans fans !!! Fly eagles fly
Fly Eagles FLYYYYY E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLESSSSS GO BURDS BABYYYY WE WHOOPED KC NO MORE CRINGE CHIEFS
Thank you Eagles. Youve saved us all.
"Sorry Chiefs fans, but this time y'all cant use the "" We WeRe MiSsInG oUr WhOlE o-LiNe"" excuse like in the Bucs Super Bowl game. The Eagles just straight up molested them and Mahomes. Great job Birds and congrats on being Super Bowl 59 Champs!"
"Man, that Devonta Smith TD was the biggest F U I've ever seen in the Super Bowl, Eagles showed no mercy in this game and I loved every second of it"
Im happy to see saquan getting what he deserves sorry for spelling his name wrong
Worst Blowouts of the season 1 Chiefs vs Eagles Super Bowl 59 2 Chiefs vs Broncos 3 Lions vs Cowboys 4 Vikings vs Rams NFC Wild Card
Eagles save the NFL world
3peat killers
Will the Eagles beat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl? How badly will the Eagles beat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl?
The Eagles stopped a potential 3-peat from happening.
The Eagles did the entire country some good tonite. No one wanted to see the Chiefs three peat. Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley deserve this the most salute to both of them. As for the Chiefs Mahomes now 3-2 in Super Bowls both blowouts and Kelce didnt show up at all he probably gonna retire he look like he didnt even want to be out there. Gonna be a long offseason for Reid.
TB12
Shout out to the NFL for only showing Taylor Swift ONCE
"The refs helped the chiefs all year to get to the superbowl. Once there, they got exposed."
thank you Jalen Hurts
I wonder if the eagles did some voodoo magic to win
"Even though the Chiefs fell short this time, they still made NFL history by being the first team ever to achieve a superbowl appearance after two consecutive superbowl wins."
Happy birthday Cooper Dejean!
As a bears fan thank you eagles.
Chiefs fan and I'm here for the NFL is rigged comments!
Most boring script ever
Chiefs vs Refs and Eagles
This Chiefs team reminded me of the 2015 Carolina Panthers beat up on teams all season just to choke in the Superbowl now we dont have to hear Chiefs fans mouths the whole season
"The massacre Bowl. This game showed that Chiefs and their style of play is OVERRATED and PREDICTABLE. Mahomes runs, slides or they go for Kelce and that's it. Mahomes has never been good like Bradshaw, Elway, Manning, Jackson or Brady. Much of the merit of the dynasty was due to the runners (Pacheco for example). It is one of the worst Super Bowl's in terms of the quality of the game. But it served to show that Mahomes is not Tom Brady. Only him made you think that there was no impossible game."
"You gotta feel bad for the Chiefs tho, they were missing their best players The refs"
Swifities in shambles.... I love it!
taylor cant find her bf the wholetime
To see that my team The Eagles were the ones to stop the Chiefs......amazing!
E-A-G-L-E-S SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!
That eagles defense is something else. They never took their foot off the gas pedal. Straight dominant. I think thats the end of the dynasty. Someone else is coming out the AFC next year.
TO BIG FOR THE REFS TO RIG!! Let's Goooo!!
Kobe would be so proud.
This the worst Superbowl
"Doesn't matter what team you root for, we can all agree that the new fox scoreboard is terrible."
What a good win. Eagles the champion Im so proud of this team.
FLY EAGLES FLY YOUVE ACHIEVED YOUR VICTORY!!! E A G L E S EAGLES!!!
NFL fans werw robbed of a good superbowl 2 best teams Lions and bills werent even in it. Was a snooze fest
The Taylor Swift era has ended. God himself favored the Chiefs. Honestly top 3 superbowl. The universe is saved. Saquads deserved this win after suffering from the Giants. Debate is over. Mahomes is NOT the goat. Their is no conversation. Refs favored Chiefs in first half & it showed. Then the refs gave up. Mahomes with the frown in the 2nd quarter is proof he was mentally gone & gave up. Thank you Eagles for literally saving the universe. Chiefs success last year & this year was all because of Taylors crazy cult fans spending $1 BILLION!!!
The Eagles' defensive line was dominant. Jalen Hurts winning the MVP is huge. Dominant performance !
"Oh how the Mighty Chiefs have fallen. Sorry, not sorry."
"The ""rigged"" and ""scripted"" idiots are suspiciously quiet."
WE FINALLY WON AFTER 7 YRS
FYI Tom Brady never lost by more than one score in the Super Bowl
RIP to all of the people who said they aren't watching the SB this year. It's all scripted though. No different than the WWE.
GO ELGLES
Good ol fashioned Super Bowl blowout
As a chiefs fan gg we didnt have an ol line but its fine we will be back ggs eagles you deserved it
Burrow played a better D-Line with a worse O-Line and still made a game out of it. No excuses
HAHAHA THIS CHIEFS CANNOT BEAT PATRIOTS DYNASTY!! THANK YOU EAGLES!! AND CONGRATS!! IM GLAD REFS NOT HELPING CHIEFS!!
Just pure satisfaction.
Domination good job eagles
"Only 1 Blitz the entire game, Eagles 4 rushes is DOMINANT"
Watching the Chiefs getting man handled was a gift
LFG!!!!!!!!!!
Hurts has officially proven his doubters wrong. Made them look like clowns. Source: I was a doubter. This clown doubts no more.
THIS PROVES BRADY IS GOAT!!!! he beat mahomes and he got thrashed no more goat talk ESPN
we dem boys fr
Super Bowl Champions. SMD
"What a birthday gift for Cooper DeJean and Saquan Barkley. Congrats Philly, and also Xavier Worthy balled out this game, he's going to be a real problem for defenses in the future"
KC threw that game.
Worst part about this super bowl? The new scoreboard.
That freaking o line
Idc Brown and Smith the best wr duo rn
"Both the refs and the dark magic overlord betrayed the Chiefs tonight. Thats just goes to show you that cheaters never postor, and that defenese truly wins Championships. And also, Jalen Hurts has now joined Burrow and Brady as the only QBs to defeat Mahomes in the postseason."
That Hurts touchdown to Smith reminded me of Joe Montana in his Super Bowl at the same stadium. Black 59 Razor!
spanked
Kudos to the eagles who are a great team and deserved the win. Well be back. Chiefs just didnt perform today. 3 turnovers will lose any game.
"The Eagles has Accomplished their Vengeance from Super Bowl 57. There goes the Chiefs attempted 3-peat, too bad. No Refs will be saving them this time."
this is what happens to the chiefs when the refs call a fair game
"Bills fans getting to watch the Chiefs get destroyed in the Super Bowl while simultaneously losing their argument that the AFCCG was rigged so the Chiefs could 3-peat is the ultimate ""I've won, but at what cost?"""
Every Giants player gets traded to win the Super Bowl Giants will be there to win next when they get a qb and more offensive and defensive weapons
When the refs arent allowed to help the chiefs because of the backlash
So the NFL isnt rigged
saquon deserved this!
Thank you eagles for saving football
Amazing game from the Eagles start to finish
Best game ever! Thank you eagles for saving us!!!!
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on beating the Chiefs!!! A well deserved championship!!! All of America is happy!!!
Eagles defense dominated on all cylinders and the offense despite Barkley not being able to do much hurts brown n smith all did their thing
2024 Philadelphia might be one of the top 5 superbowls teams of all timeThey put up 55 points in the NFC championship and then dropped 40 on Mahomes and the chiefs. That team will go down in history
What a phenomenal defensive performance by the Eagles! They shut down the Chiefs and proved they can win even against a team that always seems to have the refs on their side. Absolute dominance!
Worthy with the sneakiest 157yd 2 touchdown game ever
Most watchable Super Bowl in years tbh
will ALWAYS LOVE MY CHIEFSCONGRATS EAGLES
"No 3 peat, 4 peat, 5 peat. Mahomes has to start all over"
#TooBigToRig
"Chiefs arent as good as they think, with the refs calling a fair game, Chiefs were dog walked!"
Did anyone feel the the game moved fast.maybe faster than usual?!!! Congrats Eagle Nation!!!
"Defense wins games, nothing can be done if QB doesn't have time to do anything! GO EAGLES!!!"
PHILADELPHIA PENNSYLVANIA
THE CHREFS HAVE FALLEN!
LETS GO EAGLES
This was the Eagles best game of the season dare I say it even more of an impressive performance and standout then the Conference championship game. The Eagles dominated on all facets of the game and did not let up at all times. FLY EAGLES FLY
"As a niners fan, Jalen hurts might have had the best game of his career. I know the stats dont show 400yds and 5 tds but just his anticipation and decision making was on point! Jalen deserves the mvp. Congratulations philly"
YES
Fly eagles fly
NEVER COMPARE MAHOMES WITH BRADY AGAIN.
Baltimore/Buffalo would have given a better fight.
Super Bowl 59 is proof being at the top doesnt automatically owe you a super bowl ring. Better luck next time Chiefs.
"Eagles won it for all of us. Having said that, I think the D should have gotten the MVP. They were unreal."
Eagles wanted the smoke after what happened in Super Bowl 57.
"As a Jets fan, congratulations Eagles !!! Im so proud of yall for overcoming the haters and doubters and slaying the Chiefs dynasty. Thank you for stopping the 3-peat attempt. Congrats Jalen, Saquon, the Eagles offense and defense for getting a ring!!!"
"Incoming ""It was rigged"" comments from casuals. (Even though Eagles had more penalties and that AJ Brown call (1:22) in the first drive was literal proof it was still in the Chiefs favors. lol)"
"The Eagles defense was awesome, I was rooting for a shut out."
This nfl scorebug is the worst ever
This is what we all knew. The Chiefs are a 9-8 team without the refs helping them.
I can tell you one thing about Jalen Hurts... its that he's a WINNER
JALEN IS LEGIT STOP THE HATE
THE EAGLES ARE SUPER BOWL WORLD CHAMPIONS
LETS ALL LAUGH AT THE CHEIFS
Chiefs are actually the most overrated team oat
"Hey, the Chiefs contained Barkley at least"
Kenny Pickett really got a ring before Josh Allen
"As a pats fan, I couldnt be happier! LFG!!!"
Karma for screwing the Bills
I am so proud of eagles
"I dont even think Mahomes is even better than Len Dawson anymore,let alone Tom freaking Brady."
Mahomes will NEVER be Tom Brady 0-2 vs Brady in the playoffs 3-2 in the SB. Awful in another SB today before he started to statpad. Blown out in his SB losses. Brady was never blown out in any of his SB losses and they always came down to the final minutes.
This is officially the best day of my life
chiefs collapse when it comes to playing against a good team without the refs
"If you are ever feeling useless, just remember Kenny Pickett now has more rings than Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, JaMarr Chase, Justin Jefferson, Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry, and TJ Watt combined"
"Lamar haters owe Lamar an apolofie, Machines 3 turnovers. Lamar jackson 2 turnovers lose by 2."
the 15 win cures still lives on
As a Saints fan. FLY EAGLES FLY!!!
There will be no 3-peat.
ORDER HAS BEEN RESTORED! DOWN GO THE CHIEFS TKO
THERE WILL BE NO 3-PEAT!!!
Fly Eagles Fly!!!
What happens when the refs dont pick who wins every 50/50 call
This is who the Chiefs really are when the whole world is watching and the refs can't bail them out!
What can I say its payback time
Tom Brady's presence in the booth spooked Mahomes
THE EAGLES ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS
Eagles defeated KC's black magic grip on the refs
Pre game : usa vs chiefs+refs After halftime : go chiefs!! Show something
3-PEAT? MORE LIKE DEFEAT!!!!
but but but the chiefs were suppost to 3 peat and mahomes was better than brady don't ever say mahomes better than brady hahahahahahah swift what happpen hahahahahahahahaha kelce thought he was better than gronk hahahahaha
NFL ARE THE REAL CHAMPS.
Words cannot describe how satisfying this is for everyone thats not a chiefs fan
wait? A game where the refs didnt bail out the chiefs?
This game was the most therapeutic one could ever get.
Seriously why is no 1 talking about that scoreboard?
Sweet revenge!!! Feels so good we have been waiting for this for over 2 years!!! Already ready for next year and ready to go back to back!!!! GO BIRDS E A G L E S EAGLES!!!
Thank you Eagles for not allowing the 3-cheat.
Congratulations Eagles! You guys played outstanding! Well deserved. Fly high bird bros!
"It's okay cheifs fans, they'll probably win it again next year."
UH OH NO 3 PEAT
"chiefs lost, i won $500 on a football pool......what a way to top off the NFL season"
"This was an absolute beat down by Philly, defense played the game of their lives. Chiefs O-Line fell apart and they got blown out."
Whos here in 2025
What a dominant game from the Eagles. Happy birthday to Saquon Barkley and Cooper Dejean. The 3 peat curse strikes again. Congratulations Eagles!
DONT EVER COMPARE MAHOMES TO BRADY AGAIN
I'm honestly happy the Eagles won. They helped stop the Chiefs from having a three-peat!
MAGNIFICENT SEASON BIRDGANG
I miss the old fox scoreboard
Hurts was incredible tonight his running and throws tonight were elite he was on another level Really the whole team was on another level Im so happy my Eagles are 2025 SuperBowl Champions GoBirds
I have a feeling were gonna see A LOT of Chiefs fans start disappearing after tonight
Cant wait to hear how nick wright takes this lol
"Dear Eagles, as a Niners fan thank you for humbling this cocky franchise, fanbase, and all the Swifties. You showed Mahomes what Purdy had to deal with last year and I couldnt be more proud. See what happens when the refs arent saving you? Great game Eagles"
amazing
"thank god the chiefs lost. im really tired of this taylor swift proppy and the zebras ruining games with every game the chiefs play in. also, dont ever put mahomes in the same convo with brady ever again. brady would never let this game be this terrible."
Cooper DeJean is Him.
"As a Packers fan, I feel less bad about losing to Philly with them winning the SB. Hell of a defense and thank you for keeping KC from a three peat."
Eagles finished what they started.
Lets Go EAGLES
NEVER compare The GOAT Tom Brady to mahomes ever again!
FLY EAGLES FLY
Kelsey was gonna propose if kc won
I love seeing the chugs get hammered
The superbowl we deserved
Eagles & Jalen HURTS The Chiefs Three Peat Chance!
The black magic has been conquered
"Im not an eagles fan, but you gotta give it to hurts, he shows up in the Super Bowl"
"Wow What a Super Bowl. Well played by Jalen Hurts and the rest. As an Eagles fan, Im grateful for everything that this team had accomplished. Like, from losing to a team in the Super Bowl two years ago only to come back and bite them is just inspirational. Now, we beat both Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes, what more could I ask for"
"I was at work, checked the score at halftime like"
So proud of my boys. Congratulations
Catch the L swifties! No 3 peat for you!!
Jalen Hurts has done it.
What an absolutely dominating performance by the eagles. WHAT. A. GAME. So happy for the entire team. What a fantastic team we had this year. FLY EAGLES FLY
hell no the refs made so many bad calls and the chiefs o-line didnt do nothing
Yall forgot to pay the referees
Sorry Taylor Swift but your team and your man ain't getting the 3 peat . I'm amazed every eagle fan booed at her .
"The revenge came and good won... Fly Eagles, Fly..."
Where does Jalen Hurts Rank in Eagle QB history?
Technically the packers won 3 straight championships in the mid 1960s
WHOOOO TOM BRADY YOUR CAREER IS SAFE!!
Eagles saved football
Happy KC lost day everyone!
"Kenny Picket really got a super bowl before Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, Jared Goff, Brock Purdy, and majority of all the starting qbs. Welcome to 2025"
Most satisfying NFL game in a long time. Eagles molly whopped the chiefs. Patrick Mahomes isn't the goat.
The champs are HERE!!
"Well i guess you can say that the Chiefs can ""shake it off"" it must ""Hurt"" them pretty bad. Oh well great performance by the Eagles!"
Blowout in the Big Easy! Revenge of the Birds! Thwart of the Threepeat! Happy Birthday to Saquon Barkley and Cooper DeJean! It Hurts so good for Jalen Hurts to win MVP!
"Chiefs offense played like they played all season! If it wasn't for super biased calls, they wouldn't have made it to the playoffs."
Philly better of greased those light poles
Fun Fact: Eagles have never lost a superbowl with Carson Wentz on the sidelines
EAGLES REDEEMED THEM SELFS
"Eagles not only did it for Philly, but also for the rest of the league"
It was great watching the Queefs dynasty crumble. They were always a product of great calls and no-calls.
"NFL: We need to follow the script. Eagles: No, I don't think I will."
Gooo BIRDS!! Cant wait to party down broad st this week! Ill admit i was critical on jalen this year but he proved me wrong and played his tail off in the biggest game!! CHAMPS
CRY SWIFTIES CRY ON THE TOUR OF MISERY BYE SWIFTIES BYE KELCE RETIRES MAYBE SING IT LOOOW DONT BE SHY AND WATCH MAHOMES CRRYY MY SWIFTIES MY GET OUT OF NEW ORLEEEAANS
Someone get edp a cupcake
Guess Kelce had to go ahead and holster that engagement ring eh?
nfl is rigged guys... or maybe the eagles are just THAT GOOD
"Satan has been defeated, in the home of the Saints at that. How poetic"
Moment of silents to all the people who had Saquan going over 100 yards tdy.......
I KNOW Jason AND Fletch are groveling over the fact that they retired TOO EARLY GG FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!!
If you reading this watch FTF tmmr gonna be crazy
People actually compared Kelce & Mahomes to Brady & Gronk lol
40-22 doesnt tell you just how much of a blowout it was
Eagles saved America. Thank you very much Philly!
The fact there's 7 Alabama players and defeated the chiefs is what made it better for Alabama fans lol. Edit: Rumors say Taylor Swift is breaking up with Travis Kelce.
"As a D1 chiefs hater, this is the greatest Super Bowl Ive ever watched in my life"
The Eagles' second SB title in franchise history. The Chiefs' first postseason loss since the 2021 AFC Championship game.
"Patricia Mahomo lost, America won. All is well. Also, what is PSP Pumpkin Slice Palpatine doing there?"
Jalen Hurts now has as many rings as Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees
"I think I speak for everyone here, thank you Eagles for stopping the three-peat and saving the NFL!"
As a cowboy and jets fan respect to the eagles on a amazing season well done and i am so happy for saquon he deserves this ring for how the little giants treated him
22-40 dang eagle saved America very much
Lets Go Eagles Jalen hurts got his lick back
So why is no 1 talking about that scoreboard what the heck?!
At least the Commanders lost to the champs
"This is the real Kansas City Chiefs without the refs, this game showed the chiefs and how bad they are"
Told ya so!!!
Thank you Philadelphia Eagles -Fledgling Giants fan
Congrats to the eagles well deserved they played their heart outs for the city of Philly. What a defense!
Nick Wright calling off of work tmmr
Rams did a better job then the Chiefs smh sad.
Chiefs cant believe they didnt have the refs in their back pocket all night
Death of the 3 peat. Jalen Hurts did it! 1st Black QB to win the SUPER BOWL on a Non Native American Team.
"KC fans, Turn your tv off."
Williams Wilson Mahomes Hurts
The Chiefs without Plot Armor:
Andy Reid finna head back to Philly
"gg eagles well deserved, Go Chiefs Kingdom!"
CHAMPS EAGLES CHAMPS!!!
"On behalf of America, thank you Eagles. You saved our country tonight by preventing a Chiefs three-peat."
Jalen Hurts silenced his doubters
Lets go Eagles!!!!
"NO Super Bowl 3 peat for u kansas city chiefs, bye-bye your going home empty handed. This was the chiefs most embarrassing loss in the super bowl ."
Complete dominance Mahomes couldnt even be himself and they had to answer for the eagles. 3 peats are difficult
"This is how the Chiefs played all season, they just didnt have the refs helping them this time."
Sheesh
I dont want to hear anyone disrespect Jalen hurts again
The Eagles saved America!!
"I still think the NFL is rigged, I just think the point was to get the Chiefs to the Super Bowl, to ensure viewership from Taylor Swift fans."
Was lookin for this then it popped up 1 mins lets go
This is the best philly team oat
Super bowl 59 CMON apple halftime was great!
Re-do the game but with the Buffalo Bills
All of a sudden theres no script? Lmao yall gotta make up your minds
All the bought-and-paid-for referees in the world couldn't help this pathetic KC team! The Eagles were leagues above them. What a total and complete DOMINATION!
"The pressure by the media, fans around the entire country, former players, commentators and celebrities put enough pressure on the refs to call a fair game. That's the result. The KC Cheats were average ALL SEASON and shouldn't have even been to the SB. Eagles EXPOSED them."
Great game for the Eagles as the Bengals fan you guys earned this thing
The collapse of the Chiefs dynasty really couldnt have happened in a more spectacular fashion.
The bills should have been here much better Super Bowl probably in my opinion
"As a huge chiefs fan- congrats to the eagles- they outplayed us all game and totally deserve this win, the chiefs luck was gonna run out eventually, so ggs, also cooper dejaun is an incredible player so props to him"
So thankful to have watched my team get 2 rings in my lifetime.
"they played a real team and got showed up, simple."
I wanna see Gillie dance to blow the whistle now
"As a neutral fan, thank you Philadelphia for preventing a 3-Peat, overcoming refs and denying another Swift Bowl"
Tom Brady didn't have a super bowl blowout loss
Thank you Eagles
"Hurts got benched at Alabama, turned his career around at OU. Was doubted since day one as a pro, and is now Super Bowl mvp."
"Chiefs got bailed out by the refs, close games, and all those fans chirped just to show this in the superbowl. They truly fell for the devil's work"
"This win is for Bill Bergey, R.I.P."
Mahomes saw Brady in attendance and choked
Yesss Eagles winn. Chiefs and taylor swift story is overrrrr
This game was honestly karma for all of the atrocious ways the chiefs won games they shouldve lost. Balance in the universe is finally restored. THANK YOU FOR SAVING FOOTBALL PHILLY!
Fly Eagles Fly
Eagles got their Revenge
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EAGLES!!!!!!!
Eagles but BTA on the field and in Philly
Where it starts is where it ends
"The same way people said the nfl was saved whenever the pats lost, they do the same thing to the chiefs lol"
You know Bills fans had an absolute ball tonight. Sack after sack after sack after sack. It was so satisfying.
We got Mahomes throwing a pick 6 in a Super Bowl before GTA VI
I just feel really bad for the refs. They worked so hard all season to get the Chiefs to the Super Bowl and the Chiefs completely let them down.
"eagles defense absolutely cooked, and offense especially jalen was able to capitalize. what a game for them"
This was a great game played by the Eagles
"How fitting it is for Kellen Moore to win the Super Bowl in New Orleans with the eagles, and then stay put there and begin his journey as the Saints new head coach. He has really paid his dues for this moment"
E A G L E S EAGLES LETS GOOOO!!!
E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES
"Thank you to Eagles for winning this years Super Bowl, a happy ending well deserved."
Thanks to all the NFL team and crew for posting this as fast as you can.
"Chiefs fans, I understand that losing can be difficult and because of that I just wanted to sayHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
The black magic finally ran out lol. Congrats to Eagles SB champs!!
The Eagles are Super Bowl Champions! Jalen Hurts deserves this win! You've got to give him a lot of credit on everything! He's the real MVP!
Someone check on Nick Wright Thank you Eagles from a Broncos fan
This is one of the greatest team performances in history. The Eagles tore apart the Chiefs on both sides of the ball. Thank you Eagles for saving America.
CHIEFS 3 PEAT WHERE???
eagles on top
The Eagles DOMINATED... congrats
BTA
Finally didnt give lord mahomo the W
Eagles
Theres A LOT of people that owe Hurts and this Eagles team an apology fake narratives and controversy. Constant critiquing for WINNING games. And yet another game they made the team theyre playing look average. FLY EAGLES FLY
CHIEFS FANS ARE F@GS BUTTON
I dont ever want to hear Jalen Hurts disrespect ever again! No one believed in us! I thought he was a Running Back playing QB!
Did anyone thought Patrick mahomes would pull a tom Brady comeback in this?!
EAGLES
I HATE THIS GAME AND IM AH PANTHERS FAN
Guess the refs really did help the chiefs
At least the Chiefs made it ro rhe Superbowl for rhe 3rd consecutive year and at least have the afc championship lol
Mahomo choked so bad smh
"As a Chiefs fan, we played our heart out but congrats to Jalen and his Eagles Fly Eagles fly"
Check the chiefs bank accounts
Cry chiefs bandwagons theres Eagles
Thank god
I feel so happy for Saquon! After so many years he finally got the ring he always wanted! Congrats to the Eagles for winning Super Bowl 59
"Titans fan: AJ Brown now has more super bowls than Treylon Burks has receiving touchdowns. dont worry, the Titans will gift the Eagles the #1 overall pick at this point."
Refs turned on the Chiefs!
Has a broncos fan thank you for beating the chiefs.
"Dunno about you guys, but I could watch this 17 times per season."
"Thanks to the eagles, the NFL lives on!"
"This is such an embarrassing performance by the Chiefs and Mahomes. This is the kind of performance that hurts historically. Please dont compare Mahomes to Brady or Reid to Belichick. While were at it dont compare the Chiefs to the Patriots. Tom, Bill and the Pats dominated for 20 years. Lets see how the Chiefs bounce back."
It's was already over for KC by halftime because the only Guy that can bring them back was on commentary.
Greatest/Best team in Eagles History?
Never in doubt.
EAGLESSSS
Thank you eagles-bucs fan
Smoking on that chiefs pack
Dont ever compare Mafraud to Brady ever again
FLY EAGLES FLY BABY......... the chiefs without the refs was crazy to watch
i just realized Kenny picket has a ring before josh allen
"Saquon Barkley getting traded from the Giants to the Eagles and then going back to Philly with a SB ring is something a script couldn't even write, absolutely amazing"
Giants dumb asf stupid franchise lol.
THE EAGLES ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPS
Thank you Eagles for freeing us of the Devil Magic and Taylor Swift
Kansas Shitty Queefs
The most insane rug pull the NFL has ever done to Taylor swift.
BYE CHEIFS NO THREE PEAT
Spoiler block
Ha Cheifs

"man, today was a good day for football fans"

Hey
E A G L E S EAGLESSSSSS!!!!!!
Taylor swift gonna start dating Kendrick
"Im blessed to see the Eagles squash the possible 3 peat team (like a bug on the floor). The efforts, execution, and the happiness with tears in the end goes to show why they deserved this victory."
Cooper Pick Six Birthday GIFT!!!
jalen hurts No.1 Guy in Eagles History
NO THREE PEAT FOR YALL FOLKS
Kc needs to invest in an OL
"Dont let this distract you that its been 10 years, since the seahawks decided not run the ball"
Looks like Taylor Swift will have to wait another year for that ring.
eagles just eagles..
Looks like Mahomes's check for the refs didn't clear tonight...
Seeing the chiefs lose brings a smile to America's face
Big loss
Eagles saves America
w eagles chat
"fly eagles fly, kobes proud of this team."
mahomes goat my @$$
Eagles fans
That Eagles defense is a different beast all of those defensive linemen are beasts and Mahomes just didn't have time
"Chiefs out there looking like the Raiders, they gotta be embarrassed."
"Nothing against the Chiefs, they are a historically great team. But this is the second curb stomp loss theyve taken in the Super Bowl. Never happened to Belichick or Brady. This should end the Patriots or Chiefs conversation."
Where the Jalen Hurts haters at now?
One word: DOMINATION
"Eagles after this game: they not like us, they not like us, they not like us"
Bills woulda made this competitive
KC just completely wet the bed tonight
thank you eagles
Thank you Eagles for saving football.
In Saquon Barkley we trust
The Eagles got their revenge
Best team in Eagles history! Fly Eagles Fly!
oline sold
America can accept this blowout
Mahomes cant surpassed Brady now smh
Philly is not going to be a city by tomorrow morning I promise
i think its safe to say the 10 point lead curse has been broken tonight
JALEN HURTS MVP
My prayers have been answered
Thank you Philly
Part 2 fly eagles fly
"Happy for the Eagles, feel bad for the Chiefs, But Xavier worthy did great at least he will be a problem next year"
Eagles U Did It For America.
Thank you eagles for stoping the three peat
Man I dont care what you Worthy has a hell of a future in front of him. GGs to the eagles fans yall had a great team and happy for you. Sad as a chiefs fan but you cant win everything.
"Thanks Philly Sincerely, every NFL fan (besides the chiefs)"
Anyone can say whatever they want. But this is the best Eagles team ever
The Eagles really said F the script lmao
The curse of 15 wins strikes again!
Dream crushers!!! Go birds
Chiefs finally lost Im happy now
WHAT A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE BY THE EAGLES!!!!!!!!!!
Daily reminder before Mahoverrated started to stat pad... the Eagles were winning 40-6. Mahoverrated had 1 TD 2 picks a QB rating of 60. AWFUL. His first half he was 0 TD 2 Picks QB RATING OF 10.6 LMAO. Started to statpad near the end when the game was well over. Dude's a loser and so are his stans lmao
Im glad Philadelphia ended their Kansas City 3peat because Im sick of seeing Kansas City win Super Bowls
refs couldnt save them this time!!! FLY EAGLES FLY
Absolute BTA
Crazy game
Go bills! Happy these turds got blown out
"Please put your wings together one more time for beating an undefeated team!! As a Niners fan, I was rooting for the Eagles to win this and they did!! BYE BYE CHIEFS!!"
CHEIFS WHAT HAPPENED
Some next level stat padding from Patrick Mahomes down 34 points
Thank you Eagles for MAKING AMERICA HAPPY AGAIN!!!
Defense balled out
Mahomes underperformed
This was a great SuperBowl Most times Mahomes sacked in career 2 interceptions We knew Phillys defense wasnt going to be messing around Great vengeance tour Eagles!
Congrats to the Eagles !!! That D-Line was outstanding all game
"Whats worse for Giants fans: Seeing Saquon win a SB, or win in a game the Eagles really didnt need him?"
Eagles have saved football and humanity
Don't mention Mahomes in the GOAT convo ever again!
Nah cause WAAAAHAPPPENNEDDD
"Eagles were the better team tonight, well deserved win"
Ghetto halftime show
NFC East is still the only division where everyone has a Lombardi
Josh Sweat deserved SB MVP
"REMINDER: CHEERING FOR SAQUON DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN EAGLES FANS, GIANTS FANS"
WHAT A GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
AMERICA HAS WON TODAY!! THANK YOU EAGLES FROM A TEXANS FAN.
Thank you so much Philly
This game is living proof that the 15-win curse is real no matter who it is
WZ WINN GO BIRDS!
tirst
First
FLY EAGLES FLY
If eagles deserved it
This is what happens when the refs are put on notice! The integrity of the game was at stake! They even had the first ever holding call against the Chiefs OLine in the Super Bowl!
F THE CHIEFS

"And notice, I said ""we, "" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin' - Kendrick Lamar, Euphoria"
WOW!! Can one believe this!? Show me some love for the Eagles!!!

GO BIRDS!
Cooked.
"Philly, on behalf of every NFL fan base and team, thank-you."
"This one was over from the opening kickoff. America wins, because the officials have absolutely turned their backs on the swifties this time"
Crazy what happens when the refs arent allowed to help you on the biggest game of the year
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"

But did you noticed the perfect transition made by Rockstar here ? - In the music they saying : ""Mwen pa jin frapw ni jouww"" (I never beat you or insult you) - Next scene : Jason Duval is beating someone By the way Duval is a commun creole name here in french America (at least in Martinique), so I guess Jason Duval is a Creole or Cajun Here is the music : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpAT9092Vw"

"The analogy in that first dialogue between Jason and Brian goes even deeper than just the leaks, being Jason the face of Rockstar while they work on fixing the damage made by the leaks and Brain all the players who keep forcing rockstar to deliver something while they work on fixing the damage made by the leakers. Then Jason says ""Love you"" would be a good way to treat our work here."

"Rockstar really knows how to craft atmospherethis trailer doesnt just show a game, it sells a whole chaotic, sun-soaked world. The characters feel alive, the pacing is sharp, and the details are unreal. If the final game captures even half this energy, its going to be unforgettable."
Comment section YouTuber comment section
This drops a week before my 40th birthday. I still remember playing the very first GTA
0:23 this is definitely a cut scene that transitions into gameplay.
#shortiyapa
Are you serious bro
I hope this game verry much mission and side mission
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
So much real
Does anyone else feel like there is something very wrong about making a game like this? We deal with all these issues in our fallen world on a daily basis. This trailer to me seems like it's glorifying all of what is wrong in this world... Really bad vibes here. I had bad vibes with the first trailer... This one definitely takes the cake.
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
Can't wait
What if they trolling us and the game is out May 26th 2025
Thanks for support
waitedso many years for this?
This game gonna be so epic

Such a shame some people would rather tunnel vision nitpick than just be happy or excited for this amazing looking game.
@ 2026 ????
"I feel like the story mode will be based on these twos feelings for each other. Seems like there gonna be many moments of connection between the two, and were gonna end up sympathizing for them . If this is so, they will run a goated level of revenues coming from female consumers as well I think one of the main strategy for this new chapter was going to capture the largest market they could."
"Loved this video, keep up the great work!"
Why does Jason have the voice of a sixty year old?
How cool would it be if they have a video game station inside this game where you can play GTA one?
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
2:10 everyone this is a new play station
90 million views in 1 day is crazyyy

Thank You Rockstar for this first song in the trailer 2 ! 0:27 => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u4RnEPJXmY&t=141s
Bruh
I wonder how GTA VII would be
"From what I've learned from Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto VI should last for another 10 years or more like GTA V! lol That means that GTA VII might come after ten years if this trend keeps up. We can expect multiple releases of GTA VI game for the next several years during this decade and the next."
Survive to 2026
insane graphic
Take my money and take a year of my life
The Jiggle physics are really next level ! And that Hayyy Jason scne just next level !

Prediction: Well be able to swim in GTA VIs Vice City with Jason and Lucia unlike in GTA VC with Tommy.
GTA 5...... RIP .
"The characters seem very weak. I predict RockStar is aware that they messed up the story, with dumb politics, and are now trying to salvage whats left, or at least presenting it in a different way"

Pushback so you can keep milking GTA V?? Its been dam near 12 years.
Lets forget about the bed part who was so excited for this
...
This trailer gives me goosebumps
"This video was amazing, learned a lot."
Many people will be on leave from their work when this game will be published And imagine if CJ made a grandentry in the game
this might be the last game of our lifetime
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
When when when i wonder when it hit stores around the world
So it was Jason That Stole Michaels Boat...
382 Days Yet To Go! For GTA VI

Too woke. Too realistic. Too trash

Comment
"""I never castle""?? seriously? is this an actual paradigm or is this guy full of shit?! xd"
1600
Seems like they fell in love. I`ve never seen two people smile this much and enjoy eachothers company this much at a chess game. This might be the beginning of a beautiful love story.
Yea if the guy kept quiet and not trying to distract her she would have kicked his butt earlier
"I love that you explain all the game, other I saw at the moment show the board, but not as much clear explanations as you"
"""I knew this would be the toughest round so far, so I had to deploy the boobies"""
He's smiling because shes cute
This guy feels so manipulative lol.
He seemed cordial in his defeat
0:40 u shouldve just switched seats
Tom is pretty good looking Awesome game between to attractive people with amazing brains!
i would love to see you in the semis' -- you are a food for thought kind of chess player ( not a chess geek without humanity) imho
Why do a lot of players she beats act like plonkers?
2100 I think is his rating.
Excellent.
"Tom is exhibiting casual misogyny the way so many boys do when threatened by a superior woman. He tries to take credit in two ways: One way is that he tells you what moves he's going to do so that if and when you win, he can claim credit. The other way is him giving you ""advice""/telling you what to do so that if you do win, again he credits himself for it. Glad you didn't let that BS distract you and hopefully he learned his lesson after that spanking."
"1800 ELO at a guess for arrogant Tom? Maybe 1700/1750? Well done Anna - love watching your videos and I love it more when people don't know who you are, how good you are, how nice you are and your incredible family legacy in the world of chess! Your mum is just one of the best ever! So good! Made her mark for sure!"
Bye TOM !
Is this what chess riz looks like?
He was intimidated by your beauty
"So sick of little white manchildren with giant, snowflake egos"
That was brilliant Anna
wow he was totally trying to manipulate the game by giving you suggestions. Glad you thrashed him
toms rating is for me like 1900-2100 elo
well that one was an awkward laugh when u feel like losing but u still forcing yourself to laugh so u dont get embarassed too much
That was sweet !! Cool game
wow seconds left is wicked
The music in the background is so soothing
Not sure how this got on my algorithm but Im glad. I love watching this girl kick ass with a smile.
There was something more than just chess game.
you are amazing
Loving seeing these two young adults using their brains and having fun! Bravo Anna!!!!
most enjoyable
", , , """", , ?"
Im trying to learn chess better by watching those kind of videos
"I dont castle either bc its easy to be checkmated bc of it, can someone explain why its a bad idea?"
"What I see is a peaceful game. I dont understand why people are humiliating the male gender. Yes, many boys are overly competitive, often influenced by gambling or intense sports fandoms. But I dont humiliate my opponent, and he doesnt do that either. He just lost is that really a reason to blame him? Saying Oh my God, he lost and hes a boy, so I can blame him anyway is not fair. If you believe in gender equality, then act like it."
They firm
"Iv no idea what his rating is but ""I never castle"" Why? anyone else have this rule?"
Never underestimate your opponent
Go anna i am rooting for you! You r a strong player Never let your confidence down just rise it up
This was such a great game!
What a nice interaction to watch!
You guys were meant to be. Please get married and have some baby pawns.
I would of said he was somewhere around 1300 player
"His rating? My guess: ""tool""."
You should come to africa and show the power of your chess.
Anna is Adorable Princess Beautiful Extraordinary Magnificent
Yes! What happens next!
Yes
Excellent job !
Try Concetrating with this young lady over the board !!!!!! Nope !!!
you have great t*ts that's all I can see about you
Tom? Maybe 2150
2100
You should teach him all about positions
He wanted in-pants. That is it.
Great to see such happy chess players. What was the vibe here? Were they a bit attracted to each other?
Having the girls out was a completely unfair tactic
Flirting 101!
"I was going to say 1300, but I am sure he is higher than that. Also, can't we clone her so we can all have an Anna?"
Immediately clocked 4 purple shirts in frame when you mentioned it
Tom had no chance at all - but was sooo happy during his funeral
It appears he was playing a game of giveaway. I used to do that with my kids.
"Awesome! I Used to play when I was a kid, now I feel that I want to pick this up again instead of hanging on soc media that leads nowhere for the brain."
You dont need to say everything you do. I took a sip of beer. We understand that without your inane stating what we are seeing
Tom shouldnt drink alcohol when playing. He went down like a lead balloon at the finish clearly affected by the pint of beer he slurped down the over the game. He could have won.
You can tell she thought he was a bit of a bell end
I dont know why we were smiling and laughing so much - BEER
I do.
"I love chess! Thanks for making it so entertaining and bringing it to the masses in an accessible way. Thanks, Anna! Enjoy yourself"
why do you put up with chauvinistic misogynous male ? just ignore them !
"Anna, can you pls tell why there so sad music in the backround?"
So are you still glad you didnt castle? best shit talk from Anna. His testosterone took a big dip in that moment.
Tom I never castle is probably 1800 ELO
It was a little simple I don't think he looked to retain the advantage and was a little timid
What a beautiful methodical ass whoopin!
Girl your clock running down was stressing me outttt
I think Tom is 1800+ at least!
This guy ego to the moon
I Hate Arrogance - I love it when it bites back !!
Tom is an ELO of 1200 or less
Grimacing drinking every sip of his flat 10 pint of lager to look like an 'ard man when he's actually a toff dweeb.
An English twat. No way.
Lets marry them
I wish you visit India
I think Tom came into the game a bit over confident. But great game :)
Tom 1650
6:45 8:30 10:10
1800
I rate Tom a 2/5. He's cute but annoying.
Speed chess!
"Like the way Anna says things are scary, laughs, then politely destroying the people she's scared of."
"You talk about both smiling and not sure why you're smiling? You're an attractive young lady and he's a good looking young man. Nothing unpleasant or inappropriate about it imo, simply a mild flirtation. No big deal. :)"
2300
Semmis they pulled out a bong..
"I think Tom was rated around 1600, with 300 of that because of the purple shirt."
I need him
I think he's an 1800?
"Hes just english lol, we talk like that. 80% of everything he said was clearly a joke, especially the ""I never castle"""
"Your melodramatic, click-bait cover text is what makes content creators like you lame af. Unoriginal drama queens who simply know how to manipulate @YouTube's algorithm."
"14:36 Ouch, hope he learned this lesson from you."
4:19 I love Tom's reaction to your move.
"What Ana drink, beer?"
"all things considered, he took it like a champ"
Yay! Nice job
He stole your time early in the game.
"He wanted to act as if he was helping so if he lost he could say you won cuz I helped you lol ,"
Spilling beer is very tactical good game
He probably had too much to drink hehe
"This is how it should be- fun, laughs, drinks, and learning from each other."
Great game. Thank you. Way too much happiness but a great battle nonetheless.
I was looking at that purple shirt a couple times throughout the video. I need one like that lol
She's gorgeous and plays a great game!
"Alright, would someone PLEASE specifically tell us the name of the background music playing? The entire comment section has references about it being from The Elder Scrolls IV. - Oblivion game, but I couldn't manage to find it among the OST. Please someone let us know! It's a wonderful piece and I really want to listen to it without Anna talking over it! (By the way, I really enjoyed the match between Anna and Tom, It was a nice game! I just kept finding myself bursting into tears from this wonderful piece of music and made it hard for me to concentrate on what was actually going on. Music has power, you know... As many of the others pointed out in the comments, it's key to a good video.)"
"So glad you showed him a lesson. ""I never castle"" tells me a lot of how over confident he is as the top dog of his club. I played this other guy in a chess tournament who would move and go see another game -because I was not worth his attention, I guess-, unfortunately, I did not beat him, so thank you again, your victory felt great."
Very fun game. I enjoyed your commentary.
"Anna, you're such a dood! You could whip every guy's ars including MC's by leaning forward just a little more."
should have done the cow
"At the end, his pint was empty, yours was full"
He's a major jerk.
anna crambling chadye hasta kityakk beste fodye kashe
She plays guys in that all they think about is having sex with her. Of course they are not playing chess.
"This woman is just sensational. A real femme fatale!! She is just so beautiful. I watched this with tears in my eyes because they were both having such fun. Tom is a classic Brit...non aggressive, loves a pint, happy to share what he knows....you thought he was playing head games but he wasn't, this is classic British fair play and enjoying the interaction of a sport or pastime. So wonderful to see people smiling and enjoying a game. Well played Tom and well played Anna...the smiles and enjoyment are testament to the British lack of ego/bluff/BS and Anna's love of the interaction of good people."
3:50 your commentary is very funny
"An excellent win, Anna ! And if I were him, I would never underestimate my opponent, especially if Id never played them before."
Im guessing hea around 1900
This is a strategy to give advice. It distracts from your plans and gets you off your game.
Misogyny
"if he would've took his pawn in A2 he'd win this game, at least i guess so"
Tom's Rating - just guessing = 1200 to 1500.
I think youre a little too cocky you may think youre good but your strategy is weak!Strong mouth though
He was bedeviled by her grace and beauty.
Is he around 1800?
So much hate for Tom. I think you two should go on a date.
"Basically, new Anna's boyfriend"
"great stuff, love the enthusiasm for this"
Nice!
"Wow, the clickbait. I hope he sees this and calls you out, never playing chess with you"
"I've never laughed, as much as he laghed in the video, in my whole life"
that purple shirt looks good on Tom. Great win btw. I'm learning. Sloooowly learning
the misandry in this comment section.....
Her vibe checks out. I'm with it.
"You are truly pathetic, all you do in these videos are showing your egomaniacal self, especially towards men in some feminazi agenda. a true narcissist. ust look at your obnoxious titles of your uploads, and sorry you're no bobby fisher nor magnus carlsen..."
YES ANNA
"Emma, youve turned my confusion into clarity! Im so thankful for your support"
Keeping your beer in front of the clock is driving me nuts
tom is 1800 best
"Yes, lets see more of the tournament."
"at the 12 minute mark you seem to be implying by the blue arrows that he can somehow move the pawn to g4 and that would somehow push the queen to g5 automatically, but that's not a legal move as far as i know. Am I wrong, and if so what is that moved called and where is it in the rules? I admit I could be wrong, and just want to know how that would work. Or perhaps the video is not implying that."
Great for you! At least he wasn't a poor loser.
Yes
2000 rating I think
It was a good chass game ending in chak mate.
Great job your awesome!
Congratulation for staying concentrated till the end against this toxic fish!
She fell in love with this guy
These girls are doing for chess what Caitlin Clark did for women's basketball. They are making it fun instead of weird like most of the guys seem to be.
He drank his entire pint..
"Thanks Anna, great job."
"Too much talk baby,too much talk"
i like you girl!
"""It's about having fun"" That's what she said"
You have a beautiful mind....
Anyone knows the name of the music played in this video ? Thanks
I love ur energy girl u always put a smile on my face
His laughter was histeria at the thought that you dominated him.
Where is your next opponent after Tom?
He was 2250?
I think at 8:16 you should have been like sack the ROOOKKKK like levi haahahahaha
Idk why he didnt go E7 with the queen taking the knight but instead moved his rook to threaten your queen. He could have threatened a lot more material with this move. He had time.
Must be fun to go to that tavern.
"You're lucky 2 have the money to London, England because I'm stuck in 1 country"
"1:46 I'm not trying to be a perv but, She'd win quicker if she took her jacket off. It's not against the rules to distract your opponent."
Anna definitely earned this game and this guy definitely did not want to get check mated BUT Some how I think he enjoyed this loss more than any other He was impressed with her ability and skills which made him fall even further in love
I love her smile its so genuine
So. Tom loses 20% of the time.
Tell me you dont like her smile ( you lie.. :P ) awesome player and beautiful!
I think Tom rating is 2000
Anywhere from 1500 to 1700. Never castles?! Very odd strategy
"His laughing is quite manipulative, it's an attempt to mask weakness, feigning mirth to pretend he's unconcerned with her plays. Making light instead of taking her seriously cost him a game"
tom is so hot id be lost in his eyes and smiles. i bet thats why his win rate is 80%
950
luv watching her play
I would wager that this guy isn't all he is cracked up to be. He intimidates his opponents with his banter and that's why he 'wins' so many games.
loved the game ur oves board helped me watch where she went i learned 2 play at 6 yrs old my grandfather taught me i have 2 chess boards congrats anna
"I know nothing about chess, yet I watched this whole video."
He plays chess like he makes Luv... aggressive Never a good Strat.
why did he take the knight in the end????
Why didn't she take c6 with bishop then rook then king is in check until dead?
How could anyone not have a crush on Tom?
Tom telling his kids a story*and this Kids is How i met your Mother*
Yes!
5:49 whole independent story going on in the background
"I have no idea what his rating could be, but I have followed so far. ;-)"
I dont know his rating but it is obvious that you liked him. :)))) Great game though! Thanks for sharing it!
"Hands down, he's clearly a good player, and the banter is all part of it."
"I don't know anything about chess, but I was watching and hoping the girl would win."
I guess something like 1800
It is obviously he helps you.he just lost at least 2 opportunities.
"Fajne Z Rana, robisz mi fajny dzien. Twoj sympatyczny glos, sposob jakim mowisz, usmisch i pozytywny Ausstrahlung wplywaja na to. Takich ludzi trzeba wiecej"
1400?? rating
Congratulations. That's awesome.
Beautiful. Any chance of a game?
She's good
he should have checked your king at 13:09 and eliminated those pawns.
You're so cute!! Lol
"""meowve"""
Nice she's drinking a proper ale/bitter pint
i hate when people try to burn the clock to win. good game!
Id play with you
You play very similar to me . I think I could beat Tom. My dad is a chess player and I bed. Played chess for number of years and just started again few months ago
mansplaining at its best.
Cool game !
I don't think he's a bad guy but you sure humbled him greatly
"Tried to learn chess once, but I couldnt get past figuring out which pieces could move in which directions. It was like trying to learn another language that has a different alphabet than English - (and I love leaning foreign languages). But the strategy and logic of chess really appeals to me, and I love watching Annas videos, even though I dont understand much. Wonder if my local chess club would take on a 70-year-old newbie?"
Kind of a rude title. Its a friendly game of chess and you wouldnt like it if someone made a video of you and slandered your name
you just braging... supose uneed it
"this chick is one of the worst players I have ever seen. OMG, she something over 20 and loks like over 30"
What a dick head.
Solid game!!!
I'm smitten
"Even in this day and age, after the book & miniseries of The Queens Gambit have been out, do men still really always expect they will beat every/any woman at Chess? Illogical."
Definitely the hottest chess player I've ever seen. The blonde's kind of cute too
I rank Tom as a 7 but I only see his profile. The semi-final guy is a very solid 8 from the side.I might have to learn to play chess
Tom is quite patronising.
let's bring the next round
Prend ton temps ...je sais que tu trouveras un nouveau compagnon comme Key
"Unbelievable theres 3,6 million people watching chess. Good job"
It appears the guy who was hyping him up also lost to that other girl. Nice
Purple shirts
*rofl* 5 Bucks?
Smashed it Anna
2500?
I'm not a good chess player but at 2:06 how did you move 2 pieces at the same time? That doesn't seem like a legit move.
Tom s obnoxious
She is hot.
so whats his rating
I would think Tom rating is 1000 to 1200
"I like his purple shirt, too."
Can you mate me in 20s something tells me he wouldnt last 5s
"""This was Tom. . . he's dead now"""
This guy is a d bag nervously laughing the entire game. So weird
damn!!!
Her boobs are really quite tactical.
"Don't know what a rating in chess is, but I enjoyed watching."
Beat you *at* chess.
"Tom's rating sucks. Really sucks. By the way, you guys don't seem to support small amounts of alcohol (beer -> all that laughing)."
Tom's weakness is that he talks too much revealing his tactical shotgun. The war was already over and alcohol is partly the cause. It was fun. But I wouldn't make him a general in the army. No way. A revealer of secrets is capable of implosion and that's what happened.
Well....at least Tom can slap KO you if he decides to....
Really good commentary
Male ego
Where is the semi final video please?
"I liked the way you never gave up on keeping the centre, staying where the strength is even with lots of shrapnel and potentials flying about, and your pawn play was logical, I am surprised he was surprised by B4, it was the right extension of strength. Perhaps he wanted a good brawl, and usually got it, and won, but you didn't let that happen. Commendation to your compliments to your player, it would have been very easy to react badly to how he spoke to his opponent."
I'd love to see the semifinal. What's Tom's rating? 1800-1900 ish?
If I could play chess...I would lose every time with that chest sitting across from me
My rate is.. HOT!! Hes a cutie!
"Its funny you mentioned his shirt at the end, because I was thinking right before that how dude in the tannish outfit had missed the ""cool colors memo"", like even a dude chilling and watching for a sec then moving on was on theme. Green khaki doesnt count, try again."
adam konumaktan dnemedi.... ukalaca glerken kolayca alabilecei oyunu kaybetti....
"ive never had any interest in learning or playing chess, nor do i know any of the rules yet i watched the whole video because it was so interesting"
"He played well at the beginning, but then he made some mistakes and obviously bad moves, that could be better. For example not taking a knight with the queen."
Very Good vdeo!
I really like the breakdown of what you're thinking!
"""a chess tournament for the prize of winning a bottle of champagne"" yeah no i will just buy me a bottle for 5 bucks and get drunk in bed"
Nice game!
"The smiling, chatting and, laughing is called flirting for some people."
Tom got like 2100
yes
980
"Damn girl, you drink real beer. As a Mexican you've earn my respect"
His purple shirt tells me all I need to know.
He didnt seem like some overconfident guy.. he seemed like a very nice sweet polite kind guy.. and a few of your comments were rude. Very egoistic. Just feedback take it as is..
His rating is.....over-confident.
"Hey Tom, dont assume you're gonna win."
And now we are married.
very good
Just an arrogant posh boy who cant handle a talented woman. Socially awkward and well out of his comfort zone
alcohol
"Is it just me, it seems to me like this guy is trying real hard to pretend he's Tom Cruise."
the music is on point lol
Your clearly alot better then they or anyone realises and your humility works well in your favour as well...very well played on everything.
Is chess often foreplay?
I mean he aint that good tho
*Za duo gadasz.*
He was so threatened haha.
Congrats Anna! Impressive how you stayed confident and focussed with hardly any time on the clock.
he let u win cuz he's a simp.
14:55 Maybe because you guys thought you were both fun!!
Guessing 1784 rating
I tasted beer once in my life and it was so disgusting I never drank any more ever again. It surprises me that Anna is drinking beer during a tournament.
"""Even though he was smiling...he was a good chess player."" lmao"
He constantly gaslights and interrupts while his opponents rounds to steal time
As an amateur I prefer to play with other amateurs no time limit involved.
"fun game, thanks for sharing, nice playing Anna"
Lets see the semifinals! Good match!
"i subscribed to be honest, because you are cute,, male weakness, and you are smart, another bonus, but, I have grown to love youre commentary, and interaction with some bad ass humans. I do NOT play chess, have no idea how, but i can see intelligence in this game, and in you...... so awesome, and entertaining!! Subscribed!!"
When you shake hands eye contact is essential as a respect toward to your partner in game.
Is this speed chess or is the video sped up?
A lot of insecure men here who think she only won because he was drunk Im sure shed be happy to play against any of you sober and whoop your arses
good game Anna
I like the way you smile and playing the chess...realy a verry smart and tactical player.
"The pawn is across the middle of the board and it never ever moves. All she has to do is move that pawn up and it changes everything much earlier that what was done. (NEVER leave a potential queen from at least attempting to transform the game). I feel as though these are silly little games that have no actual substance. That pawn was the most important piece on the board for the entire time and it shows because white was terrified of it and never engaged it on the sheer hope that it just wouldn't be considered. And white was right. It never was, because that pawn was never moved ever again!!!!!! If there wasn't a timer, she would have lost 99 times out of 100 because of her inability to move what is basically a queen. But it is never a queen unless it moves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would destroy this woman. What I have seen from watching about 20 videos is that she is a memory gamer. She watches opens and has the capacity to end the last stage quickly. But if she is upended with something that doesn't register in her memory for basic or historical openings, she is utterly lost; and this is completely validated in the idea that a potential queen *NEVER MOVED*. And yeah, against a guy getting drunk fighting a timer didn't win, how many games were filmed where she just completely fails?????????? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM....."
I think Tom at least 1700 elo. GG!
This video should have 3.5 million likes lol
thats a fine chess board
Maybe he compliments and says what he's doing because he wins 80% of games he plays so he's used to too easy and helping components. I hope he learned a lot this game tho.
I love how nervous he got and how immediately he shook her hand when she won. Gg
"The other right, right?"
"7:00 anna he is just having a friendly match. Most men aren't playing the insecurity game and just genuinely trying to be helpful. If he didn't like you he wouldn't give you any useful information against him. To guys like that the whole goal is to improve, in his head he is preparing you for anyone who uses a similar strategy, he already recognizes you are tremendously talented so he contributes the little he can."
Whats wrong with being confident and after actually watching the video this looks like a very friendly game of chess .
He became quiet real fast XDDDD
Men
1800?
"Wow, you're much nicer than me. You say he seems like a great guy, I would say he seems like a prick"
"Maybe he'll castle from now on lol. He was so annoying. ""I never castle."" Thanks for beating him!"
"As a learning chess player almost 1000, the commentary about why you moved where you did was incredibly interesting. Thanks!"
wow this made me smile. SHE ATE THAT
why did you word the video like he was evil
"I'd never win , I can't stop looking at her face."
Im still wondering what his rating is?
Her smile reminds me of Emelia Clark's smile. Adorable and happy.
So did you sleep together?
The moment I heard the name Tom then Id be like he must be a dick.. lots of Toms are dicks
"Here in the Philippines, Tom's rating will be below 1900. He is a rich boy who never bet a dollar for a game. He is not a fighter. He is unlike Emanuel Lasker. He showed his teeth smiling during the game and never showed his fang."
Fantastic !
"My grandfather had a chess computer way back in the day and it was his most prized possession. He taught me the basic rules, but I didn't catch the fire. My brain is not wired for chess but I respect it a lot."
See ya
Did u get Toms number tho? Would be a cute couple
I have no idea what you're saying or how this got recommended to me; as I do not know how to play chess nor have I tried to learn really - but I love seeing men being humbled and girl you sure delivered
"At 13:08, you couldnt have escaped to F7 because his Queen was covering it."
"He might have won, if he wasn't thinking about you ;)"
Beautiful.... At the pub we all spill our beer. You are not alone love. May you be blessed
You are beautiful chess player you are obviously beautiful he never had a chance oh my God
I think he was in over his head from the beginning! Grandmaster
Nicely staged!!
Hello
What chess match?
What am I doing here? I don't even like chess... but this is so entertaining! :D
I do t know ratings but Ive been watching the level of redness in his face go from normal to quite red. It was awesome
oberyn martell next? gl
"he let you win to get to fuc.k you, because he is beta... the question is, did he succeed?"
"He's hot, i would let him do me"
You developed the better tactical game with a strategy = win.
Her accent is so nice
Semi-nice sound. Not my taste but I do not think it sound bad. I suppose that it is a great office keyboard.
Troll people by being a stero-typicall dumb barbie blond
"Lady I think I can beat you if you spot me a rook, gota give me a least 20 min. Just kidding you, i havent played chess for about 3 decades. When I was 12, our club went to play Tigran Petrosen In his simultaneous, 50 players. I was the last player he played, put a clock down and said i have 5 mins to finish. I was the exchange up/ I had a rook and pawns he had a knight and pawns. Must have got flustered he moved very fast and i lost. was told by 2 different expert rated that i had a won game."
This just got recommended to me for some reason (I have no idea how to play chess) but I couldn't stop watching
"Anna, I don't know how to drink beer and play chess well. I'll play with friends in a bar. We enjoy ourselves, but the quality of chess suffers. You're brilliant. You have to be."
"It seems like you were trying to vilify them. Did you ever act like that towards a dude, but then he defeated you?"
He played that game like a 1600 rating.
I absolutely love these big mouth chumps. Always so smart till she whups em.
I wonder what else Tom never does if he never castles. Bet hes one of those guys who are sure they will always be able to pull out at the right moment.
"Brilliant, that was so good to watch <3"
Are u an oblivion fan or is just because most videogame music is cooyright free
errr he wasn't overconfident hun
"He's cute though, if it wasn't for his attitude this had rom-com energy."
"Love this video, what chess should be!"
Very well done he did not play to his fullest as never castles I alway like castling on the queen side it always gives me a lot more time in the game be for I lose it. I was always told the most powerful pieces on the board are the pawns and you proved this is right thank you oh and the purple shirt is authority power colour in charge. His speaking was a control tactic and would put people off Trying to win and give up. not to sure if he knows that. Love watching thank you
He was shocked that you beat him!!!
"Imagine If they had children together ? They look like an awesome couple. The super brain child would rule the world, Elon would be crushed! LOVE this channel, peace from Detroit MI."
"Remember, kids half of YouTube entertainment is fake orchestrated scenarios. On a sidenote, I wish I had boobs."
I feel toms rating is like 1800
Blows my mind how she can see 8-10 moves ahead! Impressive!!!
dumb game
Marriage incoming
Anna is so adorable
this was so much fun
"Such a good example of the dichotomy of men and women. She's focused on the game, he's focused on the girl, and she can't tell why he's smiling and laughing so much."
she loves to teach men a lesson. lol
"12:58 tower f2,"
Tom isn't a good guy ..Tom is a pretentious twatt. Tom is manipulative
Genius!
"Probably like 1800, and literally you said keep your eyes on the prize two times even though you didn't want to"
Thank you for narrating your thought process! It was great!
"Congratulations, fantastic girl. You represented me in this game."
When Men get defensive in situations like this its because deep down they view women as inferior to them. They dont see women as equals physically or intellectually (skill wise too) and always expect to be superior to them. Good on you for hopefully changing his perspective. You go girl !
Why does he never castle? That's like running a marathon in a potato sack....
we lost so much
THATs a KILLER QUEEN.
Dude's mind wasn't on his game. I was on how to get you to go out with him.
"I don't understand chess well. I barely grasp how the pieces function, but the image and explanations helped. Great game!"
Hes cute. Whats his @?
Too much beer for Tom
This was great and thank you for taking the time to narrate your thought process. Please post the next round!
"Your arrogance, smothered by your, supposed, sweetness, is just so objectionable."
"A lot of people judging people for their reactions while they are filmed on camera in a way that is 100% not spontaneous. Both people bashing on this guy and people saying he was spontaneous have no clue about his character and neither do I. Still, good game and nice vibes"
Very well played. You were able to keep your composure and be aggressive with so little time left.
650 rating for tom
"basically, don't drink a pint of beer in 5 minutes and expect to play decent chess...she would have beaten him anyway, he was way too overconfident..and she is too good for those shenanigans ..well done Anna"
She has a huge advantage over men. Being distracted by beauty makes it hard to play chess
I learned a lot from this game. Good game. Anna!
"At 12:31, if Tom went BH7 he would've won, no?"
Why are people trying to make this into a sexist thing? If yall dont see how youre part of the problem by making what is normal chess talk out to be sexism then I guess theres no saving you What a non-issue
I can sense that Tom was destroying 80% of man players only. Seems he is a little bit distracted by how beautiful you are
I have no clue what his rating is but he surely likes you and your game.
His quite good
Anna you should play Sue State
"Yes, watch them all. We love you"
Beautiful
"I dont get dxc4 at 4:14. You say you want to make the bishop move, but one move later you force it back to that exact same position. What am I missing?"
Good Comentary! Makes me want to watch more.
Anna: We were having fun and Tom was nice the internet: Well actually
"If I was young,I would consider this young lady a true prize"
Good commentary!
is the overconfidence in the room with us?
"I hate players like this. The ones that run their mouths off. Trying to make you take more time thinking about there future moves. So you'll be overthinking and rundown your clock. Culminating with you making mistakes, when you're left with seconds and they have minutes. *One should play the board NOT the player. It ain't Poker.*"
When someone is video recording the game you must realize you are about to be hustled on YouTube or TikTok
Tom's Rating is 1000!
She almost got tricked but she kept strong on her game
you was doing what great Martial artists do to control the fight and waste less energy telling her things to control the board not bad
"2:00 she really got her pieces out, bouncy like."
Had alot of fun winning
Tom is cute
I don't play chess and like you're channel but it's strikes me that for some reason there are a lot of guys acting like bellends who think that they're cool trying to be an alpha in a chess game
This is so wholesome
I feel like I was teached chess wrong.
she even came for his purple shirt
What a finish with just 16-17 seconds on the clock! Wow.
"Damn, she's good looking."
"YES! YOU GO GIRL!! It feels so good to see you win and ofcause I / we want to see more,,,,every game, can't get enough!! . And to be honest, it's not just the game, is you and your personality, your smile, make all ppl around you happy. So keep spread joy and happiness....the world need more Anna!! But I still have a hard time to accept you didn't win ""Frrdarna"""
That was a great match
"This was awesome to watch. I know that I am not smart enough or have the memory to ever play this game. The Fact that it looked like both of you were playing and not even thinking about it blows my mind. Not sure why this popped up on my list but, I enjoyed watching. Thanks for sharing!!!"
I've watched a thousand of these videos and still haven't learned how to play chess.....
Yes! You have to show how the tournament ended!
"i still done understand why anyone would destroy beers by playing whatever this game chess is. also, i dont know how to play chess; hence, the reason for my love of never mind"
"That was a great game! Thank you for sharing, and your strategies. I learned a lot!"
Epic level flirting ...................................................
"He's not a ""nice guy"" he was an ass. Trying to tell you what you do and then acting like you needed his approval on your moves. Men like that always feel superior to women and I'm glad you showed him that women can go toe to toe with men."
Shes hot.
16:32 wasn't there a checkmate by just moving a knight??
You and Tom would make a very cute couple
"I see what happened there, Toms glass was empty"
2100
"""To win a bottle of wine"" The very next shot shows a 12 yr old girl is competing."
He doesnt seem overconfident he seems nice
He's been hemmend in the whole game... she is so unassuming kmowing he is going down. Love it!
"I know nothing about chess, I dont know anything about what youre saying and no clue why this was recommended but Im just here for the girl power. Well done queen"
You make me wanna learn chess! Its so great with so clever people being this humble! I think i can actually learn a few things from your videos!
"He was hitting on u, he thought he could beat u to then ask u out as a prize. Naah swedish women are to smart."
"At first I thought ""okie this title seems like a small clickbait, cuz this guy wasn't actually so rude"", but in long term he really seemed like an insecure douchebag."
"At 14:55, does ...Bxf3 wins in a few moves?"
what is her rating?
cool
Refusing to castle was his Achilles heel. Anna castles a lot. Time clock was close on this one though.
@Luigiisahero Dude its the game of war.
Yes please
this buffoon wants more than a chess game
he mansplains sooooo much
"Bro was smitten and thought he'd easily impress her, his first blunder."
Amazing play. I have never played but I enjoyed watching you and your mom video's
Tom is rated 2000
Guy was perfectly nice. But you woke morons think every guy is a threat
play the london system in london
Men...smeh
He is off his face
"I'm a complete beginner in chess, but would moving the queen from C2 to H7 have given him checkmate at 4:48?"
You're a real queen
who wouldn't enjoy playing very smart eyecandy
"This was really cool to see! It was so even game for most of it, a very solid match. Ana did super well and the video was nicely formatted so I could follow along even tho I dont play chess lol. Tho tbh I dont feel like Tom is misogynistic as the comments are saying. Hes a frequent champion so of course hes going to be confident, hes had a 80% chance of winning overall. I feel like after a bit he knew he was evenly matched or even under matched and was using tactics to win. Because what do you do when you are up against a bigger and better opponent and you want to win? You use tactics. I think this is just people playing chess and a good game. But maybe this is just me, I dont really pick up social clues very well."
Playing a game against a pretty lady it's natural we aren't operating at 100%
You two would make a great couple
"He was trying to ""assure"" Anna that she was making the best moves... which given who she is, id wuite condescending. He genuinely may not be familiar with her?"
"Idk I ship you guysss yall were both smiling and giggling , you liked his shirt, he was impressed by your smarts I see it"
No idea Colin Jost could play chess
"A conceited guy that was thought he was an alpha, but is a beta. Well played."
"This is worth a manga OS about overconfidence and the value of respecting your opponent as, yk, your opponent."
Yes
"Tom's rating? Probably 1850 or even a bit higher. Quick thinker, but clearly not concentrated (due to beer and female opponent). Not using his time and underestimating opponent."
I use your videos for learning english your accent is so nice
"8:16 what do you think about Ra6 after dxc5? EDIT: doh, nvm. Did not realize you would basically just give away the rook 16:59 what about Ne2+? Threatening if Kf1 then Qh1+ Qg1 Qxg1#"
All the smiling and giggling you guys were doing and didnt know why is called sexual tension
"Anna, when you said you would not say ""Eyes on the Prize"" again, that was twice. LOL"
"I dont see a lot of purple shirts, everyday."
What a kid..shes ice
"Girlfriend, he liked you! Hes smiling because hes interested. Youre smart and pretty."
I have terrible insomnia and these chess videos make me mad sleepy. Finally found a medicine for my condition!
A full beer and a chess clock dont see like good table mates!
anna wanted to fck tom
How did you gain time on your clock?
That bum wasnt tough babe
"Granddaughter looks beautiful, if i beat u can u marry me?"
Tom plays like an amateur.
Legend has it... Tom goes to the Mayor after this video.
Yes please to the next round!
"7:09 his remark of ""I'm gonna stick you"" playing both sides of the board seems eager/urgent."
"A cool, confident victory; congratulations."
"Chess is the best game ever invented by man (please don't crucify me: when I say 'man' I mean it in a gender non-specific, all gender inclusive, all humans ever, boy or girl, it, they, or what WTF are you?!). It's just a great game!"
"If you didn't, I think you should date one of those two men. Didn't get to see what your chemistry was with the second one, but clearly there was chemistry with the first one."
@16:09 Tom's rating is 2150
never castle?!
"This guy is a big time asswipe. Wait in 10 yrs and see where he is at, toothless and on crack.. the fukn teeth are begging to come out anyways.. you meet jackoffs like that all the time, and then they dissappear, because nobody likes assfucks like him!!!"
"tbh, you were kind of a b*tch in this, which doesn't suit you. ""Are you enjoying your position?"" ""Was it worth it to not castle?"" These are kind of dick comments when you're winning..."
Liittle bit chauvinist boy
girl i dont play chess anymore since like 4 years ago and i hve no idea how this vid got on my recomms but WAS I INVESTED? HELL YEAH. YOU CRUSHED HIM
Stupid made video
He could smell your vadge....and he was angling for it.....
"It's a strange thing about self-perception. Many years ago, my girlfriend at the time introduced me to a friend who seemed to be good at chess. He really wanted to play and I won. Then he really wanted a rematch and I won again. I was a bit embarrassed about the whole thing because he was very confident and I had played rather poorly."
Alot of using your girl skills to get him off his game before it even started
Me watching this like I know what she's saying LOL
"By how Tom played and his way of moving, guessing his rating would be around 1750...?"
"If it was over confidence he would have been angry at the end when reality hit, I think he was disarmed because Anna is so pretty--and friendly as well. There are four basic preferences for handling conflict, that would be a better way to analyze the psychological aspects of the game."
"What does it mean to be flagged, is that running out of time?"
"I have not played chess in such a long time, I am not sure how this found my suggestions to watch but I am glad I found this channel. well played and fun to watch"
Tom wants to f U!
I think Toms raiting is like 2100
"This is my very first time viewing one of Anna's videos, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. She and Tom have great chemistry! She should definitely include him in her future videos......maybe next time as her date . As for his rating, having won 80% of his matches (That is, of course, prior to receiving Anna's beatdown ...just joking. As we all witnessed, he played a good match.), I'd guess he's at a cool 2000 ."
"Looks like he just had had one beer more than you, that can make all the difference"
Was Tom's rating ever confirmed?
Can someone explain why Tom couldnt go Queen G7 at 10:40 ?
When a man feel threat by a woman he will inevitably start to mansplain everything. It's not a good strategy to tell your oponent your intention Tom.
you won by your distraction...
28
I THINK HIS RATING IS 23O
Yes.
"Oh my god, you( 2 grandmaster parents) beat a random guy on the street? What a shock"
I wish I can find anyone to play I play people on the phone but playing with the broad and the piece's a whole different ballgame face to face how she set up he post to castle and got his king up outta harms way when he didn't castle his king was wide open for the kill
You ate him
"When he was at 505 why wasnt take pawn with queen, check. Free night or threatening pawn the play?"
"Im a chess novice and never participate in chess competition before (just play for fun). But your video come as suggestion. I clicked and instantly hooked the entire video. Love how you explain the moves and it easily captured even to a novice such as myself. You make me wanted to try to enroll in a competition! but I know Im going to be butchered tho. Nevertheless, you have instill some courage to me!"
"As a new chess player myself, I love how she explains her thought process. Really cool to watch! Thanks!!"
"He was sniling,I was smiling,I dont know y we were smiling so much."" We all know,but its cute,so I wont say anything. Im smiling too"
"Sounds like she described herself ""Super smiley,happy, friendly,vut super strong player"""
"This girl seem so arrogant, in what way was he ""overconfident""?"
"I have no idea the minimum amount of moves it takes to win, but I bet she could lower that number if I was playing. I understand the movements if each piece but thats about it."
Definitely staged
now going out with wirtual is crazy
Yesssss stick it to the mannn
"Its obvious to me he has a crush on you. Easy to understand as many of us do. I think, not to undermine your ability that he was distracted by his emotions and was more interested in you than wining. Very nice guy I hope you guys go on a date cause he seems really cool and nice."
Tom is a good looking chess player
"He's a dick, well done."
Great game
1800
Too much chatter! Edit please
Humans do it
"Like, 1950 for him"
You're to nice in your commentary ... that guy was such a douche Oo
"Sounded to me like he was ""mansplaining"" in the beginning, which did him no service."
Maybe he's 1500
Rating 1700
Toms rating: 800
Tom rating is 69
You couldve done a brilliant move at 14:55 with forced mate by sacrificing the bishop instead of taking the rook
2100
Ok but beat bedman beat bedman you cant
Pleure pleure pleure pleure Anna vas-y fait timide ACoucheAnna AcoucheAnna
Its because hes a douche
Good game Anna!
"Shakespeare wrote....."" one may smile and smile and be a villain ""."
12:04
"well, I have no idea what is going on here it might as well be in another language but found it interesting and watched till the end and none the wiser"
What a great video! Wonderfully explained and that pub looks like a nice time. Anna is brilliant.
"I don't know your rating so inferring his is also tricky but given the pace of play and the 80% win rate at a casual pub/bar setting social event for the prize of a bottle of wine. I will guess he's somewhere been 1700-1900? Am I way off I don't know. I click this video anticipating that I would dislike the dude on the grounds of him being arrogant and aggressively and overtly insecure & sexist ( as opposed to maybe slightly subconsciously sexist as in the early mansplaining & suggestions) .. but to his credit he seems like a super good guy, I can also tell the in relation to you (although I'm sure winning was probably his biggest motivation, I can unmistakably tell that he is also definitely invested in wanting you to like him. Who can blame him. But There's certainly a universe in which might make a cute couple"
She hung her knite
Her channel really brings the one show from awhile ago to life. I really hope i find something to be as passionate about as she does chess
He's deficient otherwise he wouldn't be so condescending
are we not gonna talk about the child playing for a bottle of wine
nice !! :)
I think he let you win
I think Tom has never played such a beautiful woman. You blew his mind.
"You are absolutely amazing, Anna. I am totally fascinated. WOW."
Love how you humbled this cocky Brit.
I loved seeing lots of women participating!
:48 yea because he is sitting infront of a beautiful girl haha
I just skip to the end to watch the overconfident participant capitulate with a humiliating handshake. Get some.
The man was a good sport after all
I NEED that guy with the light blue chess shirt.
"Great entertaining game, enjoyed that."
WEARING THAT WAS YOUR SMARTEST MOVE IN THIS VIDEO LOL IN THE COLD YOUR A KILLA
Tom 1200 ELO
Drop it
He had your knight easy from 13:40 onward. Why not take it and press your bishop with that move?
You two have chemistry
booba
9:;20 - MOVE QWUEEN OUT
That boy wants to date you.
"Wait You guys are playing chess, and drinking beer at the same time? Where the hell do I sign up? Ill be on a plane tomorrow. Where are you guys? Thats insanely fun."
Way to blow your own trumpet
They both held back.... they need a real match
"She didn't wanna loooooooose try again with both of you sober, it'll be a different game. Promise. I try to play when I drink and I mistake and blunder more often even if I still make great moves. My best games are when I can take the time to think"
"I am also love the purple shirt xD I was learning the chess before, now i am learning something like flying on random mind set and yet focusing the chess play."
this feels like real life Queens Gambit
Love seeing misogynist men being humbled.
I think Tom was a 1750-1800
Yes ...more plzzz
Great game! Thank you for your channel.
Toms an ass
I guess this is what flirting in chess looks like.
"Hi Anna, I love your videos and find them therapeutic and mesmerising! Just one request from a newbie to Chess - on your graphics, you beautifully highlight possible subsequent moves with the blue and red arrows, but when check or checkmate is a potential do you think you could highlight immediately where the King is with, perhaps, a red circle for for check and a flashing red circle for checkmate? I always struggle to find the pieces on a mid-game board"
7:31 - lmao Anna cant comprehend when a guy likes her why is he being so nice? Is this some chess tactic?
Please get on with it..
I applauded and did a backflip you go girl
"I am not a good chess player but I watch your videos because of how friendly, kind, and cheerful you are. You are full of light."
"I think he was a little full of himself, over confident and I think he likes to play head games and try and lead his opponents on in a direction HE wants. Your BEST move was to IGNORE HIM. You didn't do what he wanted and that left him clueless. Brilliant game! Well done!"
"I HATE chess, but your voice over had me so invested omg"
"Confidence without knowledge is arrogance, but there lies wisdom in acknowledging ones lack of knowledge. Therefore confidence with knowledge equals ignorance."
How i met your mother
Isn't the term beat me at.. not in Chess Grammar matters
he honestly got enticed by your feminine energy but left his smarts aside
Tom's rating is about 1800. My rating is 2300 and I would take the shit out of her.
Anna and Tom might get married. I saw the sparks already flying.
I cant stop thinking about Komugi and Meruem during all this
"great game, also love how your outfit colors kinda match & ur both so smiley :)"
Watching you sip from an open cup in a public space surrounded by so many people made me nervous for you . Anyone could spike your drink . Please stay safe.
"When he said that he never castles, I knew that he was going to lose the game"
"Champions quietly win graciously and encourage their opponents. Losers make empty threats. They should be encouraged to keep talking (to themselves basically). ""Do you always talk to yourself or just when losing at chess?"""
The one extra skill she has that I doubt her parents do is that she's an excellent broadcaster. This commentary's fantastic.
his rating might be 3302
"Was he non-stratetic, petty, just small attacks?"
Rating 4 what?
What is it gonna be? Always right. Points to his left
"""WAS!"" Tom... aaaah where did they bury him?"
17:40 hope u did him he's niice
1850
Love your videos and your playing style. I spent some time playing with Pia and Stellan in Limhamns chessclub as a young boy. Good to know that you're carrying the torch.
I have no clue whats going on but its entertaining!
Tom Riddle.
"Answering the question about rating, I think he would be around 1500 if he plays online."
She could have won with so much more grace on the twelfth minute.
I can beat u.
"I like how we're using anime terms nowadays. ""He was the strongest at chess"""
"I used to play chess with my grandpa when I was 4, and only with him. Until now, I thought this was so boring and yet, I am sitting here, watching till the end during my lunch break...Thanks Anna, my grandpa would love this!"
"He was all flirty, who would judge him?"
bro i can not be the only one that ships them omg
2200
This popped up on my feed and its interesting but I have zero idea whats going on. I hear a lot of numbers and feel like Im in math class
Toms biggest mistake was just after you made NB3 and he made QG4. His mistake was going for check mate when he had a clear advantage of time. He should have made the move BE4 and threatened your Queen. At this point his strategy should have been to trade queens or other pieces to run down your clock. And if nothing else trade queens as that was your key piece that allowed you to win.
"""Are you enjoying your position?"" - yeah sure he does lol right infront of you."
"There was clearly some attraction here on both your parts, and I think thats what made this game so lovely to watch. Well done for beating him!! I hope you guys stay in touch"
14:59 his rating -2530
i know absolutely nothing about chess and yet you made the whole thing insanely riveting to watch. Awesome stuff.
"Well there were suffering, on his behalf"
i think he probably using his brain thinking about others things than chess
Where is this place in London?
U put beer on the floor show tit's
pointless game :)
Anna I love watching you play. Not just your skill but the fun you have. Thanks for letting us share in your adventures.
Imagine being in a relationship with this guy with that attitude.
She uses the best camera angles and clothes for optimal views
2300
Alkohol niszczy mielin jeszcze przez 6 tygodni po wypiciu. Po co ludzie sobie to robi...
"I don't know his rating, but I think a little bit of mutual flirting was going on too. At 16:50 he said, ""Can you mate me in 20 seconds."" I think he immediately realized that could be taken in a sexual manner and he was immediately and genuinely embarrassed."
Who else thinks their sexual chemistry was off the charts?
I Think Tom Underestimated His Opponent... There Might Have Been One Or Two Different Things I Would Have Done Here And There But That Was A Well Played Game... Good Work.
"I know nothing about chess, but watching this video is certainly motivating me to learn the game."
He wants to penetrate your bishop
"He probably went home and told everybody he won. Years later, he will forget that he didnt"
easy to sum up....whore sex and massage chess game....
"Excellent game, and professional production"
Great random rec and great editing vid!
1850 is his rating
I will find more shame spilling water than beer at my local beer bar
Commentary on the thought process is appreciated. And Anna is so engaging.
"I watched the whole video, where did i miss him being condecending?? So many raging feminists with no time stamps"
This guy's never been punched in the face. He talks because if he loses he can pretend he helped. Hate guys like this.
Is she underage drinking?
Why the clickbait video? How was he overconfident?
Great game!
2100
He watched your chest too many times
"You're both weak, predictable players. Sorry, it's true. WEAK Chess player"
Click bait. Scripted!
"If you enter a chess tournament, odds are you will lose half your matches"
"Always awesome videos! BTW, Does anyone know what music was at the background, I'm curious? Thanks!"
His body language with his hand constantly protecting his throat shows how vulnerable her feels.
Yes I want to see the continuation. You are a happy lady and a skilled lady. I like that.
She's like the friendly girl next door but is actually an assassin...
"He's far under 2000, maybe, very maybe1800?"
Maybe Im wrong but in my opinion he seems like a nice guy. To me the tips were more of a nice chat than him trying to mansplain you in some way. But again thats just my opinion
It's funny to see a guy trying to impress a girl when he has no chance with her.
"Tom seemed like a great guy, which is exactly why he's not."
This guy bears all the hallmarks of a narcissist.
By saying the things he's saying he's just showing his weakness.
"Confident, with that hairstyle? Hideous."
"first time i see here videos, and i must say, good game,.. and dang. shes cute:)"
What is flagging?
I told my family I'd love a chess board for Christmas.. I like chess.. Then the algorithm showed me these videos... I have no idea how you play that fast its crazy lol
Grats Goddess!!!
"You're kind of screaming into your mic, back your face up"
just spin the board
Why are players allowed to talk to each other during chess games ? Of course people will try to intimidate/confuse their opponent.
"REALLY, take your time."
I dont even play chess but watching how much you enjoy it; its addicting. do you lose if you run out of time? that would SUCK!!!!!
Thrilling match!
"Because of Anna, I have just started to learn chess."
Idk the ratings Im new but I think its lower than yours!!!!
How did the counter made from 1 min to 5????
Nice
His comments sound like he as a huge ego. And if he would end up losing its ofc because he helped her out ^^
"unfortunately this guy is terrible at chess... but you're cute so you get 1.3 mil subscribers on a ""chess"" channel. the word ""chess"" in heavy quotes."
I want to see you play against big blue.
No eye deer!
I was always questioning why he was always telling me what was the best moves? Ummmmyoure so cute! Did you really miss his move? Look at the way he looks at you and his body language. lol. He didnt want to win against you.
Love is in the air.....just saying........
7:32 he drank to much beer
Nice game
what a tryhard gal
"Great Game Anna , probably between 1700 and 1800. Yes i realy want to see this semifinal."
"AMAZING GAME gezzz, Im not even good at chess, but like, its soo intense loved to find your channel!!"
"Hej Anna, Sann inspiration du r! Vad skulle vara ditt tips att f in min dotter som r 9r i schack? Det r vldigt enkelt att dom brjar med Roblox, Minecraft etc men jag tror schack, ven om jag inte sjlv spelat mkt, skulle vara nyttigt fr henne."
Tom 1200-1400
"When a man is doing something that doesn't seem to make sense, it's usually because they're around a pretty girl... Just sayin'..."
learn how to hold your drink then...i saw nothing intimidating here except your accent
The guy seemed fine and polite. Sort of misleading title
"Older video but I'd rate him in the 1800-1900 mark. He made errors that would have been avoided if he had a better understanding of positional chess. Your play was solid, capitalizing on his errors, and you would beat him consistently."
"Let's be real here, he lost for a greater purpose if you know what I mean..."
Where this so called Overconfident Guy?
The eyes never lie ... and handshakes also reveal much.
Tom's rating is 1609
I this real woman
"Excellent video, thanks for the explanations for me as a guy who doesn't play much chess."
Dude laughs like he's Tom Cruise hahah
Amazing game I think maybe Tom was smitten and fell in love ha
i have absolutely no idea about chess but just love how she beats all those guys lol
Wow he is so insecure. Get him girl.
"Why is the click bait, an overconfident guy rather than simply another chess player. I have lost to women, I have also won against a woman grand master ""she ran out of time,"" in a still equal position. Who cares about a person's sex or age, when playing chess."
Heck yeah Im glad you destroyed this tool feck this guy for trying to get in your head.
He got drunk thats why he plays such moves
Why do yall drink beer and play chess?
. . . what shall we do with that drunken sailor . . .
you guys have great chemistry...
"When he said the b4 move was strange I realized he doesn't watch Agadmator, and was therefore doomed."
OTHER guy is super handsome.
You two should get a room. Youre both adorable.
who showed this girl how to play?
atleast he was looking at the chessboard the whole time
"Well played, Anna! Please bring on more of this tournament."
yay! thanks for bringing me to chess!
Why not go rook a6 after he moved queen d6?
tom 1750
5 OUT OF 10
Idk ratings for chess but Im sure hes decent if he kept you for more than 10 minutes
An autistic girl not understanding when an autistic man flirts with her
If he wins 80% then hes not overconfident. Clickbait title. Also youre slandering him.
I absolutely have zero knowledge of chess but still keep watching the whole videos
1500?
"I find the amount of negative comments astounding. How this could be interpreted as malicious is very interesting. Is his personality to everybodys taste. No, but is it in bad faith, he was smiling and exchanging banter the whole time."
Girl I dont know why Im here but you and your mum rock. Sorry for your loss Tom
Bravo. You won against a drunk guy.
Totally inn love with Anna!
"My name's Tom, too, but I'm crap at chess."
Me encanta como ha mordido el polvo el chulito.
"I recently started playing chess cuz i was bored, and this was so entertaining! Thanks!"
"I wish I could play chess. I know the rules, but have no strategy. I cant plan ahead more than a move or two."
Maybe Tom is a 1600?
Is he not a hustler too ?
I strongly dislike this kind of guy. Patronizing and insecure against a smart woman.
"Nice game & great video! Yeah, he made a mistake by not just simply playing on defense before you got only left 2 minutes. He should defend that pawn instead of trying to invading, attacking and not let your Queen simply in. And he could simply win by making you run out of time. Well, it's always easy to tell what to do in retrospect. He is looks like a very good player, he realised as well the fault in his tactic at this play, tho. Mistakes can happen, plus always room for improvements. ^^"
"Why the arrognat title? Ofc everyone starts the game wanting to win, whats the point of calling him overconfident? He's been nothing but nice. Youre just signaling your own insecurity. Grace in victory and humility in defeat, learn some sport ethics."
"You would kick my - But I love the game so much, even in a loss I love completing !! I use to play a friend who was a master, never won but I kept trying."
men (derogatory)
All the sigma ig reels he watched were for nothing
16:09 whens the wedding?
Thrilling. Great.
Very impressive!
levy was right next to anna idk how she didnt see him
"Both of you have great smiles, chemistry and feed off of each other's intellect and humor. That's a recipe for a great relationship. Im an old man,what do I know?"
Good game
You two married yet or what?
she missed pressing her button at the end
"Damn, the amount of mansplaining from this guy was genuinely painful to watch Great win tho!"
I rate him a solid 7.
At 10:36 was he not two moves from mate? Queen E4 then queen H7? I'm no great chess player and I'm sure that would be countered.
...her Kung Fu is strong....
"Anna is very sweet, but her words are as sharp as her chess"
"Overconfident?? Nah girl, that dude was flirting with you. I don't know how you missed that"
Wonderful!
flirt fest.
She is so classy in the way she beats people....
I'd give him a 1700 at best.
Overconfident guy - you mean a standard English guy? Smug and cant deliver?
Prout prout prout prout prout
18:08. Thanks.
what happened to the beer?
"""and this kids is how i met your mother"" lol"
Purple shirt comment from her! Says it all
His ass was Beat ha ha from jump
"The words of wisdom ""He was drinking beer, I was drinking beer, I didn't want to spill beer"" God bless you lass. Thanks for not spilling the beer."
"Attractive people, sexual tension, beer, chess. Peak life, right here. ""I don't know why we were laughing and smiling so much."" It's called chemistry, Anna. :)"
"I find chess so boring but your videos make it seem like literal warfare, you are so clever"
In my view it would be better without the backing music but otherwise - super! Im no good at chess but I was fascinated by this game and have subscribed :)
he seems to be a londiabaaz
"I've no idea how to play chess properly. I know how each piece moves,I think, but man this video is great to watch. How the heck do you people THINK?! Amazing!!!"
"fantastic video, super super helpful with the explanations as well"
Amazing job Anna. Looking gorgeous as well.
I think his rating is 'cocky' and it was great seeing him flogged.
"Im still watching, but I cant rate his performance as I dont know how to play. I want to learn though, badly"
The first bishop attack was ....foolish.
Really enjoyed this. I hardly play chess but this showed up and I got hooked in.
Well I feel like the real question is did you go out with Tom after you won this session because you seems to like him and his purple shirt
"looks like a check romantic comedy, it seems to me they're in love now"
"I actually hope the best for your chess career...but you are a Hustler. You pretend to be what you are not...to get an advantage on your opponent. You frequently post ""Hustler"" vids...and now I know who the hustler is. You hustle your Mom the most."
Eager is not an emotion a player of chess should ever indulge. That is how you get crushed.
Her: Shhhhhhhhhhh.
He looks like about 1800
It's the start of a chess Romcom
"The titles a bit clickbaity. Tom seemed like a nice guy and both seemed to really enjoy the interaction. Either way, great gameplay narrative!"
I love the way you explain your thought process my nephews are starting to play chess and they are just starting out. I know what to play and the basic strategies but Ive been trying to teach them how to think
Smiling in the face of death!
Great video.
Awesome
"WINNING IS GREAT, but learning to lose is just as important. Well done, Anna."
"I haven't played chess since school and kinda lost all my skill, but I think its checkmate position on 14:24. Just take the pawn and check with rook on f3. There are only 2 options for him and both are, like, doomed quite quicly. Yeah, I know, there's timer, public, style of play, whatever. I just would like to know - am I drunk already, or am I right, or both."
Why he was so nerves
So I need to learn chess.... Got it.
great gameplay
Excellent game and commentary!
Tuff game when you're a Young Man with a Pretty Girl sitting in front of you.
This was an amazing watch. I really love whenever you narrate your chess moves and why you are in your positions. Its very helpful to me. Much love!
Idk and Im sure its a ridiculous position but. You guys would make a great family. Good couple
She is so pretty! Very interesting channel!
"Peak rating of 2175... WTF I just saw? Tom is overconfident? Jeez, it's like 5th grader comes to kindergarten and beat the sh!t out of 4yr old kids. Grow up."
Great job
"I think Tom's about a 1400-1500, Anna C."
The guy in the blue hoody hates Tom
Tom is mixing poker and chess
Chess is such a beautiful game
Rating? On the Dunning-Krger scale? ;)
I'd say his rating is around 1020
The amount of times that dude smiled and laughed is off the charts. Gotta wonder if his face muscles were hurting by the end of that match.
Why do people like watching really really good chess players beat less good chess players.
Now lets see you change oil in a tow truck.
Why does a woman always think that if they can match talents with a man he feels threatened? Most of us feel its impressive. Until you see comments like that. Then your just a cocky woman
"As long as you're playing for fun, drink away. Sometimes when you're playing something serious, like an RPG, drinking can get you in trouble. Like you're feeling kind of cocky and you start talking shit to the Elder of the Elder Elves. The DM was my friend and decided to call it an evening because things were about to get really serious. Negotiations would be ruined and that would have thrown a wrench into all future actions. Moral of the story: drinking effects play."
"I don't rate Tom, i rate you 11/10"
"He played in a cavalier fashion, thinking anything would win; he paid the price."
Looks like nerd foreplay
They were both smiling and good-natured. Both good players. I really didn't see Tom as cocky or overconfident.
Boom!
"never watched a game before but you made it relaxed and interesting, not that I am planning on watching another, but well done."
I like how you explain all of your thoughts in this vid. Beer and chess is perfect
Nothing scares a man more than a woman.
"At three pieces down, was he hoping to flag her?"
It looks like he is really into her!
She's probably editing this video while drunk on the wine she won lol
"Stop with the stupid headlines. You have millions of followers, they all know who you are and you have a camera on you."
Tom = 1600
He wasn't overconfident. Click baity title
1700
"LOL Looks like Tom's attempts to try to ""help the chick"" in chess got him pinned in ways he could never imagine! XD"
"Im not a Chess player but love watching you kick butt. Ive played at some point, but never kept up with it. Keep advancing young lady."
"Next round, please."
Ive never won a game of chess. And proud of it.
Tom would beat her 9 out of 10 times
Have no idea what you were talking about but it was darned interesting.
"Chess proves: 1. You have no personal life. 2. You have not experienced love or ,possibly, sex, as an adult. 3. You have too much ego to spend time reading."
"At first second I thought it's Magnus taking the spot and thought ohh girl, you're f*cked!"
I love that vido thank you ! I just found your Channel and subscribed
1100
Always good to have a man to give you advice
i lost it 35 seconds in at him flexing his muscles for you to pick the pawn color LOL
He could have saved the check mate by taking the knight at the end and then the rook for his queen. Then the black knight wouldn't help finish the deal.
"Still time management is an issue, losing because of that would have been bad."
"Dude: ""The question is, can I beat you in 20 seconds?"" Anna: ""The answer is I can beat you in four."""
Chess - a love story on the battlefield
romance :P
"I must say I hated that guy behaviour, when he started to talk about the best moves and shit"
MY BROTHER AND SISTER...ALL WILL BEAT YOU180...
I spilled a beer at a concert once. I was so embarrassed. You are a great player!
Bet you he had a stronger drink after that game..!!
"While drinking is CRAZY work!! Super entertaining, fantastic job , it looked like yall were having so much fun it made me want to finally learn how to play chess!"
"I don't know how people drink and play chess; my game goes totally down the drain with a single drink. Hats off to Tom, played like a gentleman."
More like Chads-club.
I Haven't got a clue what everybody was doing in this game I can't even play chess but I love these videos they're really funny. What I don't understand is why do you play by the clock I can play checkers and we just play as long as we need to?
I love chess I miss it I already said couldn't guess is rating
I miss playing chess
Oha
"I am SO surprised that this guy doesn't get roasted more here in the comments He shit talked at her within HER moves, which seemed to me like a tactic to not let her think properly. It definitely wouldve affected me in Anna's position with this limited amount of time and i wouldve asked him whether he could shut the **** up :D So, I think he got what he deserved"
His rating is 3 pints of Camden Town Brewerys finest. Thats all.
A mind gamer vs a chess player. Predictable outcome. :v
Well done! Bravo!
"They should have got Anna to play the lead role in ""The Queen's Gambit""."
Anna is the 81st percent
I think Tom played 1200-1600. made some silly errors -
"Started to believe his own BS,"
"I don't know anything about chess, but I thoroughly enjoyed this video."
"He prolly just is in love and all behavior, awkward or not, flows from there."
9:46 hmm it AINT make a good move tap clock they have to think this out? then this is NOT timed chess anymore! TIMED ches ismake a move tap clock take 5 sec make a move tap clock if you dont.. then it is not timed ! He really needs hiks Q so make them ove to allow himto lose his Q
HOW DO YOU WIN AT CHESS? the more you talk the quicker you are gonna lose..simple
No fair wearing that low cut blouse.
That was well done.
"It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom."
Tom is rated 1800?
"I can usually find something relatable in any YT video - a tiny nugget of ""oh, that's cool...I can see how that would be / feel to experience"". Watch a rocket launch - cool. Watch someone detecting for lost diamond rings - very rewarding, love the altruism. Cooking with nuclear decay uranium - fascinating, that must be an interesting flavour. This video might as well be beamed from outwith our galaxy for all the sense it makes to me...."
You were amazing wow!!
Laughing so much is called flirting. I reckon. He thought youre hot.
Checkmate cleavage.
I can beat you. Have not played since 2012.
"You are the Queen's Gambit of YouTube, my dear. Bravo"
2350
I am way to stupid to understand the game. I flies right over my head
"Next time, you might verywell say shut up. just FYI"
Wow
Amazing.
"She couldve won with a single move. Its called the ""STOP TOUCHING ME!"""
"Bit of chemistry between you two. Charming fella. I would have prolong the game any way possible just to play with you longer but unfortunately I would only last 5 minutes with you, on the board that is. Ha..."
Can she beat me at being me?
Dont understand chess but love watching your videos!!
He obviously didnt really try. Its a well known fact in the chess world that women max out at around 1975 elo. In fact the highest rating ever achieved by a women in chess is 2081.
"Being a hott girl is really good for promoting yourself... Most people who follow or watch are probably boys and could care less about chess. Sad but true... I dont know how this video ended up on my feed but of course my first reaction was ""Wow shes gorgeous!"""
"As soon as the match was lost, he immediately stated where he had gone wrong and took the L. Chess is cool. I regret never taking it seriously."
"I haven't played in soooooooooooooo long I would need a complete refresher, but damn, this girl is next world genius!"
You two should date hsha
I don't know how this got to my recommended videos but oh wow you're a real life Queen's Gambit!
I love how Tom can have so. much. fun. playing an unwinnable game
Mies tunnetaan lykkmksi. Nainen itin oli kasvattanut pojasta lykkn miehen on fakta. Siksi miehille matematiikka on helpointa koska sen keksi mies
I dont want to beat you in chess
I challange you to a chess game
I think I know why you were all laughing and having a good time.
I wish I could get into chess. I just cant.
You talk to much. I want to hear the raw audio
"... would most likely get (wo)manhandled by you in a chessgame, but I'd have a pint with you any day whilst getting there ;-)"
I would love to play chest with her
I am no chess player but it was interesting to watch Tom's psychological strategy in this 'battle' situation. He was trying to assert himself as the father-figure/ coach/ helping hand. I found him to be patronising and annoying. You would have been well in your rights to ask to keep his opinions to himself.
Nice game! Cheers!
Such an idiota..he could just eat your horse with his queen...and then it was end time for you...probably he was thinking with his small head...
Nice game. :)
how do you keep finding guys who don't know who you are? Aren't they on YouTube?
drink that beer girl so you can relax omg im so anxious lmfaooo
I too have a purple shirt but i don't have her talent lol
"I know very little about chess and rating, but I would bet there is a rating that's just below what people would consider ""good"" where you can't consistently beat other ""good"" players. If you are someone who can mop the floor with just about everyone below you, but not find a way to beat your peers, then that is Tom's rating."
All I saw was a guy very attracted to you.
I love it when a woman beats a man at chess.
He seems like hes an in person player. He plays like me
Good for you! Congrats!
"Haha how eager he was to put the chess pieces back to the board so no one could see the final masterpiece, which is pretty beautiful and interesting to see, to understand how the game developed, hehe. Nice game!"
He sucks!
Bottle of wine?
Might be 1700 cz anna is 2200 and she demolished him but he got some good moves ngl
"""do you mate me in 20 sec."" -I think that sums up this encounter."
do you show the videos where you don't win
I havent got a clue about chess! But its great to see a woman dominate a guy at chess!
Perhaps he was being a gentleman and let you win? that is my call.
You and Tom - nice couple !
"I think that the title of the video implies that he was an asshole and I don't like the fact that in the end he was a chill dude like I would be pissed if after a match like that, someone uploaded a video of me with a title like that"
Toms rating could be 2270
He was laughing on the outside but crying on the inside.
Off cause I want to see your semi-finals. Tom's rating is probably between 2000 and 2200.
We don't get to learn Tom's rating?
tom was such a dick
"Just found your video on my feed, and I now know that I totally suck at Chess. I'm impressed with anyone that can play at this level, ""very"" impressed! Your narration is spot on and is why I watched the entire video."
"I watch your videos, and I barely know how to play chess"
You two would make such a cute couple!
It is what it is!! Noice.
That was slick.
I love chess
Great job girl
"Difficult to rate someone based on 1 game. We assume that his rating is lower than yours because you beat him. Having said that, Id guess he is 1900-2000"
100% giggly dating chess.
You made some great mewves
1860
Quiero ver a mi mam
"I think the reason he was giving you advice around the start was that he had 2 more mins than you, so thought you weren't considering your time enough; so not sexism, just friendliness"
I'm not nearly at the level of chess these videos show--but I love the good natured entertaining running commentary!
Anna could enjoy the rest of her beer in peace and quiet
The real queens gambit
tom is not a nice guy. endless giggles and un warrented advice. fancies himself like crazy.
I love coming across a video from a person who has mastered their skill to a point where Im so confused about what theyre saying and doing but Ill just assume theyre doing it fantastically
i watched the whole thing. it was a lot of fun
"I hope you both exchanged telephone numbers, you'd make a lovely couple"
That dude should never play poker.
"00:38 smart people will just change a seats, noe a figures! ))"
I actually would not be surprised at all if Tom asks you on a date. You two would make a cute couple. :)
"He asks, ""do you mate me in 20 seconds?"" You proceed to mate him in 4. Bravo."
"@16;05 I am a poorly rated player. A handful of times, especially in the one minute games, my opponents strategy was to ""flag"" me. Sometimes the said opponents would go on a King-Walk which I could not corrale, or other times said opponents builti a fortress which I could not penetrate, or other times said opponents just kept throwing pieces at me which I was not able to digest."
I wasnt interested in chess before but i guess i am now
Nobody notice Tom was getting drunk here?
I dont know chess but I sure enjoyed watching this!
This isn't a A1 game it's a AAAA/1111 game...
I haven't finished this yet... But R.I.P nice guy
He wanted to marry you
Rating would be L
"Of course, we want to see more. Hopefully, all the way to the final."
2:14 is this English ? I dont understand a word of it. yeah Im not a chess player .
"very impressive, great watching you"
I think he is around 1800 level.
"16:50 ""Do you mate me in 20 seconds?"" - is that a chess pickup line?"
You have an unfair advantage one you have a beer and you keep flashing your breast which triggers a reaction.
"All I could think at the end was, ""the prize"""
Go girl. Yes I want to see the rest of the tournament
He soon realised he was in a game! Well done
His Rating is 2300 Elo
You are a legend
Cheese joke he is a thousand bt your a perfect 10.
"Here is my analysis of the game. Do not underestimate your beauty. I would not be able to focus entirely on the game, looking at you. A sincere compliment.)"
"watching her play, I learn so much about playing chess !"
This feels like a date.
Tom is very average. He had loads of spots to win & didnt see them.
"So, the channel is about you playing and kinda flirting?!"
hi
Idk why I never got into chess. Seems like my type of game. I love logic.
i think Tom is a fine dude overall. dont know why he gets hate in the comments.
I think it's bcz he's just drunk that's why he tell truth
bet nobody watches the board
"I know little about the intricacies of chess, but as a psychologist, I loved the disconnect between what was going on on the board and the verbal/nonverbal communication.... It was a beautiful microcosm, and I am so glad you won"
I will love to play against you in chess
"Sharp... I love this. Raising my Chess rating rn, use to be a champion in yugioh and mtg. Keep going, Anna. You sound like my Ukrainian friend, beautiful voice."
and premove the rizz
"Oh One more thing Obviously Ms. Cramling is not a damsel in distress neither ON or OFF camera So trying to psycho analyze the young mans behavior, while playing chess, while looking at a SMART young lady is BS. Maybe they just two young people who find each other attractive and play not only with words, but also with looks. The way he looks at HER The way she looks at HIM BUT HEY maybe all those folks coming to rescue her, feel better after leaving a comment If Psychology where THAT simple"
"Well Lucky me I can stop look asses and rewind, if necessary and I most likely switch OFF sound"
Dont really no much about chess but it was fun to watch you play. Nicx
This is way over my head but so good to watch. Cute
There's a difference between tricky and narcissistic.
Thank you for the commentary. I love listening to the explanation of your moves and your feelings about how things are going
"Thoroughly enjoyable, I think you played an excellent game and what a win with only 16 seconds remaining. Well done"
"Enjoyed that immensely, especially your refreshing presentation. Thanks."
Man i wouldn't be drinking while playing a game i need my brain on. Seems foolish. Also o would keep talking to a minimum to maximize my thinking time and avoid being tricked or giving something away. Over confidence will kill your game.
You clearly fancy Tom.
"Dude missed free knight and queen C5 like Anna mentioned would've been real. From this game, I reckon he's 1200"
I played Chess in High School and College. Then I stopped for many many years. Now I'm playing the Computer. I really enjoyed watching this and think I will watch more of Anna. It was very interesting.
He likes her.. he wants to kiss her.. you know the drill
"First of you videos I watch... and weird atmosphere in reality : 2 false smiles (pretense ? is this word correct ?), a clear ""arrogance"" (from him and his friends) and a ""false fragility but veryyyy high self-confidence"" from you. I won't say more, it's probably cultural difference... probably... but weird... Apart from that the chess explanations are precise and very good. You master your subject, no doubt about that."
Tom is 1500
"Using your cleavage for distraction, thats cheating."
"your channel is better than your chess playing, but I think you figured that out."
I love watching a Tango!
"So, what rating?"
Brilliant!!
Tom talked way too much....
What is your guess as to his rating? I scrolled the comments and there was a wide range with many good observations about his strategies. Im guessing 1600-1800.
Cook
My guess is that he is at least an expert.
Great game!
I love this video where you talk through your thought process on every move. I think I learned more from this than from any other chess video I have watched
I really enjoyed your video and the explanation of your thought process. Thanks
Nice win his rating 1350im guessing
Chess and a pint man that sounds great
Visit Russia
16:07 I would say he is a 2100 .... sober ? ;-)
"Looking at your body language, you can see theres chemistry there. Obviously youre both professionals butyah."
"Your kind of mean. This guy didn't do anything disrespectful or rude, but you try to make him look like a jerk. Your using your looks to cause drama and hurt people."
This randomly came up on my recommended. Love your chess videos!
"From an outsider looking in, he likes you. Good game."
"I haven't played or watched chess in years, but ran across you channel. Great game!"
How durable is that clock ZMF-Pro Clock that appears in this video?
"He doesn't seem overconfident at all, but guy having fun playing chess."
I am not sure Tom was such a nice person after all
"I do recognise that men often feel threatened by able women, and often use bluster and advice tactics to try to undermine their opponents confidence. I certainly dont condone this and the guys who assume they will be better because their opponents is a woman deserve all the comeuppance that you serve up to them, however, the titles of some of these YouTube videos smacks of a similar sort of arrogance that the men are being accused of. This is a pity because the content and commentary of the videos are not like that at all. I still think these are great postings despite that and not being a chess player."
Hes treating her like any other competitor. Yall with the victimhood bullshit
"yes, let's see the semi-final play please!"
"As a man, I decree, that guy is a dickhead."
13:42
"New here, so wait, people just, don't castle?"
0:44 noob question: why not simply turn the chess board (or swap places in case it is a fixed installation)?
"Everyone spills beer in london pubs/clubs, don't worry about it. I once spilled red wine on the friend of a girl I was chatting to 3 times in the same night (I was so so drunk), and she was still speaking to me the next day somehow lol."
Great game
So much fun!
Tom maybe 1200
Shaked is not a word; you shook hands.
Idek how to play chess or anything associated with it but I love watching u play
He was annoying..
Of course the guys always win. Otherwise there would not be female-only championships and tournaments. The vid was scenarized.
1900 is my guess
Easy pickings
Topless!
"You are the first teacher I actually understand,...and thank you for sharing the mental side. I love your game and it just so happens we do the same openings I'm so happy and encouraged about this! Thank you"
Oh hey its that girl that played Trackmania!
"I love it when you beat overconfident guys. Tom sounds like he was making somewhat cheeky comments the whole time too. Love to play you sometime, although am not that good. Beer and chess don't mix, do they?"
"I really HATE when a player do not castle, this video was very satisfying"
"this title of video sucks, he was nice and you both seems to have a good time. You portrayed him as a villain"
Stop saying chack
You ever come to Canada? Don't know if they have any chess tournaments here but I assume they do.
This is my worst nightmare. Chess is fun. Chess is awesome. Why ruin it with chit chat and banter I guess I just found out I can never play in a tournament otherwise I'll just violently bang the chess board on peoples faces. Is it not allowed to be silent while playing chess????
They should have a baby together to create the first human 3000 chess rating.
The only way to make it worse is to ask her out. Haha check mate AND denied. Tom eats a fat slice of humble pie.
How does any of these fools not know who you are?
"Not taking your knight with his queen at 14:14 was the dumbest thing he did, that's why he lost. He needs to not drink while playing. Anytime I play with overconfident players I never lose. The only annoying thing is they never stop talking."
"Hot women will always beat men at not only chess, but at anything they want, at any given moment. Those eyes, that smile, the giggles, the low cut dress pretending to hide the goods with the blue blazer...... Excellent game. Tom never had a chance."
What a douche
"The real bigot here is the female, who thinks every male is like her. If he's nice, its because he is a bigot. If he is rude, its because he is a bigot. If he jokes, it is because he is a bigot. What a losr."
"OK, I have been avoiding chess my whole life and now I am probably going to learn how to play it because of your videos and the way you have formatted the learning aids and voiceover. Instant follow."
1800 guess
"I see what you did there with thw ""I am not gonna say it twice"" :D made me smile"
He says he never castles.I wouldnt brag about that!
it was like a make out session but on the chess board? Anna on top again ...great game
890 rating
Why leave your King in the center at that level?
I love when women win!
Use gender for more clicks more often.
"Very well done Anna,"
"You killed it! Yes, want to see next round!"
Maybe a 1700?
Nice work! YouTube recommended me this video and I dont know who you are but it was a very interesting video. Thank you for making it and thank you YouTube algorithm.
this guy is a puke. probably now saying that he was not trying his hardest. you know the type.
I study body language ... The real underlying tone is that this gent is attracted to Anna. So many nervous ticks gives him away . Can ya blame him love her smile
And this kids is how I met your mother.
I see some Wirtual influence on this video. I like the narrated style
His rating probably 1600
Thats how wars should be decided. Purple shirt definitely has potential
Why is this so fun to follow!
congratulations
17:00 Ne2+
Great and fun to watch
Tom seemed to be too confident and thought Anna wasn't in his league. That's what all the talk by him was all about. He went into the game knowing he was going to win but not taking into account that he could be beaten.
I like Anna
Chack mate.
She's got the distraction tactic well sorted.
"This is a awesome watch so far, anyone got recommendations for intermediate players."
This was fun to watch
"Rating guess before the reveal... at least 2000. Well played by both sides, but the ""no castling"" seemed to be a tipoff that he was the big guy in the club, but not really master strength"
@4:52 Classic head scratching hahaah
I really enjoyed you explaining your process.
Anna the smiling assassin
He is one of the guy that thinks is Good gift to women completely in love with himself.
He Talk so much because He know that He has lost.
Love how you explain it and have fun while playing
When are Anna and Tom going to start dating??
"Dont try to outsmart a woman. Youre gonna get gobsmacked. And then she will be all cute about it. Oh yay! Did I win? And then she wants to date you because youre charming, all after she grinds you into dirt under heel so sweetly. Gotta love them."
I dont play chess but I was captivated!
"What the hell are the top comments on about? The guy was playing mind games. It was as simple as that. If he hadn't shut up halfway through I would've thought that was a reasonable way to interpret it, but as soon as he was well and truly losing he was silent. Always with the extremists, huh? Every single movement with a good cause always needs people to take it way too far and project their beliefs on the most mundane and benign things imaginable. Or maybe you aren't feminist extremists, you're just some self proclaimed psychologists who clearly know exactly what the guy's thinking."
"I reckon he yoyos between 15 and 1700. Gets a few wins, confidence builds, gets overconfident, comes crashing down, thinks hell never win another game, repeat."
*at
This is extra irritating because she seemed excited to compete with him. She was happy to play him and he ruined that by acting like a child.
Are you a grand master?
What do all the hours and hours of studying get you? Can you make money doing this?
Shewing and spitting literally a ED.
Tom went home and broke some furniture.
He was going on tactics. Tryin to open H file as aggresive as he can. He attempted twice. One bishop sac and knight sacrifice. But this just proves that positional techniques are the way to win championships.
I think Tom's rating is flirting with a cute girl.
So much tension
Fantastic!
This guy is a huge ego maniac douche who clearly feels threatened by woman
"At 13:08 you would have an imideatly checkmate in one move with Qxf2 instead of the line you mentioned, right?!"
Hate click bait
As an appalling chess player (I lack patience!lol) I really try to learn from your videos but how can any guy focus on chess when you wear tops like that???
"On the picture on the video you have the caption ""You'll Suffer"". I listened through the whole video and did not hear him say that to you at any time?"
thanks for explaining your moves more clearly. I'm a bit slow. Can you lose because you run out of time?
"I have no clue how to play chess, but this was still fun to watch."
"Idk why this was on my feed or why I watched it till the end cos I have no clue how to play chess I guess I just wanted to see an overconfident guy getting humbled Tldr, I was click-baited but stayed cos it was interesting to see your thought process despite not knowing what is going on lolol"
admit it you dont want to beat the pretty girl in front of you hehehe but she is also quite tough
This was so satisfying to watch!
YES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE.
"early, I would have done knight e-4. enjoyable. Thank you! not sure I would fair well if we played. lol..."
Too busy looking at your...
"My dad learned from my grandfather a cut throat chess player. While in the Maries dad played for money against his buddies my dad is skilled and taught me. He would allow me take back a bad move, explain why it was a poor choice, and give me the option of a better move as well as why I still lost every game. I was dating a jerk, who got a pirate themed chess and checkers set for his birthday and asked if I wanted to play, I said sure. (Dad taught me checkers too.) We set up our pieces, but this was different than playing against dad. This guy exclaimed when he took my piece. I just shrugged at this annoying behavior. While I calmly took his pieces, stated king me and won. Then, he wanted to play chess. I agreed. Since it was a themed set, we figured out what each pieces represented on the board. Again I played calmly. While he told me the name of my opening move, his moves, and stated he learned to play from the internet (theory vs. lived experience, foreshadowing anyone?) he still exclaimed whenever he took my piece. I channeled my annoyance to focus on strategy in game, calmly took his piece and stated check, until I said checkmate. We never played again."
Men
I miss chess with my family and friends
This is for all the men that say women are not smart.
"Who cares what his rating is? Anyone who says ""I never castle"" is lacking some understanding of chess. He will stay a club player, that's for sure."
"No idea what his rating is, but this is a great game to watch"
Good job young lady.
Tom needs to stop playing with his nose then touching the pieces !
Man that was good!!! thank u.
Can somebody point out in the video where he says anything recorded that is condescending and it not being her voiceover about what is happening? Bc from what I've seen this video is 99% her supposition
His body language is so fidgety. It seems this match was his loss from the get go.
He says he never castles is the funniest thing to me .
1800 is Tom's rating I think
"gosh i know nothing about chess, but i DO want to see your semi-finale!!"
2280
He was annoying.
Tim probably is a strong 1300
Absolutely slapped it
Hearing her say she gets intimidated seems like just a nice thing to say for politeness - I have a hard time believing Anna is ever actually intimidated in the game of chess
You guys were smiling because both of you had wet drawers
Somehow you made me watch an entire video about a game I dont understand what so ever haha
"Great WIN, Anna."
Wow! I think there was a whole lot of flirting going on on that board...lol...Love it!
"Sure, you are a physically attractive, young woman, but listening to you explain your reasoning as you rewatch is SO attractive. I'm old and done with relationships, but geez, I woulda followed you around like a puppy dog. LOL I agree with everyone, your educated explanations are invaluable to a novice who thinks the Sicilian opening is an old Soprano's episode."
"Well done Anna., it was an interesting game."
"""He says he never Castles"" Maybe consider sometimes?"
Ate him up
Im so awful at chess
"I've won 3 tournaments in my life and I've never seen chess as something hard. I see it as something very simple. The only people that see it as difficult are apparently smart people which tells me they're not very smart. Chess is easy., take their king and don't let your king be taken period"
What is his Elo?
Levy's Dad & Nepo's Brother Casually Playing A Game Next To Them
"Honestly he is a very weak player and you are not much better, A skilled player would wipe the floor with both of you. I have played thousands of games and while you certainly describe the moves fairly well, your strategy in game is very basic. I have no clue why you chose to make a video where you beat a very average player."
Please add the next games.
"Shook hands, as opposed to ""shaked hands"" but the rest was brilliant!"
You smoked him..
"So you're both laughing about spilling beer and you put your glasses right next to the little timer buttons you have to press every time you make a move, which of course what increase your chances of knocking them over. The fact that you are both smart enough to play chess instead of moving your glasses to the other side of the board indicate that no matter how smart you are common sense is nowhere to be found."
Anna of course I want to see you in the semi finals
"Hi Anna next time maybe order a half pint of beer, easier to manage and less to spill"
"Where are you finding the chess players, who still have no clue who you are?"
"Thank you for sharing your chess tips, and experiences. I enjoy watching chess, and learning. Have fun out there!!"
He so cute ill do him
"I love how u and my sis shared the same name. Live ur channel Anna, youre super sweet and goatlike"
It should come as no surprise that women are good at playing games.
You try to sound modest but you are pretty vain.
would love to see the next round
I guess positional chess beats the bro
Noticed his face was turning red in the end
You Crushed him hands down its always fun seeing you 10 moves ahead off the opponents . But your to nice they try to explain watt they did wrong but you already know watt there doing wrong thats why you Win
She is so pretty I would be sure to loose because Id just keep poking at her beautiful smile
Im so bad at chess that even when you put the lines up I and follow along. Good on ya
he's drinking beer so maybe not his best game. maybe a 1700 rating.
I reckon his rating is around 1800.
"Rating assessment at 16:10 as requested: I think Tom's rating is 2000, give or take."
"Love your videos, Anna. Thanks for posting them."
Impressive ! Congrats
2000 elo rating.
Guaranteed Tom went to an all-boys school - for him this was like playing an alien.!
Tell her what moves to make now Tom..hu?.. nothing?..ok then.
This makes me want to bring my dad over to play because he loves the challenge and plays for fun no matter who's playing against him
"16:00 Tom's rating is better than mine, for sure."
"I noticed you've used the cleavage strategy tactic . Very intuitive . Believe me it works , as a mans mind can be divided even for the slightest endeavor . Usually for Guys with more ego than others , they are thinking way ahead towards ( after the game ) when you do this ."
On the edge of my seat fun! Thanks folks enjoyed
more please
"""love is in the air"""
Have you announced the weeding day yet?
This is the oddest sexual tension I have ever seen.
I love the way you dressed to make him lose focus !! Great move !!
"Brains and B**bs, perfect combination!"
Great finish!
"With enough luck, in the next life you ll reincarnate as a man"
Well done i learnt heaps.
"I think Tom was not used to playing against pretty, charming VERY capable blonde women. Seeing how red his face was at the end tells that story. I wonder if he would've fared better if he weren't trying to engage with you and just considered the game."
"I have no clue what toms rating is, he is much better then me so I cant say, but if I had to guess I would think he is between 1600-2000"
My favorite video of yours so far. I loved the voiceover!
"my knowledge of chess was drawn out of Alice Through the looking glass (just zero), but I enjoy watching this. probably there's a medical term for this."
"1,500"
Tom's rating 2300.
I'd say Tom is around a 1700 - 1800
totally not staged for a video...
What a sheer pleasure to watch. Love the chemistry that churned up all around and how much fun it was to watch. I have subscribed and will be showing this to my elder son who really enjoys chess and my 5yr old girl because she is brilliant and think she would find a role model in you.
There's nothing more satisfying than seeing a woman ridicule a mediocre man who thinks he is the sh1t
Thank you Youtube algorithm.
"Great video. I'm a relative beginner but you made it all easy to follow. After reading some of the comments, I was prepared to hate Tom but all I detected from him was gentle banter and a pleasant attitude which he maintained even as the game turned against him."
Thank you for telling us what you were thinking and why you made certain chess moves..
"Brains and beauty, don't see that everyday. Good job."
"Brilliant Beautifully filmed In England we would say, ""You took to the cleaners Anne"""
Beautiful
"For everyone with their sexist narratives regarding this video... this guy plays the same psych game with every opponent. Maybe he feels like it's more effective on female opponents, idk, but it's essentially just that his preferred means of intimidation is confident table talk. Call your moves and offer tips as a confident authority until your prowess is assumed moreso than seen. Instill fear and trepidation. Our girl didn't bite on that shit, though."
well done girl!
"Yeah, we all know how good you are. Pls shut up."
nice dialogue
You guys should date. Chess chemistry.
Nice game.
It looks like speed dating but you play chess
80%
"I have never been into chess although I am intrigued about it as mind game and I respect those who excel in it. I'm also familiar with chess greats like Bobby Fisher, Karpov & Kasparov as well as our very own Eugene Torre. But I was tempted to watch how you beat the overconfident guy & felt proud of you beating him. I also liked your vocalizations on how you were doing your moves for netizens to appreciate this all the more. Congrats. Hope you become the overall champion."
New fav chess yt :D
When people are drunk they tend to more generally say things without thinking about what they are saying
Toms rating? 6.5/10? You are a funny girl.
"Why is Tom great? Mansplain it to me, lol"
17100
is the board glued/nailed to the table?
Im curious if you played AI?
When the actual queen shows up and sweeps all the kings men.
IMHO Tom is at 1400-1500
This was awesome.
In Chess.....?
Ah bless... someone has found yet another way of being duplicitous and making money
U r blowing my mind with all this strategy.
Itd be interesting to hear his internal monologue alongside this ha
Was watching for when he realizes shes good & I think its when he starts rubbing his neck
Being like ah I couldve waited longer before going in (or w/e) was very.. Well I couldve won
Nah.... don't wanna see the semi-final.
I dont like condescending men Im glad you put him in his place and humbled him! Youve got my vote!
if he wasnt cocky why is your title so bichy
I hate smack talkers.
Good Lord that was sloppy play. 40 years ago before I gave up playing I would have dominated you both.
"That was a great spectator game, Drama right to the last 16 seconds,"
"There's always someone better. Anna Cramling is better than the purple shirt guy, but someone else is better than Anna Cramling. So I don't know what the point is of showing these hand-picked matches."
guys a div
"Rating? U both have higher ratings than me. Thats probably the most correct thing i can say. Not be greedy, but with some time, i could remedy that. Who truely knows. To be fair.. i just realized the importance of chess to me And what has attracted me back into this game. The last time i played i was fairly new to the game. Learning what pieces could do and there moves. A considerable amount of time has passed since when, or then. I was so young back then i also didnt have the attention span. To sit still long enough to play. Funny how the tables have turned. Also how the times have changed. I would go to say that hikaru, brought back life to my sleeping addiction. Called chess. Honestly a blessing. And one needs to keep their mind sharp."
he likes you it seems
They would make a good couple
i bet her knickers hum
the smiling assassin
unbeatable Anna
It almost feels like he gave the win away
"Being ""Flaged"" is a poor way of winning, I'm so glad you kicked his rear, well done."
you make me want to play chess :)
2200
Tom was busy calculating who he would play next after quickly dispatching the beautiful opponent opposite him. Lethal mistake.
"Mind fuck, she didn't buy it, smarmy guy"
"""I really loved his purple shirt, you don't see a lot of purple shirts every day"" *almost every man in frame also wearing a purple shirt*"
"Kicked his f*ckin ass. Love to see women not shying away from situational dominance while also really being themselves. You're a smiley, happy person and didn't feel it necessary to tone that down to be ""taken seriously"" (which some people may not, even though you're clearly great at what you do) don't change who you are because of others! This was really fun to watch and was felt very empowering! Bravo!"
The Queen's Gambit.
"I'd guess his rating is 1900-1950. If you make me pin it down to a single number, I'd go high end, about 1940."
nice play Anna
I know absolutely nothing about chess but how nice is anna? She even complimented the guys shirt
Finally they king takes the Queen
They were both dealing with a Lot of trouble
Chess is a man Game
That guy got You in a Lot of trouble
Love it. Will share with my grandson.
Oh Tom. Big man on campus got his pants pulled down. And now weve all seen the skiddies. Bad luck fella.
RIP Tom
I think Toms rating is 2300
o00oooo This is spicy!!
So many whiny women on here that dont understand Males or competition. Dudes speak like this to other dudes too.. stop thinking your so special and every man is sexist.
That was as much fun to watch as it was for you two to play.
Checkmate on 13:09.. queen on g3
Using the B7 white Bishop to take the F3 pawn would have cleared out the two pawns protecting the King much earlier and allowed a checkmate using the Rooks & Queen. Fun game to follow - thanks!
"I hope you got his digits, you two looked like you were on the best dates ever. I love a man that can handle defeat with grace, while wearing a purple shirt."
Suddenly Im on chess YouTube
"You can't say something again, and say you aren't going to say it again. Just sayin'. Good game."
Let's hear it for positional chess!
"What a wild swing, could be 2300 elo."
"Why ""chuck"" and not ""check""?"
Wonderful game.
"i love your nip slip anna,can we have more of them please?"
you cornered him great
Tom = 2000 .. solid tactic that didn't last.
Very entertaining!
I'd be too distracted by the feminine wilds ... sorry guess that is why I am not a pro chess player =)
"Smart and beautiful, you're awesome!"
Oh how I like your possessions! Seems to me he liked them too. ; )
"If Tom would go for the queen exchange at 07:48, you would have a tough time with 2 minutes down on the clock."
"He is just a d-bag. Trying to man-splain the game in the beginning, and thinking he is sooo clever and sooo smart and sooo charming, but he really is a red flag, one of those ""My friends says I'm a really nice guy"".....ugh! Makes my skin crawl to see his stupid face and smile. Interesting to see how quiet and less.....confident he became as the game progressed and he realised that you were winning and controlling the whole board! Loved to see you kick his butt Anna!!! Well done! But it is guys like this that stops me from enjoying things like boardgames etc, just can't stand them, I just wanna smack their faces....with a brick....hahahaha"
Tickled to death
That game was just beautiful.
Some of yall taking what he said waay too seriously....
Hes trying to flirt with her (poorly I might add)
"Glad you put him in his place. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but also seems like the insufferable/arrogant type when he wins."
About your question 16:15 I guess his rating is 1750 maybe 1800 !?
if she is so good and its looks like she is than walks on pub bars streets and clubs to be shure she win and make opponents foolish is not fair and make her games tottaly not interesting...
why did he clear the board after you picked black? Why not just turn the board 180?
He's not a nice person
the love between you is over whelming
You talk too much!
Thanks that was great... I hope you won the bottle of bubbles
"...that was a pretty bad game overall, many mistakes and missed oportunites from both sides. Cant understand all the votes here."
"His constant talking was annoying, trying to throw you off, but well done on staying focussed. Chess players just think on a whole other level, strategic finesse, calm, brilliance!"
The beer. The beer is why yall were smiling so much
What a superb game!!!
"I made a few of my comments after reading these comments but not really watching the whole video yet. I don't see the guy being a condescending douche at all. He would have probably said the same things to a man that he was playing. He was just playing head games trying to make her doubt herself. I was a pretty good pool player back in the day, and I would talk the same thing. I would tell people what they should shoot or if that was me I would do this and that, hoping that they'd intentionally NOT do what I suggested because they thought : ""okay, this is some kind of trap. He suggesting that I do this, so maybe I shouldn't.'"
"She goes into these games smiling and giggling and has her tiddies all pushed up. She's not stupid. It won't make her beat a much better player, but it'll give her advantage over a dude that's about the same level as she is. At least the first time they play."
2359 bullet
Still waiting for you to move that bishop...
Anna'Baby !
"As a grand master with hundreds of tournament wins I truly enjoyed this chess match. I have to admit though I couldve ended this game in 8-9 less moves. These kids are getting there. I applaud their abilities, especially the stunningly beautiful girl. One day they might reach my level. I hope to play either of them in the future."
1800?
"We need to ban ""women's only"" chess tournaments! It's obvious women can beat men. This is sexism!"
Tom's rating; 2050
"me, with -69 IQ, hanging on to every word of this video and acting like I understand it:"
6 months later are you and Tom engaged yet?
The smiling is called flirting Anna
Turning the board 180 should be obvious to these chessees
Great job
He was so cute.
body language. that guy was more intimidated by the woman player in the beginning handshakes
"Won my sub with this one, phenomenal play"
"at the end he should have taken your knight with queen as it still guarded square your rook was going to then it may have been a little harder to checkmate him maybe I dont know its what I would have done, yes take knight on b6 threatening bishop"
Anna you know you cannot be any more gorgeous both outward and inward.
"I do not know anything about chess. I know how the pieces move and what the goal is, but that's about it. I still really enjoy watching your videos, for some reason. I don't know what the hell is happening, but I love it XD"
You were smiling so much cause you were hot..
I have a nice big bishop for you.
"Do you really think it was good game, he was looking more as a simp to me, this is not how chess should be played"
17:18 hikaru and levi having the greatest game of their life
I have no idea about the chess but i watched this
"He is probably rated 900. Just a guess. He was mesmeized by your stunning beauty, your ""secret weapom""!"
"as a guy, we always take it easy on females. whether they look decent or not."
"With his boyfriend playing at the next table, he showed a horrible level of arrogant toxic masculinity."
"I played chess a lot in my younger years. I went to county competitions, I wasn't great and I'm now crap. You're inspiring me at 34 to get back into playing chess"
What country are you from?
1400?
"""Do you mate me in 20 seconds?"""
"the fact that he didnt take you knight on b6 at the end was a real waste, it was a free piece, that would have free up his queen to pressure your pieces he had time u didnt. AMAZING GAME on your part!!! nice work!"
I applaud you for not talking shit about him but hes an asshole
"Hell, miss beautiful can I play with you chess? 3 moves will be check mate! Thanks"
1800
"You played solid, chess as usual. My guess is Toms rating his Alehouse Trickster."
This felt like a episode of the queens gambit
"4:08 Her: I did not want to spill beer on the people here, so I decided to just put it down. Music:"
Guy vs hot chick = hot chick advantage. Biology.
I think he had a rating of 1950 but was over confident maybe.
He's a jerk. Glad you put him in his place.
Good on ya!
Girl idk how this got on my recommended and have no idea what youre saying but I was invested
Tom's rating? I'd say like a solid 7. maybe a nine in England
"Tom`s Elo rating (against You) is less than 800 . The guy laughs due to embarrassment, because You stripped him buck naked in front of ""his"" audience."
"""I never castle and I hate positional chess"" - ELO 900?"
Am I watching a love story?
I love seeing women own men in anything but it's really frustrating how misogyny makes these guys think they're bound to win if they play a woman. You did an excellent job and kept your cool the whole time despite his overconfidence. He definitely earned a kicked ass
To a chess tournament you go with your confidence under control. Not too high. Not too low. Not being irrespectful to your opponent. Not being scared of your opponent.
"Why didn't he give up? Out of respect, he should have done this a long time ago."
He's cute! lol
You're playing prison chess! The guys that play 12-18 hours every single day for years.
whats your native language?
What was Toms rating & what is yours?
"16:11 he was acting overconfident because he was trying to intimidate politely. He also knew he was very good looking and that you thought so. He wanted you to think that his rating was higher than yours, but I believe his rating is below yours. I also believe because hes a guy hes trying to give advice, even though you are basically whipping his ass. I had a friend a female friend actually my ex sister-in-law who would race Porsches with my brother and she could beat 90% of the guys at the drivers ed event and they would give her advice on how to do it and what she needed to do differently and all she would do is smile and say yeah I managed to get around you without any problem!"
"Ha. The real trick here was to not drink so much; the loser finished his beer by the end, the winner had barely touched hers. Alcohol increases impulsivity."
The amount of men with fragile egos butthurt in this comment section is hilariously predictable.
"Can you beat me in 20 seconds? Sir, she beat you in 5 seconds."
"Not all men, but most only like women who make them feel big and boost their ego. Its cliched, but they really do feel threatened by a strong woman. They feel emasculated by women who are better than them at anything other than cooking and cleaning."
"""I think H4 was strange, Tom. Were in the same boat."""
This makes me want to get into chess
Points on drinking red ale
"IMO Tom's rating was ""over confident private school boy"" glad you beat him. Love watching you play!"
"I'm a weird one where I don't play chess and dont know the fancy play strategies but I do know how to play and I dont ever plan on learning stratagies. I actively avoid learning them because I find it more fun not knowing, so I wont be watching this video incase I learn something vicariously. But I really love that you put the animation there and if my mind ever changes I'll be right back to the channel! Just thought I'd leave an algorithm comment here as a thanks and farewell"
You know somewhere at 13:08 if you choose to move the queen to check with the rook protecting and nothing to kill INSTEAD OF TAKING THE BISHOP?????!!!???
His rating was tipsy with a slight crush. ^^
"I saw you in someone elses video, and had no clue you were famous! You are very kind, well done!"
"Love the video, hate the title. if it was all fun why make the guy look bad on the title."
My rating on Tom? A1 misogynist and I never use that term. He treated you like a woman. He did NOT treat you like any other chess player he plays against. He treated you like a woman chess player. Im so glad you won. Im not saying he isnt talented or skilled. He needs to checkmate the way he treats people. He should be battling against everyone the same. Thats not how he acted or spoke. Bad guy. Not a good guy. Hope he learned at least some sort of lesson.
Queens gambit is becoming a reality folks
"Wait I'm confused, why does the thumbnail say he said ""you will suffer"" when you keep calling him a great guy?"
why did I literally think the thumbnail was Ludwig and QT
"Man im glad you put the red arrows there, I had no idea where he was"
I dont care for chess but came here anyway to see an overconfident guy getting destroyed by a woman because feminism
Muscle man bustin out of that blue button-up
"competitive and polite people, i love that haha"
I'm losing my mind at this wow
You go Queen! The animated board with explanations was very helpful! Haven't played chess in a long awhile and even back then I wasn't great at it.
He was smiling cause he was flirting
"Is it ever unsatisfying in chess because you never actually take out the king, you just say no matter what you do, I will take your king but you never actually take it. Kinda like in the online solitaire games where it sorts all the cards at the end for you, like no! Let me have my proper victory!"
I could watch this stuff all day
i know nothing about chess but this was entertaining
wow. I have no idea what's going on. did I watch it anyway? yes.
"I don't know enough about chess to be certain of anything. However, the idea of getting checkmated by a queen without any other pieces blocking the other moves feels like the kind of thing I'd be embarrassed by. Again, maybe that's just how high level chess goes a lot of the time, but I was amazed at how well the queen blocked in that scenario."
"Everybody talking down on this guy, you should hear some billiard players taunt each other, it's wild. It can be a small part of a strategy. Don't take it so personally. It CERTAINLY doesn't mean he's not a good person!! - Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged."
"I'm not aware of ""flagging""? What is this?"
How the HECK did I get to Chess-Tube?
"i already said it,once im not gonna say it twice . See I love this. Great video and chess game"
"""you play mind games"" this reminds me when i am playing with my brother, it is always the mind games"
"your commentary on this is hilarious, not the black and white fade."
this was brilliant
I didn't know they made a sequel to The Queen's Gambit
"The title is a bit misleading and unfair, isn't it? I'm not sure who's most arrogant here. Two competitive people trying to win. Is he overconfident for being worse than her? She's just better, there's no need to shame your opponent. He didn't even say he was the best, others did (based on his win rate). I don't see the overconfidence. In fact, he's doing the same comments she's doing here, but for all the internet and behind his back instead of to the face of your opponent."
"There was something else going on there, beside the game... P.s. Tom: 1700?"
he almost won
I think he's rated 2200. I absolutely totally want to see how you did in the rest of the tournament
WOW!!!! I'm not a Chess person but that was GREAT and very fun to watch!!!! Thank You!!!!
"Nice, pretty girls make guys smile lol"
dislike for this disgusting clickbait
People are being so rough on this guy and assuming the worst. To me it just looks like hes having a good time playing chess with her.
"""He seemed like a great guy"" did he? Dude was super condescending the whole time."
2140
Yes
Favorite thing to watch is misogynist get owned by their overconfidence
I am a newbie and so enjoyed watching this.
Tbh both of you guys were awesome and I learn so much!
While her efforts should be applauded it must be noted that among the top chess players in the world there are no women.
"Yeah! Suck it, Tom!.... Who's Tom?"
"Dang girl, you kicked his butt lol"
He is newbie
Tom was laughing because he was embarrassed. You beat him at something hes clearly very prideful in and it pained him greatly
Great to see you squash his ego!
I'd guess around 1800. I'd give a lot to lose to Anna. She is so damn charming!
Love to see the semi-final.
I've never understood what the clock was for.
mansplaning...
Marriage proposal - asking you out. 1. Pawn e2 - e4
"Glad you beat Him, He was very Arrogant"
1000
Absolutely
1400
1300 maybe?
"I never got the excitement around chess but i think it's starting to slowly light up in me with your video, great job!"
Misleading title yet again
He drunk tho.
Where can we see the next round please!
"Girl, he was smiling so much because he was flirting with you lol"
"Here it's clear, why she's so often running out of time."
"This was so fun to watch! I really enjoy chess but am no good at it (that's okay of course). Your explainations are so easy to follow and I really think I can learn something from them. Even if not, I get to watch some cool matches"
His rating is around 1750?
We have a real Mallory Greenleaf on our hands here.
Some of the video names are a bit degrading.
Thank you for describing the process of play! Very informative
.... so when is the wedding?
I don't even know how to play yet this video was fun to watch lmao
I didn't find him overconfident. He seems like a polite and welcoming type. It was fun to watch. So much laughter and smiles. It is how it should be.
I'm not a fan of his arrogance. I cant play chess very well but I'd want him to just shut up and play the game lol
"Tom definitely wanted you to ""mate"" him"
Yes lets see the rest of your play
Doesnt look lovely looks like a back Street basement that was abandoned
I would say he is 1400-1600
Is there a reason why you did not just switch places in the begin?
Tell me you have a crush on Tom without telling me so
Yes apart from really exiting chess you are bloody gorgeous
She is fast...she was smiling because she was winning funny .
Did they end up getting married?
yes
"your were smiling cz you got a crush on him, obviously ;)"
"I was smiling, watching you guys the whole time super fun video to watch and to everyone that thinks he was giving her advice to mess with her head. I think he was doing it as a friendly gesture. A lot of us dont feel very competitive when we are having so much fun in a game, its less about winning and more about making sure the other person is having as good of a time as you. I think he was giving her advice to the best of his knowledge, but she was smart not to listen because she needs to play from her own mind and get out from under his anyway , super fun to watch. I have no idea what his rating is regardless so Fun"
1200elo
I know nothing of chess ratings: so I cant make up a number for Tom without being offensive to someone But I made it that far in your video!
"""i loved his purple shirt"" lmao"
"Czech here, wondering if she is gonna drink that beer too or just the foam"
"the guy is so stupid, i tought he was to play like Carlsen, instead is a totally drunk donk"
Don't finish that third or fourth beer when your opponent is barely sipping hers.
Tom can be my king
10:59 why he didnt take her knight at B6? Wouldnt this be the best move for him !?
It's still sad the light bishop didn't get to find his meaning..
"You make watching chess so much fun. I never smiled so much watching a tactical game. I felt you would win the game, but feared you would lose to the clock. Well done. Brava"
Well played!
8:13 the way his body language SPEAKS in this moment yall i.
I am gonna have to get into chess these chess men are so handsome and well mannered!
Youre so cute
Then she took him to bed
"GG's Anna! Is he rated close to you ~2000? Maybe 1800 with another pint, lol!"
"I dont know anything about chess. I stumbled across her Pia video and what I find so interesting is the body language of each opponent. Is it somewhat like poker? Can you tell when someone is nervous? I can see it, but not sure that is accurate."
awesome playing Anna!
"Why is this called ""overconfident man""? You say he was nice? Stop using clickbait. You made him look bad and he seemed quite nice."
Beer seems a really good way to get people in Chess
I enjoyed watching this I know absolutely nothing about chess but I loved watching your interactions
"Algorithm brought me here for an unknown reason. Never interested in that useless game. The only benefit from playing chess is playing better chess, but I still consider it a useless waste of time. If you have fun with it, that's okay for me - but what the heck do _I_ have to do with it???"
She's so beautiful i wouldn't be able to concentrate - too many distractions
He is good but the distress on his face was indicating that you were the best! Thank you!
Is he 2200? He should have resigned.
the moment i could play against a potential GM in the future with that intoxicating smile... i already won
"No idea why YouTube suggested this video. Im not particularly interested in Chess at all, but I watched the entire video just because you are really really cute a great Chess player too it seems!"
Great game of chess
Rule 1. Dont drink beer and play chess
ALL Board Games Should be Taken Hyper Seriously!!!
Just show your tits. Easy win.
(@) (@)
what was toms rating? i dont understand the ratings but maybe 1850?
"It does not seem ""sporting"" to keep commenting on your opponents moves. It would be distracting to me. Not sure about anyone else."
"Ok girl, he was totally crushing on you, lol"
he gives YOU advice
I watched the whole thing but know nothing about ratings. Very interesting & also might be fun for you to date some of them?
"My impression is that he was playing another kind of game with Anna. And that he was fooled. His body language talked. He was not into chess. Not focused at all. He didn't lost in a fair game, in my opinion. That was biased by hormones and seduction. By more powerful rules, with which women play perfectly"
Anna your absolutely great! I appreciate you sharing your experiences !!
Just beautiful:)
Dude was getting tipsy off that brew but her end game is vicious and very well calculated
Yes
"I would love to see the next match there. Tom was really nice though, no snaps, no grim, he took it well and gracious! Although he tried to being sneaky while slightly charming, probably most hypnotizing combination with a lady."
"Anna, you should have told me you were in London. I would have invited you and family up to Oxford. Vince"
"I liked that, thank you."
i'd say his rating is somewhere around 1800 maybe?
He is hitting on you
The phrase A friendly game of chess is an oxymoron.
"I make chess fun! I would fall in love with your personality, given the oportunity! I hope life only offers you the best in all possible ways and that you are mostly happy abouth chess, love and health!! Cheers from BRazil!"
"I enjoyed the video up to 16:05 where you told me to comment - I think Tom's rating is 1900. But I'm a noob, its hard for me to focus long enough to even understand most of these games, but I love your vibe and how you make Chess a positive and cheerful experience and a joy to watch. Thats where you shine even over your lovely genius Mom, Pia (which takes some doing!). How did Tom not recognise you if he likes Chess??"
My younger brother is a great natural chess player. I love playing him just for the mental exercise even though I get crushed every time. (I'm a pro poker player! LOL) This video and graphic explanation of higher-than-mine chess concepts was a great help to opening my eyes to how my brother sees the game.
"The worst thing about chess is all the blah blah blah. I just cannot concentrate with people trying to hold a conversation. I can only do 1 thing at a time, either talk, or play. This was a really fun game to watch!"
Guys play this psychological game sometimes. Its all fake just to throw you off. Im a male and other males try to do this to me. If you are a woman dont think he does this because you are a woman. Men do it on other men the most.
Dude was crushing on you hard core. That was a cute matchup to watch. Im glad you kicked his butt
Overconfident is also to assume that you can't be beaten by overconfident guys. I know what you intended to say but the video title spoils your message
"i love the commentary, humility and humbleness is such a gift to be enjoyed by others. watching your moves play out brought a smile to my face. real chess"
2000 rating
2100
"So much ""The Queens Gambit""-vibes"
1800
"Funny, I do not even play chess, I know the basics, but don't play the game, somehow your video popped up on me and I have already seen couple of them and I have to admit it is interesting to watch"
You should have played Queen Gambit instead of Anya Taylor-Joy
"yes, more please"
I know nothing about chess and I dont know how I ended up here but Im glad I did . Great job.
I see both of them to be Asexual individuals.
So...his rating was...?
This is how I met your mother...
Beers make people smile.
And you two lived happily ever after....
Chess is life.
Your attire definitely had an effect on the game.....His mind was stuck on you.
I love it. You both seemed like you were having a great time
he smiled... yup overconfident
"this politeness feels like narcissistic idea of dominance. She obsessed with winning the game. Be careful, in case youll lose - there might be a break."
have you feld mansplained at some points? I enjoyed the game!
"Ana, your enjoyment of this best of all games is infectious. TY for your videos."
"I'd probably drink too much, do they have cider there ?"
"2:22 I knew he was sweating cuz he rubbed his neck. If someone touches their neck or rubs their fingers, its their giveaway theyre feeling insecure"
Stop with alcohol please
you all were laughing so much from flirting ;)
YES
1876 is his rgt
He was mindgaming because you were good
"Great game, wish I was in London at the time. But Ill visit that club!"
What a beautiful game
"Anna is so polite talking about how nice smiley Tom seemed, but on the inside you know she was thinking ""this guy is annoying AF!"". A very satisfying win!"
you played as a pro that was cool to see
1850
I really enjoy hearing Madame Cramling's thoughts about the position in these videos. Looking forward to more videos.
"in the end he was ""over laughing"", he was really annoyed albeit good at trying to hide it"
Lager man will never beat a IPA woman
What is Toms rating ??????
Definitely lower than your rating .
Fun match!
Only Americans find a purple shirt on a man noteworthy. Its the homophobia in their culture. Purple isnt manly. How ridiculous is that?
Hmm. Great win. What happened after?
farming some nubs :)
Is Tom's rating 1800-?
850
What was his rating!?
"Looks like he's playing some ""romantic chess"" leaving the king unguarded in the middle, almost ""flashing"" come get me - I would have given him 1850, however I also believe he might have played badly on purpose. No way he'll win 4 out of 5 games with that playing style in his club. Nice game, though"
"Not a great guy. He's passive aggressively tying to mentally dominate you by suggesting moves and ""helping"" and then pointing out your time ticking down. He knew he couldn't outright beat you, so he started playing head games to get you off balance."
Tom is 1700?
Honestly I put Tom somewhere in the 1600-1800 the classic Im the best of all my friends territory. But doesnt really compare to people who play chess full time
I don't know a thing about chess but I could feel the excitement of the match. That caused me to watch the entire video! PS. It also got me to subscribe
Sometimes Im embarrassed to have a d*ck
After Bxe4 (13:02) Qxf2 can be strong.
"I don't know a lot i'm 172 how would I know with my ""skills ""."
1000
I bet you use a vibrating butt plug to get morris code... Don't blame me that's what happens when A chess master is accused of using a vibrating butt plug to cheat at chess... I'm also not sorry for making the joke.I'll make it again
nice video
"At 1050 (daily), I'm not good enough to guess what Tom's rating is. A lot better than me I can tell."
Tom es puro ruido!!
wanna see the next rounds
There are four guys with purple shirts in the frame when you check mated him
"Don't know chess, but she is cute!"
"Stop telling lies about tom saying that he said you,l suffer. Stupid woman , lier and checy"
"You are a good lier, you can't control 100% if you drink bear or . Checy woman"
France is full of pricks...FU France...your country stinks like Bidens dirty diapers and your food sucks!
Anna actually won? I cannot believe it!
His rating is 1200
he wanted a check-mate to mate with perhjaps?
"Tom played with his balls. He was showing off. His bollocks impaired his judgement. Not unusual. A tad rude too. Talking to disturb concentration, plus trying to intimidate. Perhaps deliberately. But with his balls doing half of his thinking, he did not see that you saw straight through his bravado."
Good talk-through. Shame about the yet again misleading and ultimately dishonest title.
"Wonderful game. Very engaging. Thank you. What, though, is going on with some of the commenters. Snarky. Is chess a magnet for that sort of thing?"
"Seems winning was more important to you than him in this instance for whatever reason. He was completely honest and you labeled him tricky. Maybe Tom wanted to be gentlemanly or was smitten. No offense, I dont know much about the game and youre obviously very good but his behavior lacked competitive fire."
"Wow gg, now i feel like joining that club haha. It looks like lots of fun."
"His vulnerability lies in his indulgences and his excessive deference. If he had overcome these flaws, you would have faced defeat. He must cultivate strength and resolve."
"His mistake was taking the bishop, otherwise solid she was draining the clock."
gg!
Good girl.
I think he just likes you.
Really interesting! First chess match I've followed in this way (I'm a beginner). I'll watch n learn some more!
"How is this guy acting like his an ""Overconfident Guy Thinks He Can Beat Me In Chess""? He was completely nice, so your comment is very unfair to him. You should be ashamed to falsely accuse someone like this. I will never watch you fake channel again. Unlike and unsubscribe."
"So, how are you guys after 4 months of dating? ;)"
The purple shirt looks good on him but it does not hide the fact he was devastated. LOL Well done Mylady.
"Not fair. She has her boobs out, and that's a big distraction for men."
She be mating him for sure
"You are me when I was younger. Hint, don't drink.....better to win."
the commentary really helps novices understand what the hell is happening
One aspect of mild cognitive loss from a brain anomaly that randomly put me in a coma for five days is a loss of ability to move things in space in my mind. I can tell my window for learning chess has closed. It is more interesting to see how fast a game can go and younger participants with laughter.
She has a personality Ive rarely seen. And a great future.
"Watch your drinks, kid."
Sometimes salesman will distract people with a flashy smile. Do women chess players sometimes intentionally distract their opponents with flashy cleavage?
she stepped up a lot since I discovered her on yt few years ago.
This was exhilarating
"Absolutely demolished him, wow. Pretty clean game from you."
Did you have sex with Tom?
"So...Tom wasn't overconfident. He was a decent guy. Oh yeah, and wearing a lapel mic and someone video-ing the game wasn't a give away that this was for a purpose. As if none of them knew you were a FIDE Master. So, more about the clicks then."
Porque no comias el el peon de el con el alfil cuando tenias la torre en una buena posicion.
Well of course I'd like to see the next round. Thanks for sharing.
"4 moves in, he was done for"
"@15:00 Wouldn't queen to D2 have been checkmate? Serious question, I haven't played chess in years."
GG
Where is the part where he was overconfident? Did you kind of shame him on your channel for something he was not ?
Your videos are great but the titles are always shitty clickbait. Threre is no need for that
probably ~2000
Is there a bit of chemistry here or is it just me?
"so why dont you play a World Champion, maybe a coward"
"Not mistaken, he's a fool trying to.."
"I bet this guy smokes ganja,... Or he was nervous watching his own demise..."
"Yes, this type of display is cool Anna. Me mola el juego as!"
That was AWESOME!!!!!!
"Overconfident? that's you, and you need to be humbled."
I'm very new to chess. Can someone explain why the king was to the left of the queen? I thought it's supposed to start on the right.
"D-Liteful watching you play chess and how much you enjoy it, Anna! Yes! Lets aee the rest of it!"
"Anna gooide haar borsten in de strijd , afleidingstactiek"
great video
I think Tom is under 500
gg!
This is my first time watching you play. I love how you talk through the moves that you make. It's very helpful. Thanks!
Whats a chess hustler?
Tom is barely 1620 ore 1650
Exciting game
I did not like his smiles
16:05 id say tom is 2000
Oh come on! He fancies the pants off you.
I think he was rated 1600-1800 or so...
"Your accent is so weird. You say "" savan"" instead of seven. And ""mewv"" instead of move. Is that a german accent or something"
His rating is 1750 at best. Lots of missed opportunities.
"01:48 ""the winner goes to SFinals yea?"" The best kinda trash talk!"
I hope it is not too late for vote: please show the video where you dropped the beer on the chess board!
say it twice!
"You can't be that good at chess, if you're questioning if/why he might have been helping you..."
my guess his rating 2400
I know my rating is only 458 but believe it or not I won a 900
"SMART woman--go girl, go!"
It was clear to me that all he tried to do is kill your time.
"That's why we love Anna, so well spoken, lively and talented. And of course, beautiful."
Good game
"I don't see why so many people are so against what guy does. I see that what he was saying is manipulative but since it's a competitive, I don't think of it as a bad characteristic at all. I feel like it was always clear to everyone that it was just some messing around and nothing to be taken too seriously or some kind of ego problem of his..."
Anna: I don't see purple shirts everyday'' Is that because you don't see Levy everyday
I want next round
Awesome game
you both are so fake. You both only want to win. Fun is 2nd place for you both.
W
The way he keeps putting his hand over his throat is a classic body language sign that he is feeling threatened.
Would see semi
"bravo, bien jou."
He talks too much..
"Simple, Tom should've thought more with his big head, less with his little head."
this was tom oh my god did you kill him
"LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTARY WAR BELOW, WE CAN'T HELP BUT TAKE THE GENERAL RULE, BECAUSE THE DEBATE HAS BEEN TOO FIERCE, ABOUT SEXISM, ABOUT GENDER, ALL BECAUSE OF ANNA PLAYING CHESS. ALL AGAINST GUYS. WHAT'S IN ANNA'S HEART, WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW, BUT, ANNA KNOWS HER SKILLS AND THE SKILLS OF HER MALE OPPONENTS. SO, NOT TO BE TOO LONG WINDED, IF ANNA MEANT TO MANIPULATE THE FEELINGS OF HER MALE OPPONENTS AND THE MEN WATCHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA, LET ANNA GET HER KARMA, AND ANNA CAN'T BACK OUT OF IT, AND ANNA WILL DEFINITELY GET HER KARMA IF SHE MEANT IT, BECAUSE ANNA HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR TOO LONG, AND IT'S TIME FOR ANNA TO GET HER KARMA, AND IF ANNA PLAYED AGAINST EVERY MAN FOR FUN AND FRIENDSHIP, THEN LET ANNA GET HER FUN. !!!!!"
"With sound turned down, body language says he was very nervous right from get go."
I think his Fide blic rating is like 1870 and You should tell us what his rating really is? pls
I can see why he lost... he finished all his pint of beer while you barely touched yours during the game...
"I'm intermediate at best, but at around 9:00 into the vid, why not move the right rook up to threaten his queen with cover from the bishop? Asking cuz I wanna improve! Fun game to watch, though. Congrats on the win!"
Something tells me Tom got his rematch off-camera
I loved your Win. He fully deserved it. He should've bought you a Pint.
Well done! Such a pleasure to watch!
I could see you 2 dating....
He is completely into her that's why he is smiling
the biggest blunder was in his glass. His second blunder was not forfeiting once you took his knight
"I don't think he's rating is that good, he made some mistakes, that's what I think."
"That bishop gambit/pawn, i win 95 percent in 1 min blitz."
"I really enjoyed the game ... Yes! keep 'em coming, thanks."
You should f*ck eachother
He's rating is about 1700 I think
That was a demolition job...
"I liked how you squashed his pride. You did a terrific play in calculating! If you answer, I would like to be challenged by you."
"So Tom, how's never-castling going for you lately?"
You won because you use your boobs to win.
"Rubbing his gums, sniffling, constantly sipping his beer, weird movements, nose checks etc is a sure sign of dehydration and cocaine. You look sober as can be. Given your previous spillage. lol that happens :)"
This game felt so gooood... and beer too !
really great game ! great words so I can learn a little more
"I dont understand chess, but I cant stop laughing when watching a woman with a razor sharp mind outwitting her over confident male opponents!"
"I beat Tom many times, bring it on"
Yes
"Anna, we all want all the games and banter. Your fan base adores you completely."
What was Tom's Rating Anna?
This video smells like feminism
"THIS video made me following you, even being myself a beginner in chess ... and not a good English speaker. I was taken with by this game and the way you describe your strategy : it's a master class ! Oh, I forgot : yes, I want to see the next round !"
His rating is too much beer 4 today!. Gg.
Sounds like Tom should slide into the DMs!
"He played average, trying to distract you with his ""charm""... Baseless defence, nothing but bravado. That is why he was pointing to your moves, because he see his mistakes after he commits them and can't keep quiet about it"
1700
How much advantage is cleavage distraction worth?
"if there would ever be a chess reality show, these two gorgeous people could do that."
Id like to see the next round.
Loved hearing your 'internal dialogue' and your reasoning behind your moves and his counters. Very interesting and somehow it quite satisfied my chess strategy curiosity.
His rating is amateur because he was trying mostly tricks and then fell completely apart when they failed.
"Interesting game, well played."
800?
"Anna and Tom, interesting match ;)"
What a disgraceful lying title. Who do you think you are?
"Bueno, vengo del canal en Espaol. Let's enjoy your videos!"
Anna is such a Lady and a fun-girl...the whole package in her humanity. Her sense of humor and affability and approachability is stellar. Her parents did a fab job raising her.
"After playing trading card games my entire life I have to say your explanation on the game made it very easy to follow. This is my first chess video I ever watched and I was able to understand and follow your thought patterns. Chess seems like every other game. Statement, response, out trading resources and taking position"
Why didnt he just rotate the board in the beginning ? lol
Bro I think he has a rating of 2700 and above
well as I have said before .....Anna Cramling is the nicest player around (A beatuiful mind)
Ill guess 1600 to 1800
This was a great game
"This was a great match to watch. Yeah, Tom is a bit cocky, but I think that comes from him winning so much of his games. A bit condescending in giving advice midgame - it is a tactic to rattle the opponent. I've done it myself. But he's a decent chap and took the loss in stride. Well done Anna. Great playing."
This game and commentary/animation got my sub.
So cute together
"Hey Anna, who writes your video titles..."
Thats headline is a bit unnecessary
I see no evidence that this gentleman approached you with an overconfident attitude. Why do you say this? This is like saying you're a lush because you have a beer beside you.
"I dont think hes cocky, just good banter."
"""I was happy with my move be-4"""
Rumor has it that he is still crying at home today.
Bar chess is the best form of chess
"I know probably you heard this a lot.. but i've to say: ""You are most beautifull and good at chess woman i ever seen"". I wish i could meet you. Really nice match! (i'm super noob compared to you at chess)"
"I'm based in London, which club is this one Anna?"
"I'm not too familiar with chess terminology, but what word does anna use at 3:44 4:24, ""calm""/""cool""/? moves?"
"Anna, you are so much fun to watch! I love your enthusiasm for the game, your positive attitude and boy are you cute!!!"
love your chemistry lol
Staged woke BS.....
1000? 900?
Yes - semis.
"I really enjoyed your commentary, I learnt a lot"
I think his about 2000
14:02 the guy could eat the horse but didn't notice that
Nice game Anna!
Does the beer help?
Wow! I'm impressed!
Anna with Crush on Tom
"Tom seems like a competitive but nice dude, having fun and drinking beer. Yall are so harsh on people you dont know."
"Brilliant play Anna, well thought out too."
I should start playing chess
he is good
I could watch your games all night!
I'm seeing a lot of flirting honestly
5:50 I loved the woman winning in the background - so cute
His rating was probably 1200
"The chemistry between these two is real. They're constantly smiling and laughing and teasing. They both enjoyed this rivalry, no white knights needed."
funny how theres almost none in the comments talking about his elo ranking
this guys laugh creeps me out lmao
"I'm like a 1/3 in, this guy doesn't actually have a clue what he's doing, does he?"
Anna and her beer problems. I remember the video of you pouring a beer... that video was the best.
So he's not a street hustler??
Go Anna go!
Maybe 1600 rating. I thought he played very unconventional!!!
so now chess rooms are the new tinder?
wow!!!!
"Brilliant video, very entertaining. And a brilliant match, congrats!"
He underestimated you. Congratulations for the winning!
Why does everything have to be abour race or sexism? Wah wah wah
gg lol
Woooo Anna!!! I am so happy that you won!
1700
"He wasnt masking anything, he was just flirting with Anna. Ofc, she is such a sweet, lovely and smart young lady. If I were him, I asked her out on a date after she bet me"
Good win Anna..love to see next round.
I think his rating is 1500
How anyone can focus on the game when playing against her is beyond me.... Absolute beauty and brains is the ultimate Aphrodisiac...
He blundered a lot. I would say He is 1700
"I put Tom on 1600-1700 Elo. Knowledgeable enough to have a solid plan but not enough to pivot away from it once it fails to deliver. Also that YOLO attitude he has suggests just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous but not enough to truly be threatening, if that makes any sense."
He's used to telling girls what to do.......that is disturbing...
Shook not shaked.
This was a great watch. I was on the edge of my seat!
Hes not a master
Proud of you Anna
I'd guess he's 1900. Correct? Good game.
"Im a average player but this is my dream type Gorgeous,well spoken and such a tacticsian. I bet your the most awesome conversation ever"
He's smiling because your top is too low and showing too much.
6:33 is that @Gothamchess?
"That was beautiful. Loved the taking through it you did, explaining, thought process, etc.. i wish i could play you so badly and just play a million games with you. I really like and admire your personality. Respect"
I loved this your explanation was amazing throughout the video and glad you beat him
Good Luck Pia and Anna!
I think you missed him flirting with you 16:48
"Clickbait title, didn't see a moment of overconfidence, ""what do I want to do"", ""what is that move Anna"", tried some mind games. doesn't come across as over confident to me, if anything Id say these were signs of a local chess club player being under confident against a Master. I think if anything, Anna's demeanour is under confident too, second guessing, taking longer to make moves, only having a sip of beer and worrying about dropping it. Not really surprising though being in another country at local club, I guess this is quite an intimidating experience."
Legend. chapeau!
Amazing how well everyone in the comments knows this guy
the sexual tension is palpable
great game. i learned a lot by watching you. I appreciate you how you show all the possibilites. and would like to see how you did in the semi-finals.
"You like him, don't you?!"
If your opponent doesnt move his rooks you are in for a toughie
"He wasn't smiling because it was a friendly match or his opponent was charming. He started smiling and talking, because he got nervous. If you listen closely to WHAT he said, you'll realize he stopped believing in himself at a relatively early stage and trued to distract his opponent. And exactly what he said, were either lies he tells to himself or things he wants his opponent to ponder about - instead of thinking about a clever plan. It's all simple psychology."
Love your videos You're so right when you said it's all about having fun and that's for every game or sport. It So much fun Thank you
Go find Tom
Qf6 at 13:10 maybe...
"I know some people don't like Tom for his way of ""distracting"". But this is actually a part I appreciate when playing chess in public/face to face. That your opponents can be all sorts of people and some of them even try to do some mind games. Making the game more than just chess."
16:00 I don't know what his rating is but I know he's flirting hard!
love a sharp pretty one!
"As per your question, I think Tom is around 1700."
clickbait
Tom got them cheeks opened up and got penetrated.
"Tom's rating was UNDER-rating your abilities. Tom flirted away the game. ""Mate me in 20 seconds"" was very funny."
"When women take a sip of beer from down below, they're really trying to distract by bending over and showing cleavage. She and other women know what they're doing. I am a guy that loves cleavage and breasts and I definitely would not be able to play with a clear mind against this girl or other women. Same problem playing cards."
I just like skipping to the end when you beat your opponents. =)
"wow I love Chess but I suck at it, but this is so much fun to watch! YOU ARE THE REAL LIFE QUEEN'S GAMBIT!"
"Men of culture, we meet again"
Brutale Sau
I made it but as a straightmale its hsrd but I'd rate em 8/10. 1 point taken off for style which he has just not the type I do and 1 for not being a girl. Besides that he seems to have a lot going for him.
yes next one
Can someone please explain why so many comments say Tom seemed like a bad person. I mean what things did he do that made people interpret him as such?
Its over 9000!
I watched this video on silent. The whole time i knew that guy was douchey and his ego was hurt.
1600 rating
The mansplaining on this guy is on astronomical levels
This was the most flirty chess match I've ever seen
"With her accent, sounds like ""my eyes were on the chuck meat"""
he made a single mistake and you capitalized congrats thats chess
Just keep showing that side boob and you'll continue growing ur channel
Why are you listening to himtic tic ric :) Bravo for the win :)
Any 2100 patzer can beat you AT chess.
He should have asked; - So what does your mom do? - Well she's a chess grandmaster. - Really! So what does your dad do? A grandmaster too? - Yep...
This is the first time I have watched one of your videos. It was so much fun!! Better than Gotham Chess - he's so intense
"Its because her sagy puppies were out,,, how boring of a life yous people have down there,,"
what a creep. both of you.
"Hay, man and women can't compete in sports. That's totally unfair for the man. I kid, I kid"
Look eets fuggen luvleh @ Anna Cramling
love how good natured he was an how red his face went
/chass/? What accent is it?
Well done.
Girl is so beautiful
"Well done! :) This video inspired my to try chess again, not done it years. Downloaded an app and yep.... I suck! Lol :-\"
He plays psychology against his opponents. He uses his BS along with his play !
tom playing her: thanks that was fun can't wait to see the video! Video gets posted tom: ...
"Really awesome narration there. Beer, laughter, smiles and a tactical game of chess....you're living the dream :D"
"I want to see the semi finals. I have been playing chess for a loong time. My friend and, I while standing in line at Disneyland for a ride would be playing on a miniature chess set. It took a way the time. I used to belong to a chess club in high school I was pretty good. I would love to play with you. I was impressed with your gaming style. It was a good match"
I was smiling too for the whole macth :)
"Great!! Tom was a little bit poisonous, just a little bit"
"Poor Tom. Cocky, smiley...and leveled."
Great job
"Tone it down a little, 'ay? You are too good looking. It's very distracting. I just come here for the chess, not a Scandanavian beauty pageant."
That sounds soo fun!
This is pretty common in poker
Dumb videos
"Semi match pls, Anna."
"What's his rating, Anna?"
"There was a lot of flirting going on, and some chess."
"Well done! Tom didn't have anything for you..way to defend and win with Tom trying to take you out with a aggressive attack..anyway, hope you won.very nice tactical game;)"
"sooooooo, what was Tom's rating?"
you ned to date him
Most important: You smiled and kept your beer intact.
Well done Anna ..John ..Oxford
Stop with your high pitched aggressive voice. This is not tournament chess where all good chess players are
just focus anna
More Voice overs pls :):)
Thanks for teaching GG
"Tom seems like a lovely guy, not an arrogant chess bro."
1850
16:09 - His rating isn't that high he made too many blunders. Not castling is not an advantage. He gave away advantage as he let you off the hook @5:13 - He should have moved his Bishop back to D3 instead of Bishop takes Knight.
It sounded more like he was anticipating before actually playing you and it threw his entire game. Not alway through tho
Is he drunk?
14:50 he should have gone King e1
I always thought females would be better at chess because the female brain has evolved to be very good at multitasking. I can only handle one task at a time.
I have a question. Is there a reason why you didn`t turn the board 180 at the beginning?
1900
We`d love to watch next round
Chess is so fucking annoying!
What's Tom's rating?
That was a good video.
Hes so hot. Shes spoiled she got to play with him.
He let her win please
"My guess is around 1950, he valued traps over solid development and didn't expect solid responses. Did you play any friendly's with him afterwards Anna?"
You are a couple ? I surely believe you are liker that with every Guy
"02:19, I loved that move. Well done!"
Opponents who keep a running commentary on the game are so irritating. Opponents who try to play your game for you are worse. Opponents who do both? Well...
Fun to watch!!
1800
I freaking love your voice and commentary
1700
"Tom's rating: 1820, my guess."
"I think his rating is garbage he didn't castle, got several of his pieces taken by pawns and tried to win by time, only to get washed in the end. He should've just moved his pieces out of the way of the pawns"
"chess and alcochol :] i beat ma granddad in chess only once. and i was able to do it only because ""he gave me a head start"" and every time when he captures pawn or figure had to drink a shoot of vodka... we played few rounds that day... and im still proud of myself of that win even if it was 21 years ago and because he was so drunk that he pushes the pieces on the chessboard to get to the square he wanted, because picking them up and placing them on a specific square was burdened with too big a coordinate error. it also reduced collateral damage to adjacent chess pieces :]"
"0:51 where are Anna's eyes, and where are Tom's eyes"
I think Tom is 2200
Love how she cuts out most of convo and only inserts parts to fit her bs woke title. Guys would do that to other guys. Its a Strat to throw opponent off game man or women. What a joke this click bait false title is
Title is either click bait or lying woke crap. He didnt act cocky or over confident. He played like a normal person and also respected her as opponent. Total bs
You make a cute couple!!!
"Actually I never liked chess, but absolutely loved the show ""Queen's Gambet"" and now I watched this whole video 'til the end - fascinated! :D You are like a continuation of that show a little bit..."
"Oh man, what a fun game. I played chess as a kid, didnt really like it. And now, looking at chess as a computational problem what a strange thing chess (and also human brain, and also computing) is."
"14:00 why he didn't took a knight with a queen, but instead moved with a pawn?"
Well played. I don't think Tom was that happy inside.
"maybe its cause he was drinking and took you casually, if not hes around 1350 im guessing?"
He was hopefully being sarcastic saying the never castles. ..
"When a woman is not truly beautiful, she uses her breasts to distract men"
Its funny women say they don't want to be objectified but then she's playing Chess showing all the cleavage she can. Why do you think she's doing that? Be honest
Girl power
Is there a link to the semi final?
beat me at starcraft and I'll be impressed.
0:39 why dont you just flip the board?
tom was solid but not on your level... id say 1850-1950
1500-1600? about his rating.
Man he was cocky
Loved this game
"I am terrible at chess, but you were a joy to watch"
"As a non-player, Im captivated"
Someone has a crush! Great game with a nice win and very sweet to watch.
Awesome playing. Great job.
She's so into him
Thriller
Tom is Elo 1400
Flirting Flirting
"16:27 white square bishop takes p3? ... next move is mate, I think... k, maybe 2 more, lol"
"I know nothing about chess, but I'm enjoying watching the videos. I like it when someone is cocky and you win."
"Great game, great feeling overall. I think he likes you"
and then you had sex
Hey I'm reading these comments and not one of them say how good of a game you both played tactics are a big thing and that goes for mental tactics too mate. I think you know who I'm talking about. He was condescending on multiple quotations and i think that's what the lady in the comments was talking about. He was a nice guy but he has some mental tactics that didn't work. And as for the arguing in the comments. Please people respect her video and leave the bickering out please. Your beautiful and you play a good game girl. I am now subscribed
Pretty sur they ought to check for bodies under his patio. What a creepy fucking man
"@matthewlove4082 this guy was very gracious in defeat and she was gracious in victory. Youre just trolling and trying to virtue signal to toxic feminists and start some kind of argument. Youre picking the wrong dudes to date and trying to blame it on all men. Instead of being angry at the world, level up and work on yourself."
Great to watch!!
"He's probably between 1750 and 1900. All the laughing is to be blammed on the beer, we don't know how many he had before playing you. . Plese show your next game."
Tom Is maybe 2200
Chackmate
"Beating an ethanol junk whose brain is clouded by alcohol, must not be that difficult. You may be intelligent, but a hard drug like alcohol affects the brain in a negative way that disrupts focus and making bad decisions, but as any alcohol junkie should, the kick of the ethanol is more important than the game it self. Have fun with your future breast cancer caused by the carcinogenic alcohol you adore so bad."
"""I don't see a lot of purple shirts every day."" I don't know which is better, your chess coments or the casual observations of Anna's life. His rating doesn't matter, he played lame, after that atack on the king failed."
"I don't 'play' chess but a quick question. Why do so many people who do appear to be narcissistic, adhd, unpleasant f*cktards (boys and girls)? Love to all"
"Thank you, Anna, for this positive video and for being a great ambassador for the game. As a relative beginner, I find your content accessible and motivating. Your love for chess is obvious and inspires me to learn more."
Bravo!!!
That was fun.
Makes me want to take up chess after dabbling with it as a child. As a game it's so intense and demanding mentally.
La cerveza es muy buena si juegas contra una de esas IAs imbatibles. La echas en su cpu y ganas
All i can see is her chin lol
Good work!
Those two are so cute playing together
i want to see the final
"he didn't castle his King, so he is like a 2400 thinking he is good, too good to protect this or need to protect his KIng"
3200 ???
"Hi Anna, of course, we would love to see the next round. Love your videos, please keep it going :-)"
Im guessing Toms rating is 16-1700
Never try to be too smart. Always castle.
She rated him later after the chess
"Damn it, I would not be able to beat her,"
Next round match please
Why does this videos hook me so much when I dont even understand chess
You didn't tell us Tom's rating.
what was his rating
Not exactly a spectator sport.
"Such an oddly aggressive tittle. Dude didn't seem overconfident. This video really makes him look like a kind, intelligent, talented opponent, who gave you tons of respect as an excellent chess player. That was a really lovely match and now you just look and sound petty."
Yes
"I'm terrible at chess, but that was really fun to watch!"
"He looks confident, bully and weak, You look fragile, strong, transparent like a priceless crystal. You took all the risks, like a warrior... This was a victory against this negative bully energy. So proud to be on your side..."
"He was one pint up, Anna hadn't had any drink :) Nice game."
Love learning chess. Watching her is awesome
This guy was totally flirting with you throughout the whole match
yes
S vad hade han i rating? :)
Anna rules
"""Overconfident Guy Thinks He Can Beat Me in Chess."" Should be titled ""Anna meet a chess boyfriend"""
Tom shaking those pieces a little hard...subconsciously?
"Never played chess before, but Id fall in love with learning the game if a gorgeous girl like that taught me."
"A game with a view, he may have had another reason for dragging the game out."
I guess if his rating is about 1800
Someone please tell me how going queen G3 ends the game? Couldn't he just take the queen with his king?
Why wouldnt they just switch seats instead of resetting the pieces in the beginning? CHECKMATE BITCHES!
How can you stand to be so adorable and so smart? It seems it would be overwhelming. Like the smart side of your brain would constantly be trying to smother the adorable side of your brain. But the cuteness is strong in you. It will not yield to The Dark Side.
Lovely camera angle... because you have a great view of the chess board of course. I sweat there's a chess board if you look hard enougth!
He underestimated her.
You are both overly-confident but that is chess. He seemed around 1500 to me. He knew some openings and had mediocre tactics but when he got down material he tried to run out the clock. I am a similar type of impulsive dummy...
You cruel woman you!
"Sounds and looks like an arrogant prick... what ""great guy""? smh..."
I have ZERO clue what's going on just like her videos
"Whoa! Watching this game was AMAZING!! You just made me become super interested in chess!! That was so fun and intense to watch!! I don't know much about how the game is played but you putting up the board and explaining what's going on makes it so much easier to follow along with!! Thank you for doing that! I also watched your other videos of your GrandMaster mom that played in NY! That's how i got here to this video You're very smart and talented, may God Bless you and your family along your journey!"
The chess mind is amazing to me.. Anna looks like a movie star or a combination of famous actresses. Maybe its Queen Gambit that comes to mind
"Look at you two, having so much fun."
YOU GO GIRL
I love your chess videos! Youre an excellent narrator and a terrific player. Adorable as well
"""overconfident"" man you're one of THE most annoying ones out there gurl stfu"
Humble people like you I can do without. Asshat.
'My bast chass'.
"""This was Tom"", Did you kill him because he thought he'd beat you at Chess?"
1300
Tom is not a great guy.
Tom seems to have narcissitic traits.
Look at those creepy pervs standing watching.
"Too busy talking and sipping his douchey craft beer, laughable. Is he English? Wouldn't be surprised."
"She's very good at breast. I mean chest. No, I mean chess. Very good at this game."
Ima be honest folks. Idk why Im here. I have never been good at chess nor do I hardly play it yet I find it fascinating that they can play with such fast thinking at times that I keep coming back. Makes me see the fun in the game I guess. Good content
"Id be like ""I dont know how to play chess that well, just wanted to get your number."" Well worth the humiliating defeat."
"I dont play chess, chess all good chess players have ego, they all think they are smarter when they win. Dumb people."
"Tom looks incredibly strong. I don't know what his rating could be. Congratulations, great game."
Orange lady is distracting.
He was trying to flirt until he relisted ...
Poor boy
aaaaannnnd that's the reason why casinos GIVE AWAY alcohol for FREE!!! It lowers your inhibition and will make you do things you normally wouldn't do like aggressive betting...
"I'm not very good at chess but at 13:00 can't white queen take e6 pawn check, then take e4 pawn with bishop?"
"You said to comment here what I think his rating is but I don't know like anything about chess, however I do like to follow instructions So I'm gonna guess he's like 8/10"
Marry me ! Anna
Why not move the castle to threten the queen while its protected by the bishop? Time index 9:44
Rating? 1650 to 1800
Great game
Thanks so much for giving us your thoughts as you were playing. Learning a lot from you.
"I can't play chess, but I can feel its magic, which is very intimidating to me. I have absolutely no idea what is happening on the board, yet I love watching people play chess! It's like a profound conversation between two minds without words... a miraculous exchange occurring on another level between two beings."
Dude from the next round looks cute.....Holdawn...
"Unsufferable entitled mand says ""you will suffer"". This is a game. It has its rules. It is not allowed to intimidate or trying to degrade anybody."
That pretty girl grift...
Tom's rating looks like a ... 1900?
"he shouldve resigned a million years ago, what a tool. his rating < 1800"
We need more clubs like this around the UK. Not that im any good anymore. Somewhere along the way I lost the ability to be patient andI stopped thinking moves through.
"Im gonna guess hes 1700+, only bc you asked :)"
"Hej Anna, well done, you nailed it!"
Her titles are all the same...she needs to find a new gimmick...
"80%, but obviously Anna Cramling is in the 81st percentile"
"Tom seems like a solid 1250 to me. Kind of like myself. Plays regularly, knows some basic openings, consumed some chess content, maybe analyzes some of his games and is good enough to beat most casual players, but has a FT job etc. and hasn't read a full chess book or deeply study notation/famous games etc. And if he's really like me he plays more 5 min blitz games than he should."
You are the prettiest chess woman Ive seen so far.
"This video! For the first time in my life, chess looked interesting. I always tried to make myself play chess because it seems like a good brain exercise, but it has always felt so boring or complicated or futile."
She won because he was too distracted by cleavage.
chauvinist in chess. who can believe it.
"Don't worry about the beer spilling, we do it all the time. **it happens lol"
being nice and losing gracefully = overconfident?
You obviously like each other! I hope you stayed in touch.
U are pretty good
great overconfident girl wins haha!
SUPER
Even i can defeat him....he missed so many opportunities i think he was drunk..... First lesson don't laugh when u r in war.... His rating may be 500 or 700
Enjoyed ever second of it
I don't often see a nice way of destruction but the Bishop sacrifice on f3 was so juicy and would have crushed his kings defenses. Very nice game. While Tom was very talky in the beginning he became quiter and quiter. Nicely done. My guess is Tom is rated around 2000 elo
2200
"""Was it worth it to not castle?"" LMFAO, LET HER COOK"
Spring romance! You look cutie together ;-)
Smiling assassin
Is Tom about 1700?
What a toxic girl and so many adoring Simps in the comments.
GG
"He seems like about a 1300, players below 1500 are usually wreckless like this."
No. He is not a great guy at all!
I wouldnt be able to concentrate with all that cleavage
"Intelligence, beauty and charm..."
"Well both were not playing to their best I believe cz in any serious competition there would be nothing but silence and the focus would be on the game not banter, imho both played that particular game badly and both blundered anyway was fun watching"
Looks like you too could also have a great night together afterwards. Great fit :)
"I'm into purple shirts on a male too LOL You are killin' it, lady!!!"
1200
Are all chess players as arrogant as both people on this video? Gross.
Always go in knowing it's a game. You lose? So what? Don't think of it as a loss. Think of it as being shown where you need to improve. Someone out thought you? It's bound to happen. Learn from it and go again.
He let you win. Your beautiful snd he wanted s second date
Awesome game
Anyone seen Queen's gambit?
"hes smiling and laughing because hes drunk lol. congrats, you beat an cognitively impaired opponent lol"
Very nice game
Thank you for another really fun game to watch. You both were adorable. The end was thrilling. Way to keep it together under pressure.
So Dominic Thiem plays chess nowadays!
"I guess I would be happy to eat and live on my own, does chess pay that well? I might consider learning it if I can make money at it."
Tom- Fide 1890 ? longchess
if you were an ugly white guy you would have literally zero followers. loved the vid
How the fuck does anybody play chess while sipping on beer.
i guess he is around 1800 Elo. u around 2400?
This poor guy was actually super nervous
He never castles? That seems unwise.
About 1500
"Wow, you kick @55"
Grandeeee
Tom had one too many.
lol. anna with a pint.
Men like to be such confident ... dumb dumbs
Why did they destroy the board setup rather than just rotating the board?
"Yeah, she won. Cant wait to see the next one."
Love this video
"I'm a film professional (17 years.) This content is pure gold. The commentary, the music selections... Wow! That was fantastic. Great game, Cramling!"
1900?
I think the caption is wrong - the guy is super lovely. No overconfidence that I could detect
u wanted some of that d i could tell from the start
"Im really not very good at chess but Id guess hes 1900?? I like your play by play analysis, its neat to hear about the thoughts behind your moves."
Awesome Win!
Toms really wanted to ask you on a date
"Ew, something about him just rubs me the wrong way"
This Tom is doing Sportsmanship. Works on most people. Well done!!
"Anna i love your videos, but i've begun to notice that those titles bring the horrid sexists and bigots out of the woodwork... The kind that think you can't be sexist to men, which is just as bad as thinking you can't be racist to white ppl. It's very sad to see"
"I really loved the explanation, makes me eager to start myself"
I totally would lose on time.
"Now that's the spirit of chess, having fun while playing very well."
My young daughter came over to see what I was watching and was absolutely captivated by your video. You may have some competition on your hands in a few years!
"Yea, having a great time... really fun.... as long as your winning."
"Fine chess encounter with, let's say, this 2300 opponent (?). And very real chess talented play by Black ! Nb6 is much more effective than some Nf6. Thank-you for the performance ""tout en finesse""."
i dont know much about chess but for some reason i enjoy your videos
"as a Swede, the name ""Cramling"" seems familiar to me! is she the daughter of the famous and legendary Swedish female Chess player Pia Cramling??"
"he made a massive blunder, not a game to write home about you twot"
I play Go and I like watching Anna.
"A drunk person vs a sobber one. I don' say that the result would have been other in an other case, just noting."
"I dont know if Either of you are single. But it would have been kind of a ""G"" move if he proposed at the CM"
"I love your commentaries, you make me smile as you play!"
Another overconfident white cis male? Oh wow I'm so shocked
Qc5 Rc8 Qxa5?
"I played my first chess game last year, for the first time in over 50 years. So I'm no enthusiast, but thanks for a very enjoyable video!"
"I am not interested in chess, but for some reason yt algorithm suggested it. I watched it fully, have a great time. Nice analysis, good mood, interesting game. Thanks!"
"I remember a couple of years back playing Yahoo chess online... and cheating with the Chessmaster program up and running. The guy complemented me that with a few more practice, I'll be at the Grand Master level..."
"First game l have ever watched. I had no idea what was happening, but it was fun, 73, RN Utah"
"Tom is 1850, max, but played like he was 1600 because he underestimated you."
Misleading title. He seemed like a nice guy.
the reason he feels overconfident is because girls are generally bad at strategic games like chess
gender war drone ....... yawn
"i dont understand chess AT ALL. AT ALL. I dont think im capable of learning. I really respect people who can play; i tend to consider them intelligent. Kudos. This is a foreign language to me. Like, dead language foreign"
"He lost as soon as he sat down. Your energy is so positively captivating that it is extremely alluring. By the time he realize how good you were and you were playing to win, it was too late for him. I don't know how to play chess and wish I knew how but you make me want to learn. I do enjoy your videos."
could it be that he was distracted (albeit sublimally) by his exceedingly lovely opponent.
Such a funny beer game it is! :)
"I think chest is revealed too much, so game is much harder..."
nice tits
Yes! Let's see the next round :)
I used to think I was good at chess until I played someone who was good at chess
"Can Sweden please, please, please stop punishing the world (for whatever reason) with Gretas."
Extremely annoying. The TikTok version of agent provocateur. Everything for money and fame.
"So, this hustler has stopped calling everyone ""hustler?"" Look, Ma, she learned a couple of new words (one even long): ""overconfident"" and ""guy."" By the age of 80, she will know maybe even 100 words. Even hustlers can learn."
"""I love that purple shirt"" Oof... That was mean Anna"
I would love to lose to You
"""Overconfident"" is when girl, which plays chess thinks she is smart."
Butchery .. :)
All annoying
What was his rating?
Overconfident people are always the easiest to beat at chess
Interesting game
Ive never given much thought to chess as anything but a simple board game. This was wild and I have so much more respect for chess now
Ann destroyed him!
Surely anyone who plays chess knows the Botez sisters who were the original pretty girl hustlers. If I saw someone like her I would just assume she was going to school me.
"It's impossible to watch anything in 2024 that involves a man and a woman without the gender war drones jumping on it For the normal people though, looked like a nice friendly game."
"Why is this young woman not in the world ranking if she can beat "" anybody "" And I have seen her for months any person must know by now she is not easy to beat ,but all seem surprised ,This is a gag ?"
We never found out his rating.
Great game! You are a very educated & smart person!
"if he just played solidly instead of doing risky business he would have won lol, 3 minutes up on time."
"I can't figure out why he didn't take your knight with his black bishop, and I still can't figure out why you went after his white bishop with your pawn."
"after f3, I thought you would sac Bishop on f3 and get your R in"
"He was trying to make it seem to others around him and even convince himself that he was essentiallly helping or teaching or guiding her. Not wanting to lose his 80% winrate to a woman, without there being an excuse for it."
I don't want the next round lol
"Maybe high rating, but if she dindnt know who he was playing against maybe should take some more lectures"
Reminds me of the polish girls Eurovision entry video!
One of the few women I saw and I regrettet to be gay.
"He was a goof most of the game, aggressive and stupid. Had his queen far out in front and vulnerable. Beginners moves."
Man-splaining! What a doofus!
You are totally in love...
"The brain rot in these comments is insane. Stop turning a friendly game of chess into something its not, they both had fun and everyone had a good time. Nobody felt offended its so weird that people in the comments feel the need to be offended for others."
Every place and every sport girls are getting advantage because they are girls. Unfair for men
"A single hetero male, if you were a single and hetero female, would care less about the chess, more about the game. Edit: Nu vet jag att du r svensk. Hur 17 kom du till? Dina frldrar eller ngonting annat? (Utan att ha en aning om vem du r, helt rligt, googlade ditt namn fr att du r en s intelligent och och extremt st tjej och fick upp ""Spansk-svensk"" men har faktiskt inte lst mer. Inser att du beter dig vldigt svenskt. Hur som, jag nskar jag vore intelligent och utseendemssigt nra din liga. Det r jag inte. Men du ska vara stolt ver dig sjlv och du kommer frhoppningsvis inspirera tjejer att klara sig sjlva utan en rik man eller handikapp i livet.)"
"He is not THAT good, that's why he has to use mind games."
tom probably 1900
Fun game fun commentary nice video thanks!
"I'm here for the very first time. I loved everything about the video but the title. Yes he made a couple of funny, a bit borderline strong comments but that's part and parcel of the game. I don't necessarily think it is right to call him the ""overconfident guy"". He was even humble in defeat :)"
I think your smile messed with his brain.
"Anna you remind me of my daughter Annah!! She's smart like you but never liked the game of chess, so when I study your end game, and see all the logic I think of her, in calling out that guy Tom's bluffs, in his attempts to mislead you in his guest of your submission, but he underestimated your skill I'm sure, and its why he blundered is my guess."
I was really interested in your thought processes during the game. Thank you for taking the time to add them.
17:05 why did he move the king if he was trying to run out your clock?
Of course we want to see you win a bottle of wine!
"Jeez, how do 1.3k people give this a thumbs down? It's a game of chess lol"
Colin Jost plays chess?
"He seems like a great guy, and you're awesome. Without knowing each of your circumstances, you two could make such an awesome couple."
What is Tom's rating?
well done
"Tom was attempting to manipulate Anna by giving advice. Just play, dude."
Snyggt spelat!
Bro was humbled
"Please, what is a music in a background calls? 2:15"
"Beer & chess, what a great setting :) Goodgame!"
I love smart women hi ()
"I don't understand people who talk too much during chess matches.... Man, shut up and play!"
Drunk guy thinks he can beat me at chess
This is like watching the last two minutes of a football game (American) when there are seconds on the clock but the players make them count.
nicely done
nice match I like how you have the chess displace up on the screen it help follow were the chess pieces are
"Insane how mind games are mind games unless it is a man to a woman, then it is gender pressure."
is this an AI Voiceover?
I'm guessing the woman wins.
I don't know how to play chess but I watched anyway. Complex game it seems.
I can't believe how much I enjoyed this. I watch too much YouTube as it is. so thanks a whole lot. Great game by the way.
He underestimated you
semifinals game please bc the guy is hot
I ship them
I never thought I'd say this about chess but that was exciting!
Interesting British accent
He talks too much.
First class commentary
Looks like a couple of hotties... nothing more than fair mind games... looking into it more is pandering...
Well done
Y'all should obviously get married
I think his rating is about 1200? Idk hes not great at planning so probably lower. Nice guy tho!
Why are you talking about the guy in past tense? Did you smack him with the board off camera
oh my god just switch seats and start of redoing the whole setup
he was flirting with you the whole time did not care about his game
"Poor video title - made it sound like Tom was going to be one of those macho morons who think they can beat all females, whereas he was simply a great player who lost gracefully."
don't know about Tom but you are a 10
"I think his rating is about 1900 USA, or 1800 ELO"
Not drinking is definitely an asset.
"Not sure he was overconfident, he just lost. You can win sometimes when you're not confident, and you can smile without being smug. Plus he admitted his position was not great. So, where was he overconfident"
I've never seen a women play blind folded yet by their discourse here you would think they are equals. just funny how they pose.
Isn't shaked -> shook?
Annas addicted to the time crunch
16:52 I beg your pardon
This porn movie sucked... I was expecting them to make crazy love on the chess board at the end! :(
"Congratulations for among 20 percent of people there, which is not an easy task."
Tom looks like your brother. Is he?
I don't know how this popped up?but I like chess I don't get to play it very often I'm not good at it but I enjoy playing and I like to see Good sports and Tom was a very good sport I have no idea what his or your ratings are but you guys are very good and this was interesting
Tom is definitely a 5 star Uber driver. He has a good personality.
What is this channel? Self-affirming feminist narcissism via chess matches?
lmao... Every video I watch with this girl she always seems so oblivious to what everyone else around her may be thinking.
"British men always wear purple. Well played, I'm so happy you beat him."
Why not just turn the board around?
hes not smart
"You crushed him , but he was smitten with you , all his blood was in his tiny head . You are dangerous"
1100 toms rating
"I have no idea how chess works, but i really enjoyed watching this video and your explanation"
"Great video, I love the laughing, that made my day"
and then they fucked
He is cute though. Haha.
You ROCK Anna ! Thank you for sharing your game with us !
Omg. She is already a multi millionaire at 23 making street chess videos! She is one of the greatest HypeMaster!
Anna might have distracted think how good at chess their children would be.
Why not putting the beer on the left side? You should drink beer with your left anyways ;)
"As someone who doesn't play or know the rules of chess, I just came here to see a girl beat up an overconfident guy in a game. I was not disappointed."
girlboss
"Anna, ""anyways"" is no a word, the correct form is ""anyway."""
this guy has one thousand percent roofied girls before
I think he was about 1600 ECF.
"Have no idea what his rating is, but I'm sure it's high. Fun tournament!"
May be the beer is to blame!
chess and alcohol doesn't sound like a very good winning strategy.
tom is a hottie
I think this was not your first beer in this evening.
"Despite all his nervous laughing, he knew he was up against a FAR better player who was not going to intimidated !!! Anna WON and quite rightly so !!! BRAVO Anna !!!"
Was it worth it not to castle? :)
"Ok Youtube, I watched it. Stop recommending it now, please?"
I really appreciate the voiceover and animations / explanations of the possibles moves. Made me appreciate chess a whole lot more.
He wouldn't have predicted your moves out loud at the start if you were a guy. He is a sexist idiot.
I have never had the attention span for chess...yet these videos make it an engaging game for even a casual viewer like me! Well done.
"His rating is 1, beginner."
Nothing sweeter than the privilege of watching a beautiful victory at the hands of a beautiful girl in a beautiful game. Well done.
"Seeing him fake smile so much pumped with that ego..omg so annoying and ego complex. That's the kind of shit that use chess as an ego trip. Loved to see him decimated. I wouldn't make him more than 1850 max 1900. Very nice explanations on the moves. Good job not taking the bait and winning on time. It wasn't very technical after all as he majorly fucked up with that knight soon enough. He thought he was hunting a frightened deer, but it was a wolf. Hahahah. Nice. I'm subscribing."
interesting
Such a great job in sharing the game.. I was a Chess Coach in a Prep. I only had 3 young women in 4 teams but they sure loved the game.. Thank you again. Around 990
Of course we want to see it.
I was smiling wishing she would show more of those petite ( . )( . )
Anna your a beautiful... BEAST!!! Lol.. More importantly you have a beautiful soul !!
near the end you shouldve a to e the rook on the back rank lining up queen and then sacrificed the bishop to end it super quick
"don't know why this was on my recommended, as I'm not really a chess fan. still a fun watch, though I dislike the title - the opponent seemed to be a genuinely nice guy wanting a good match, I don't see the overconfidence (or thusly implied bragging, arrogance etc), only the insult to a decent person playing at a local tournament by the poster themselves."
This was Tom? He dead now?
Tom was mesmerized by the smiling assassin sitting across the table. Almost impossible to concentrate if Anna was smiling and flashing those eyes at you.
"12:20 Crucial moment. From this moment on, you took a decisive advantage. Beautiful and smart. Best regards from Mexico."
It's always entertaining watching nerds.
sweet
did she say ''ce soir''??? 17:57
"Speed-chess-dating, nice!"
Great )))
"I don't have that much sympathy for him, since he was mansplanning half of your moves ""that's a good move"", ""you could do this""... I would hate if someone did that to me without asking. Beautiful game tho"
Shes the real life Queen Gambit!
"I have no idea, he seems like a random jerk from a bar, but since he was playing with you almost on equal footing (or at least, it looked like it for a while), I assume he was far higher than I initially thought."
My heart had no business beating that fast!
Beatiful game - congratulation for staying cool and playing your game
"your accent is weird it kinda sounds american, but its also obvious that youre not."
I agree he should have taken the knight when he had chance.
"15:00 - ""I don 't know why I was laughing and smiling"" - beer has that effect. ;)"
WHAT A BOSS!!!! 16 seconds?!?!!? GREAT GAME! <3 <3 <3 Good for you girl!
This was fairly click-baity. What a shock.
"Great game! This is my first time seeing a video from you, Anna. Love how you kept your cool and stayed true to your ideas. <3 Chess is a game of the mind, after all. How you chat with your opponent, even in a friendly match, and their reaction, can help you secure a win, so I don't blame him at all for trying that technique of planting certain moves in your head or alluding to his plans! Use the tools you got, I say. He's handsome and charming and I think it's natural for him, not malicious or fake. Why not use that charisma in competition? lol plus, laughter is a great way to diffuse nervous energy."
"what a goose , lost advantage thru not checking at least 5 times ,"
"I'd say Tom is rated about 1600. Or, at least, he should be."
'I had to play my best chest'
Good job girl !!!
1900
Tom underestimated you from the beginning.
He was intimidated by your presence and your skill level. Just part of life he will have to learn how to handle.
He was thinking about something but it wasn't chess.
"MY FRIEND BEAT ANNA 3 MONTHS ago in under 20 moves. But of course, Anna didn't post her crazy loss."
Great match
Why is he always touching his nose and then the pieces?!
I think he likes her...
I your so smart.. for a woman
Well done.
You had fun playing! :) And it was in vain that your opponent did not castle. :)
"I didn't watch the end of the video but the term ""overconfident"" sort of hints that he couldn't beat you!!!"
1650
"No one has commented to your question - whether we want to see your next game in the semi-finals. Maybe those to the point comments are WAY BACK in the first one hundred! I'm commented here weeks later and with 2,039 comments!!"
I don't think we was overconfident but was trying to flirt with you.
Typically men are better at chess but not always.
Congratulations
good video
That is what my sister-in-law said to me last night you have only 21 seconds left.
My guess for Tom's rating was 1900 before i looked at comments. But i guess he's probably a bit higher
Love the fact that you can be ultra-competitive but polite and smiling at the same time. Hurray for both of you!
That purple shirt is hideous.
Great fun to watch as well
"""I'm playing Tom a frequent champion of this tournament"" ""Overconfident guy thinks..."". How is that ""overconfident""? It's clearly well-earned confidence. Why demonize him for being skilled and sure of his abilities?"
I know nothing about chess but I find it interesting. But I think Anna has to be one of the most pleasant people ever. I would find it hard to concentrate playing her.
"That needs a reply. I cannot see any overconfidence in him! And he was talkative, as you explained that he is one of the best players in this club - he was probably initially in some coaching mode. And later he laught because he did not expect the apparent flow of the game. Choosing such a title for this video simply throws bad light on yourself. Also, maybe wear a bit more closed clothes - he also was not opening his shirt. That's just unneeded!"
What a delightful young woman!
Every player drinking beers ? Does it help for reflection ?
Creative game!
"I don`t play chess. Why am I watching this, although I have no clue what`s going on? I just wanted you to win, Anna! And you did it!!! (Yeah, ) Clever girl! You are amazing!"
"What a girl! ""Vikings always fighting"""
Bravissima!
i was on the edge of my seat!
It gives Dont flatter yourself. You were never even a player.
omg u played tom!! i have beaten tom before (he went to my uni)
"So, did he offer to take you out for dinner?"
"der hat vorher 80% der Leute umgehauen, weil er sie totgequatscht hat. Geht mit charming Anna nicht, das maht sie schon selbe3r. Spiels du am Nebntisch, hast du ein Stadiongefhl."
Uuuu... Anna is very charming.
"You play ""chass"". Actually you played your ""bast chass"""
0:40 you have chessboards sticked to tables?
"Was he overconfident or over British-friendly, to which you may not be used to?"
Anna Cramling is gorgeous. Her attractiveness distracts male players.
If ya gotta lose...best to lose against a sweet honey with marvelous chesticles!
"I don't know chess. But I do know a little about body language etc. This game reminded me of say, a James Bond movie where everyone is smiling while playing a game, but they all had guns pointing at each other under the table. Interesting he went in hard from the start. He's thought he could intimidate you and backed that up with little things he said along the way. I'm glad you stayed focused."
Tom ... at least 1200 maybe 1500
Rating is 700 talking 2800
1900?
Brains & Beauty!!
"What happens if he at 14:51 moves the white king to E1. With that move he defends the white rock on the D against the black queen, and if the black pawn goes to d2 the white rock could take the the black pawn without being afraid of the black queen."
Sweet! Not that my analysis means much since either of you would completely kick my butt.
"Your opponent wasn't overconfident. It was the mental game that he played with you. Thankfully, you didn't play his game. Brillant match. Bravo."
I am better.
"I used to play chess, can't understand what you're talking about but great narrative"
In the early game I felt you weren't aggressive enough. Always good to take control of the centre of the board early on. Well played in the end though.
"i just want to say, it's not cool that you are trying to make it look like he was being bigoted to you. It's not cool and it doesn't fly. get a grip and get over yourself and get a real fucking job. its honestly really sick that you would sink to this level instead of just going and getting a regular fucking job. you dont need views that badly. stop slandering people's names. and stop trying to make men look bad when you're the one who's actually a bigot."
very well played !!! way to go to rein in male overconfidence !!
"14:17 You said it twice, FYI. >;)"
I was watching this like my dad watches soccer and I know nothing about both
"I think he is a solid player, but his main strategy is to play with his opponents mids by telling them about the moves... but you didn't take the bait."
What's 'chawk mate'?
"Anna played an almost a perfect game! And at the middle of the game, Tom started to smile differently because he realized that his overconfidence is not working against Anna!"
"Tom lost because of .... cleavage!! Smart ..... move (pun intended) I have a stereotypical view of chess, so I was surprised by seeing so many women playing chess, the girl next to her also won her game, and that tom was kind of not ugly."
"When guys feel threatened by a woman, they start giving her advice or complimenting her on what she's doing to make themselves seem like the more competent ones in the situation. It's a common tactic meant to shoot down a woman's confidence. Of course it rarely works, and ends up just being really irritating."
Its wonderful ! We want the semi final !
Nicely played & beer too!
"I would give him 1700 ELO maybe. Both of you did mistakes. And there was a forced mate with a sacrifice of the rook near the end when Anna was looking for one, but missed it. It's funny how he desperatly tried to open his rook to Anna's king, but Anna refused everytime, which was the correct answer."
Women winning!
@2:36 - He's just staring at your boobs. A good enough strategy...
lovely
"I think Tom may have been smiling cause you're a hot blonde girl, but, I think that might have been a bit too obvious lol"
You are amazing.
new friend like and don
gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
nice video
"He saved the check-mate, but some check-mates cannot be saved! Great commentary and great game!"
"great job. but no: you did not drink one ounce of beer, while he drank the whole pint; and your title worked, i watched; but how was he overconfidant?"
"14:45 ""I don't know why we were laughing and smiling so much."" I do. : )"
interesting foreplay....
how does he keep his eyes on the board?
good job
How the fun did she new from the beginning shes gonna win?
you guys were smiling while your soldiers got massacred.
Oh yeah
"No, I don't want to see the semifinals. J/k. Of course we do."
"Boobs hanging out, trying to distract him. Good strategy!"
"I don't know much about chess, but it seems like his game is primarily to confuse his opponents with random-ish moves to force them to think more, taking time off the clock, putting pressure on them in the end game. That's what I got out of this."
He may have done a little better if there was any chance for him to think straight
I'd obliterate her in a Total War battle simulation. Chess is just memorizing mathematical possibilities. I would only play random chess.
she a completely self absorbed narcissist. I think she's an effing A-hole!
Arrogant !
"Tom is trying to get with you, that's what's going on."
"I'd rather compliment you for making chess really exciting. ""If you've made it this far"" has not been dificult. Thank you for your video"
There's no way Jake Paul can take getting hit 20 times a round.. he has no idea how strong Mike Tyson is
Maybe they will get married??
"I don't like how the titles are ""[male] was a jerk"" clickbait, when it's almost never justified. Clickbait is fraud."
"so, what was Toms rating?"
"Sorry, tom is not a great guy, hes a b!t of a d!@#..."
Where's the part where he's an overconfident guy?
"Tom made so many mistakes, being a chest player since I was 4 never seen serious chest players laughing like kids but enjoy your life we only go around once .."
The fun fact is she is way less interesting for her skills in chess than her boobs. Hide your face and tits and 98% of your audience will be gone immeditely
"Jaw,"
dating show or chess game
I bet he can punch your face in.
crushing victory!
"Yes ,,, show us everything :)))"
1500
Well dome
"You made a ton of mistakes. The match could have been ending with you out of time or without queen with some early move of the rook. That guy played better, big mistake at the end with the bishop."
Okay weird kudos for not repeating phrases in the video. I do the same thing.
The secret to winning at chess is cleavage.
Did they checkmate later? I mean come on pretty obvious he was into her
2200
"Ahhhh yes.... reminds me of when I used to play club/league chess back in London a loooong time ago. We had a few members that used the Cleavage Defense. One of our main rivals was Richmond Juniors. Hard to concentrate when you're 12 or 13 and facing the Cleavage Defense... 2:19... the main, main, main line"
toms rating is more than mine thats for sure
Its hard to know his rating on just one game I think. But maybe a rating of 1900 or 2000? Lets say 1950. He is better than me
So when did you two go on a date?
That was Fabulous Anna! And what a superb commentary. Yes please film the next matches!
NEXT TIME AS FOR A HALF PINT
You go girl!
If girls legitimately could beat guysthere wouldnt be a mens and womens tournament.
Flagging is winning on time?
i would say literally No girls could play chess and if they did they would loose anyway!
"I have never watched anyone play chess before, but I found this very entertaining."
"I am 60 but I remember the concentration in playing chess even young to plan at least 3 steps in advance , such a great game i would love to play a game in this type of environment"
This guy is gay!
BOTH OF U MADE TONS of mistakes i rate both u at 4 out of 10
"I am horrible at chess, just ask my kids, though I love the strategy. Well done, and awesome sportsmanship"
"I love the board they're using - anyone have any idea where I can get one like this, or similar?"
Cocky young lady!
loved this!!! great game
loved it
I think Tom should put more lemonade in his drink.
kg4
I think Tom is a great player but he was overly confident against a beautiful young lady. I am curious to see a best out of 3 game.
"Once you get to a certain level with your game, Chess becomes part of you. I'm 68 and have been playing since my teens. I am NOT great but sometimes Good is Enough !!! Loved your game and the friendly banter between you and your opponent !!"
wonderful game
They show the ugly normal looking chess players for like 2 seconds and then they focus on the attractive ones
"Where overconfidence ? He just sounds like a cheap-ass mind-player, trying to lead the game by using suggestion. Every chess player does that at one point. He's just smiling and talks a lot because of beer. Really nice played though, I learned a lot about positions thanks to your plays."
The more he sees his weakness the more he try to confuse you. I don't know if it is normal but it is for sure dishonest. What a slicker.
I felt s -ly excited by listening to this voice . You can't play chess against such a beautiful opponent
"i dont know a thing about chess, had to pause and google what some terms meant, but i just wanna say how cool it is to see a woman taking up space in the chess world and being an overall stellar person and player will be watching more of your videos queen"
I recommend uploading 2 versions of this; 1 with your commentary and 1 without so we can hear the conversations. Great video nonetheless.
Chozz.
I have never plYed chess but this is fascinating. I love how you are chipping his over inflated ego.
"I couldn't concentrate with that beautiful face so close,I'd just want to kiss her"
I don't play chess so this whole video might as well been in a foreign language. Lol Nice win tho!
"My dog, that horrible man was soooooooooooooooo arrogant, he kept smiling because he thought he could beat a 'mere' woman. So glad you wiped his a**."
Love?
1900
"Tournament, not turnament."
"Yes, I want to see the semi's."
"Tom played this game as 2000 rating player...He had no ""positional plan"", but what the great Botvinnik would call simple ""naskoki"""
"'Tom' strikes me as a bit of an arrogant prick, hiding behind a smile and a laugh."
Tom wanted you to win to get that number. Its so obvious.
Toms rating: Dick
You are smart to politely sip your beer and NOT drink it all! Plus - your beauty distracts the men into flubbing up! Hahaha!
Youre my chess hero - Anna!
Seems like Tom was about 1200 ELO
Yes
Anna's played Magnus.
"Isn't amazing when sometimes PEOPLE ASSUME someone is OVERCONFIDENT, when It's actually just CONFIDENT. Then again, I would have titled this Overconfident PLAYER thinks they can beat me in Chess. But I am a normal human being. And do not ACCUSE the opposite sex of something, JUST because they are alive and breathing. I guess, that's just me. Your ignorance is embarrassing, to BOTH sexes."
Does anyone in the chess world really NOT know who Anna is?
"he doing what many men does in front of a woman, mansplanning, it s a tipical inconscious thing that makes men thinking they have to teach girls, thinking they might not know what s happening, what to do, how to do ... sometime it s cute because the guy is just shy and want to show the girl his knownledge so she thinks he s smart, but sometime it s just ridiculous, like in computer science, if you are a girl, how many guys will teach you things that you learned even before they were born lol"
"To answer your question: I was originally going to say about 1800, but I'm thinking he's approaching 2000. But not there yet. The real question is was he killed by overconfidence only, or also by distraction (we all have off days). Okay, I've talked myself out of 2000. I'm going to stab at 1840. Hopefully you will reveal at the end."
Might have been best if you had told him to keep quiet.
Anna is so hot.
Well played. You stumped him good.
Great game - loved the tactics.
Tom was chess champion at his school?
Geez Anna :) We can hear him :) you don't have to say everything he is saying right after he has spoken it <3
"Next round please, enjoyed watching that so much and its the first game i have watched in ages, made me laugh too."
nice!
That was more than just a friendly game of chess
Being down a piece was the end for him
"Looks like cheating of you, because of what you wear....lol"
What a great game. Good job
With 16 seconds left.Sweet
"Great Game my sons and I, watch you games from Guam USA in the Western Pacific (the other Hawaii) where Americas Day truly begins . Love your games and videos."
You go girl!
Care meter all time low. Who cares!
"14:10 - my next move would have been knight to A4, not queen to C2"
"You didn't ""shaked"" hands, you ""shook"" hands. lol. Sorry, couldn't help it, but you were in England... lol."
do less vpiceover
I love it when guys underestimate women. Please show the follow-up.
women winning? yes
"You know he wouldn't be giving his opinion like that, ""that's the best move you could make,"" if you were a dude."
Cleavage Wins? Great psyops.
I don't understand how he let you put a camera there and film that.
He was over confident but you were the better player. I like how you went unconventional because it always confuses players like Tom. I use it all the time. Great win!
"THIS is how cute singles should meet up. Challenging each other whilst having fun. They probably both are not single, but still. Look at them. Oh, this channel is about chess? Sorry, got distracted by their cuteness."
"I love Anna -- win, lose or draw she'll always be my hero"
"You didn't win, he was just distracted from the nice view ^^."
You should wear a medium sized necklace with a good sized sparkly bobble !!!
Good luck young LAdy!
he underestimated you! and you prevailed
This guy reminds me of larry bird telling his opponents his moves .
Great Fun to watch. I am so pleased you beat Tom - the tricky nice guy who took his loss like a gentleman.i look forward to your next posting.
Why didn't he take the knight with his queen around 14:00?
"Make no mistake, chess is war - always."
Wow I havent seen that much smiling and giggling since high school yall are adorable.
1900?
"So, what was his rating? Someone who never castles will probably not get past 1800-ish, right? Also, his game plan was very obvious for anyone over 1800. Black was in total control at all times."
"I already did check them out. Oh, you mean the London Knight Club."
I know nothing about chess. This is awesome!
next round please.
"You opened with ""Queen's Cleavage"" and still lost."
1600
I'm definitely getting a purple shirt
"If Anna wasn't hot enough already, I find that she drinks good beer !"
"Anna has a superpower, she distracts the guys with her beauty!!"
"Let's see the continuation of this !! And, well done against the purple knight."
"17:40 She says, with 1-3 purple shirts visible in the background. Great game, it looked like a lot of fun!"
Your calm as the seconds tick down is the stuff of legend.
i think he is about 1700.
Beat me AT chess!
I really enjoyed how you narrated and went through strategies and what you were thinking
"I don't know what a rating is, sorta."
"I would love to play you. We have no touries or anything around here. You would beat me I'm sure, I played in college, and had fun."
Almost every dude was wearing a purple shirt.
"If he had taken your pawn E4 with his Bishop, continues with Checks things might turned up differently...."
Well done
"Anna don't leave your drink out of your vision ever please be careful, also this guy was creepy and manipulative."
"Ugh Tom explains how he let you win. Come on Tom, have some class."
Great narration Anna and well played!
Outstanding
Ivar
Drunk Play.
"Agree on purple shirt, his purple shirt looks great and they should be more popular! Purple for the win"
"With a face like that, she better be good at something other than ""house"" duties . . ."
Overconfident guys thinks he can beat me lol what a bloody misleading title
Brilliant game. Really enjoyed it. Was really scared you were going to run out of time but you did real well.
i dont know anything about chess but still watched this so engaged
"0:40 Ummm, can't you just rotate the board?"
Minding your P&Q. The bartender would remind the barmaid to mind you PINTS AND QUARTS.
He was smiling due to your tits
"He was certainly flirting with you, but by slightly exposing your sweater puppies you were hoping to distract him."
Lots of flirting over that chessboard.
I haven't played in quite some time. This was quite enjoyable. You both are good.
that was great.
Great content
COOL!!!!
1400
Great game!
"i dont know why this was recommended to me because i am way too much of a flop to play chess and have never watched chess content before. However, yall have some chemistry! I hope you got his number/insta/something!"
She kept her beer on the ground for the algorithm
Why wouldn't someome be comfident they are going to win?
Hey....Did you know: GOD OF THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE CREATED EVERYTHING ABOUT SIX THOUSAND YEARS AGO. NO SUCH THING AS EVOLUTION AND BILLIONS OF YEARS OF AGO. DINOSAURS LIVED WITH MAN. FOLLOW ASTROPHYSICIST DR JASON LISLE
Looks like Beth Harmon has a sister.
Id love to see the next round!
Hes seems like a really sweet guy.
Masterclass.
What a great way of handling a defeat.
"Anna speaks English like a native, but occasionally, there is a very subtle example of her Spanish contaminating her English (common thing for bilingual people). For example, she says ""I really recommend you going [to this night club]"". Could you hear a monolingual native English speaker say that? Sure! It is not even wrong. But the more common usage is ""I recommend that you ... + (subjunctive verb)"". In my family, anyway, all the Spanish speakers who speak English as a second language gravitate towards ""recommend you"" because in Spanish you say things like ""te lo recomendo"" or ""recomendarle"", etc. I am in awe of this YouTube blogger. She's got marvelous content, and I didn't even know she was bilingual till recently, but now that I know, I hear these little tell-tale signs of her bilingualism, and for me, it adds interest to her bio."
I'm watching for the chess ....
7:30 lol when she laughs at her own commentary
"Finally maybe hey was more interested by the girl than the bottle of wine, if he can have the both with losing..."
-hottest girl on the planet with a low cut top = tom laughing like a schoolgirl and losing
Sometimes there is such mesmerizing chemistry between opponents. Thats what I felt here. Well done!
"Fun game ton watch, thank you"
Tom plays at about 1500 to 1600 level in my humble opinion... maybe he is drunk.. :P
She made it look easy!!
"Great game, would like to see you play the rest of the tournament"
"16:54 Can you mate me in 20 seconds,,,,, boys will be boys"
She may have lost had she not shown so much cleavage lol.
amateurs :)
"Clocks for chess is stupid, a thinking game requires time and patience. Clocks were not there from the beginning and shouldn't be there now. BTW you wouldn't have spilled your beer and embarrassed yourself if the clocks were not there."
"I'm not very good at chess. I like playing it, but I rarely win a game and it's hard for me to read a board when others are playing. But you are really good at explaining the game as it progresses and to show the viewer where the action's at. A very good video for beginners."
"i like your boobs, i mean hair or your gaming?"
That was fun
He's lucky to be playing chess and not poker......
did Tom get a happy ending?
"He had an initial aggressive posturing, but developed all power pieces with no symmetry after the first 5 moves. That black solid defense, when you briefly questioned that it might have been effective, that it's use in place, you were able to first repulse, then send in the queen at the right time, which ultimately threw off OLE Tom's confidence ! Another weakness of Tom's was that he distracted himself with all of the play by play, and move scenarios! The more he talked, the more nails were getting hammered into his ""skillfully"" played game Coffin ! R I P , black !! LOL! 18:17"
You are supeer cute:)
Interesting video! I'm going to pay that Knight Club place a visit. Near Elephant Park too. So great to see you both had fun playing that game!!
Did he ask you out?
"Stop making the victim of patriarchy thumbmail ""You'll suffer"" he didn't say anything like that. He was smiling the whole time lmao"
"I am not conviced about the messages and thumbnails of Anna Cramling. She seems to like to humiliate others, as if she revenge-plays against *""evil macho men"".* Personally I wouldn't brag about a game on the web - to out someone who lost against me. Compare her channel to *""Michael Redmond's Go TV""* This humble man is a worldclass-Go-master but never ever brags or compares. I suspect that a few of her subscribers are feminists and another bunch subscribed for her looks instead of her play."
2259
1898
Yes please
told you what to do cause if he loses its not because you are good but because he helped you out....its an excuse that works with his ego either way
he's hut!
The music always makes these games feel so intense and dramatic! A battle of the ages!... for a bottle of wine lol
He was playing at a 6 and you at an 8. Great job to both of you!
Why no black people?
Players not playing chess.Players playing 3D chess
Looked like such a fun game!
I'd definitely like to see the next round. You look too be an awesome chess player.
"Yes, please ! Would love to see the continuation of this tournament. :)"
"I know nothing about chess but it's obvious a lot of people would underestimate Anna. The funny thing about that is the older you are and the more ""woke"" you are the more nervous you would be sitting down in any sort of competition with someone like her. Her smiling cheerfulness and youth are MAJOR warning signs that you're about to get stomped..."
I definitely want to see the next game
Bring it on!!
The gigolo chess player goes down in flames
You can't like mansplainers.
Well done miss
Excellent game! Won with 1 second to spare.
I love watching you play. The way people approach you like they are going to destroy you and with a smile you destroy them.
Tom is such a cute young guy. He had no idea who he was gonna be up against..lol
"13:02, he can't take the bishop, you are threatening checkmate with Qxf2#"
"i like your older videos better, without all the narration."
"that was lovely, Tom was really great, your description was amazing!"
So much mansplaining!! nicely played
hehehehe
Nice work.
2500
I like your videos but the music for this one is a bit.... odd??
next round please
I have no idea anything about chess but watched it anyway and its solidified that Ill never learn chess. Its so confusing
Your look is the second queen you have. Great game!
I believe I just watched chess flirting
"At 73, I am NOT a true PLAYER, but I know how to play at a VERY amateur level. As such, I have never played with THE CLOCK! lol What I love most about this channel is KNOWING I will have a blast watching great players FINISH a game in usually around 10 or so minutes!!! PLEASE continue bringing us these games. I am learning SO much just watching and hearing what is being said. My ONLY negative, and YES there will be some feeling the opposite, I am sure, is when watching a game, I can hear another playing pair running their mouths talking 'smack' back & forth_ very distracting for someone like me. THANK YOU MUTE BUTTON!!! lmsbo! I love this channel. Thank you for what you provide."
I have never seen her before but I absolutely love her. You do you girl!!
Nice video. God helg
I'm waiting for u to post your losses. ;)
Nice job Anna! I was as concerned as you were there for a brief minute. Was that three shades of red on Tom?
"Wow, you got him! I enjoyed every step and explanation, awesome!"
there are some moves I would have made that you did not but you are a better player than me so I just wonder what my move would have done to the game.
Where is this place? i can't find it on the map.
"You only need 1 piece at the beginning to determine what colour each person will be playing with and why not just swap sides physically, instead of swapping all the pieces and messing them up again?? Very intelligent lol"
What is she a chess wizard or something. Ive never played and dont really care.
"Cant really rate Tom on the strength of one game. What I know from experience is that people who start discussing your strategies, as if to help and during the game, are actually insecure about their chances of winning and preparing excuses ahead of time. Well, I shouldnt have made all those suggestions, and, Well, I did help you, didnt I? Its not uncommon. I would be interested to know if he said anything like that? 	Also, in fairness to Tom, there is the added pressure of you making a YouTube video, but I suppose that applies to both of you? 	Yet, in further mitigation, assuming he is as heterosexual as his body language suggested, your striking beauty must have been a major distraction. Especially in an informal setting, where alcohol is being served and you were both partaking. He would be lying if he didnt admit that was a highly distracting pressure."
"C'mon Anna, you don't know why Tom was smiling so much??? Let me put it this way.....had you been a guy, Tom wouldn't have been smiling...at all. Does that make it clear enough for you? Let's just say, losing to you isn't the worse thing in the world. As they got the pleasure of sitting across from you. You have that personality and the looks to go with it."
Sure do
this is all foreign to me..I've never played......looks hard.
The chic in the bg is also hot. Id pay a visit to this bar if I were there lol
I dont know how to rate chess players yet
Dayum Anna you are like queens gambit but in a much better way
"Anna, you know you can always ask for a 'half' pint of beer. Small glass, less damage when you pour it over the chess board."
Always castle guys.
I'd say he's a 1500
Very enjoyable!
:)
Anna Play the (Cow)
Ha! What a tease! Of course we want to see the next round!
curious why you didn't leverage your bishop to take out the pawn
So cool. I think you guys need to date. Something is there
Is this lie a dating venue?
Tom lost. Tom laughed at himself and was humble in defeat. Tom is an incredible human being. Be like Tom!
The chessboard animations and explanation is sooo good. I literaly dont know chess but I could follow because of the voice over
He should have taken your horse on b3
You are a delight. lol
Deeper cleavage would bring you the win faster
1500?
Let him think he can! It's the very least HE can do!
Is there any vids of you loosing probable not! good game.
great job! Keep itu p!!
"As a big fish in a tiny pond, I love seeing play that is above me, but still accessible. Your commentary made this a wonderful learning experience. Thank you. Well played."
These chess YTs are fake AF
"^ Imagine (theoretically) the kids that these two would create ""if"" they were married !!!!!! Impressed & really enjoyed the video, as I used to play chess with my schoolmate Adrian well into the night** Wife & kids were in bed & we were laughing our heads off, but I'm $hit at chess compared to these two !! **(No, just chess, nothing sinister or dodgy !! LMAO)"
"Hi, I don't know anything about chess, but even not understanding what was going on, I really enjoyed this game. Emotions and simply lovely people, it was a joy to spend this 18 minutes with you"
"The weakest, least confident people are always the biggest talkers."
"Good god, you have a terrible accent"
Nice
Stay in the UK for a while and you'll lose some of that Yankee doodle accent....
"I think maybe he was a little smitten by your looks. I must admit that I myself wasn't really paying attention to the game. He made me laugh when he said, ""You can mate me in 20 seconds."""
Exciting game. Congrats for beating the charming guy!
"There is no such thing as ""a friendly game of chess""; it is all violence, humiliation, and murder."
I think you could have played c5 right after he played h4. GG! I'm guessing he's 1600. That pole is only for catching fish.
I'm guessing that he had a 2150 rating. What was it ?
"He was a gentleman, he let the Lady win!"
"Girl gets off on her autistic savant skill while belittling a polite, charismatic young man who could not only bench press her body weight, but will be called to service to die in the war she votes for. Unplug, lads. Theyre narcissistic."
"Discovered you a couple weeks ago, watched several videos without even knowing how to play chess, got intrigued , downloaded a chess learning app and now Im addicted to both chess and your videos! Thanks girl!"
I was wondering if he was going to pull this Russian master stuff to intimidate her more.
I know nothing about chess but I can see his body language change two and a half minutes in as he began to realize this was not going to be easy.
I have never played chess and dont know anybody in my family that plays it. This is my first visit to your channel. But its been fun especially liked when you played the 11-year-old.
BLAH! get a room!
"At 16.55 the game is summed up when they guy says to her ""Will you mate me in 20 seconds?"""
Incredible...
"I enjoyed that! Frankly, I knew he was in trouble when he refused to castle. And I believe that he knew he was in trouble when you refused both his Bishop and Knight sacrifices. Well done Anna."
"I'm AWFUL at chess. It's just not how brain works. I'm a fantastic writer and musician, but as a tactician I'm a bag of shit. It's really fun to watch people who have that skill play though. Good on ya."
I THINK HE WAS SMITTEN BY YOU.
Thank you for this channel its very relaxing- I dont even play chess.
Anna showing some cleavage - a major distraction
"So, are you dating yet?"
"First time watching, I loved it because you explained why you do things. It's still a bit faster than I can perceive, but I was on the edge of understanding which is fine."
"The talking is a common tactic of men. The way he talked through your whole turn and then saying that you're running out of time as he constantly tried to interupt your thinking. My sister, sisters-in-law, mom and I play code words against my brothers (I have 6 brothers). They talk the whole time it's our turn to try to distract us or make us mad, but it doesn't work: we're all mothers. We don't try to do that to them (though if we quietly talk they get mad at us) and we absolutely demolish them every time. They get so mad. Just play the game, not your opponent."
"He was clearly underestimating you for simply being a woman, I doubt he would have given any other men advice. Good for you to keep your smile but this is making me really mad to watch :D Still a long way to go but anyways - congrats!"
the girl in the background kicked arse too
i couldnt play chess to save my life ..
What is the song in the background? Sounds so warm and yummy in my ears.
Nice!
Purple shirt = Bishop's shirt
Pretty good format. Works. And yes.. like another round..
"great game, great fun!"
"Chess noob here. Can someone please explain to me, at 13:00, why didn't white move his queen to E6? That takes a pawn whilst also putting her King in check. As she has to counter the check, he then gets a free knight on B6 whilst also threatening the bishop on B7. That means if Anna decides to save her B7 bishop, the guy gets to save his own D3 bishop that was being threatened in the first place. As far as I can tell, he missed a free pawn and knight and a counter to her threat."
Beautiful game
"I want to see it all, Anna. I'm getting hooked!"
And some people say chess is boring. This was a full length action movie with a cool chasing sequence Not sure how I ended up on the chess side of YouTube but I like it
Tom was drinking too much and his mind game didnt work. Good for her. She was the better strategist.
wow! that's amazing
So to prove a point hot women that are competitive club players for years challenge men without that background. Next female sprinter proves a point by defeating a truck driver in sprinting. Brave new world.
You are so good so nice to see your games
You're a badass! Great game!
"the Queen has won... whot? You cant beat russia, they are completly mad as Bismarck said. My bishop... oh my god! Jazz is something weird. Imagine you play with a wonderfull dream woman... you've lost."
Yep would like to see next round!
Toms in love ...
Women should not play chess
You know you would be a perfect pair? Both play very good chess. Both were very attractiv and very sympathic. Hope you have a nice Wedding.
"yes, more please"
guess the open blouse helps. good old trick.
"I don't know why the algorithm brought you to me, lol, but this was fun! I know what chess is, but I am unfamiliar with strategy, so it's cool to have you explain all the moves!!"
"This is cute, now kith..."
Tom might be 1500-1600
he likes your low cut top also
I dont know a thing about chess so for me it is just about the psychological aspect. Fun.
Young lady I cant help but notice that most of your videos seem to be about being underestimated and proving you are better.
"Anna, you are so hot. Not just because you're beautiful, but also so smart."
It's amazing how many moves ahead these people can think.
Tom 1800
"More than a chess game going on here. Mansplaining, feminine distractions to break his concentration"
"Wow, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND CHESS lolll"
Noticed a lot of the 'talkers' only start talking when they notice how good their opponent is.
"He made some bad moves, must have been distracted, lol!"
Yo I just watched a whole game of chess but you made it interesting. Never thought I'd do that.
"His rating is ""smiley"""
You and Tom make a very cute couple. Just sayin'.
"That, my friend, was a real game. Simply fantastic"
Nice boobs.. and I no longer like chess since about 1974..
You had me on my toes Anna!!!
Mansplaining at its Best. You go Anna!
"I guess he CAN beat you in chess, he just didn't."
Id of said overall near 1800. But at the start he made a judgement you wasnt going to be that good so tried to play you because the arrogance he showed was startling. You played a great game
Did you see his flat?
Well played
Nothing like cherrypicking to make yourself look good
Question is How many pints of beer did Tom drink that day
2050? That was a good game there.
Thank you for clear and straightforward comments on the moves and position!
I immediately guessed you are in London! Next move: bypass bishop with your pawn. Just guessing; I stopped playing chess some 30-40 yrs. ago.
"What is the difference between ""positional chess"" and ""this kind"" of chess? I thought ALL chess was positional... post script, I wonder how he would have felt, being beaten by that little kid that beat Anna a little while bsck."
Wow what an original concept!!
I hope you and Tom became friends.
"I haven't played chess in 25 years.... so I have no idea of what you could have done better. All I know is you took it to the wire. As to the young mans stats. He must have been a 2400. I have no idea if that makes sense. But, you make me want to get back into the game again. You have wonderful wholesome content. Keep it up!"
As a non-chess player it was entertaining to watch and insightful into the game.
"not sure it's fair to headline ""overconfidence"" here"
"I've never been interested in chess until now.I love your attitude and narration,lets see the semi-finals and I hope we get more of your wonderful narritation .And I would love to see you win first prize!"
great!
"He was telling you good moves because he was trying to flirt with you, also he's an average player. His strategy is to hope the opponent makes a mistake so he can capitalize instead of just mounting a good offense"
I would compare him to a 2275 I play often
"10(!) min. ""speed"" chess, lots of talking and wasting time on almost every move."
I'm sensing some sexual tension between you two....
2 percent of all current Chess Grand Masters are women.
Tom's rating is not as good as you.
Lovely great game.
what is the name of his opening/progression?
purple shirt for women's month!
The guy who beat 80% there.......But not you
"If we watched this game, yea we want to see the semifinals"
"Don't know how I ended up here. I don't even know how to play chessBut it is kind of interesting, even though I understand literally nothing"
"Check out the 'en passant' move for pawns. You could have used this move to take his bishop with your black pawn - the one that is closest to the camera. I've used this move a lot in chess, and no-one seems to know it!!!"
You are so cute :)))
"5:58 he has a check mate in 2 moves. knight e4 to f6 and (check) you would have to do bishop e7 to f6. and he would end with bishop e3 to h7, correct?"
"If I was Tom, the next thing I'd do is asked her out to dinner"
Tom's endgame was to play with her chess
"Arrogance countered, very nicely done"
YES !!!!!!
He's a windbag Glad you won
"His shirt was purple, but it worked on him."
"I'm guessing Tom's around 1700-1900. Are you going to answer here in comments or divulge his rating or do you even know it? I also enjoyed reading all the comments too. You have a very cordial and charming audience it seems. Good luck to you, Anna! Keep it coming! I love your content!"
Tom is a very handsome man! Great smile <3
Have never tried chess and don't think I could ever learn it either.
Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurl!!!!
congrates
Nice work with 16.1 seconds left!
I have several pants about that color purple I love them golf pants
Being pretty is cheating
"Followed to the end of the game, you're a killer Anna. Subscribed."
"To save you 20 minutes, she beats him."
You rocked. Way to stay cool.
Good attack.
Great chess match. Love the explanations. Nice to see you guys having fun! Chess is a great game. Thank you
Go Anna!
"At least Anna was drinking real beer ,while the lightweight was drinking light beer ?"
Semi finals: bring it on!
Wtf of course I want to see the semis
Not a chess player but was wondering.......is 10 minutes on the clock a standard amount of time? Is it just an agreed amount of time? In professional chess what is the time? Tks.
Hope he learned something.
And after the wedding the adopted a dragon and had loads of kids and lived happily ever after
I don't for a second believe the guy. Big smile and all. His whole thing was to play mind games---not chess ! So glad to see her beat this devious actor.
"Great video in every way--music, clarity, and commentary."
yes please would love to see the final game and this game if possible !! Thank you - you are a great chess player !!
I love how you explained all of it ! Congrats on winning !
Brilliant analysis Anna- you got me- i'm subscribed
Wow! He blushed as he was shaking your hand. He was in shock.
i like chess - i hate clock masturbating.
I just come for your good nature sportsmanship and beautiful smile
Someone needs to tell TOM to shut the F up no one cares his thoughts
I'm just happy when I don't blunder a winning position into checkmate against Emir. I swear to god that AI is bullshit
There was definitely something going on between you and Tom other than Chess! Just sayin...
"Never really got chess, the game of kings ! But great to watch you,...."
"Purple shirt; extra points 4 sure. His rating? Pretty but, perhaps therefore, overconfident. Very enjoyable to watch. Thank you."
"Let's face it, she always has the advantage against straight men, because she's so attractive. In all honesty, human evolution dictates that my eyes be drawn to her, thereby cutting down by some percentage, the time that I'd normally be eyeing the board."
"Great game, looked like you were really having fun. I'm in London, I will check out this venue"
5600
"Too much laughing and drinking alcohol. You play against a Married guy, you won't get as many laughs."
"I see the less time you have, the better you play. You should start the game with just 20s on your clock :D"
"I don't play chess, but it was fun watching you two going back and forth and smiling and laughing with each other. Had me smiling, too."
You distracted him with your beauty ;-)
Love the commenting! Also good music selectionbut your explanation makes a huge difference in your videos.
They make a handsome couple.
He was trying to flirt but was a bit awkward.
"I'm not a chess player, I recommend speeding up these videos to actually see the game progress."
Nail biter because of time.
You guys would make a cute couple
Its a pleasure watching your work!
I can't decide if it would be fun or annoying to be that good/smart as well as beautiful. I have a feeling its probably both at times.
Anna is so nice and charmy.
like and subscribe for the clevage!
GOOD JOB
play fair-wear a turtle neck
"Wow you sure have come a long way since I first saw you, im glad to see that since you are awesome! nskar dig all lycka till fr framtiden. Unfortunately I could not watch this video since it was lagging all the time, I have no problem with other videos but this one was super laggy for some reason."
Good game! Great play!
"You can see she is cool under pressure because she does not let the corner attack on her king determine her move and focuses elsewhere, thinking a few moves ahead."
Just know if I tell you that you're going to suffer while your playing me it's probably because I ate Taco Bell yesterday.
He is super cute. Maybe you should get to know him.
You might make a good couple...
he keeps on telling you what to do so that he can take credit for your win
Brilliant chess in a cliffhanger!!
Love it !
He should have castled when he had the chance
He probably wanted to prolong being in your presence. I would have.
He threw that match a long time ago
That was beautiful!
Pretty ironic that the first price in a chess tournement is a substace that kills your brain cells ;)
You always play the pussy privilege. Its obnoxious
"Nice work! I'm a ""hobbyist"" player but I enjoy watching masters of the craft."
i i dont think he was over confident
It was so great to watch two competitors having fun and being good sports. Good on him for handling this so well.
"Im not a chess player, this video was in my recommendations (no idea why) - but you two were giggly and so cute lol. Any chance there will be a second chess date?"
Semi's yes please.
"Nice one Anna. Sure, I would love to see the rest of your tournament."
"Do you want to ask me out, Anna Cramling?"
"Do you want to ask me out sometime, Anna Cramling, HUH?"
"My brother and I played chess quite a bit. Then he was drafted (he was 5 years older than me). We played others and always came out on top. I never achieved your level, and I love your videos. I have very little remembrance of the game now, but I do know it can get intense. Good luck, I admire younger people who engage the usage of their thinking capabilities."
2300
Is his elo 1800?
This one lost when he didn't take the queen.
Nice win!
Love chess.. taught my 2 sons and grandson.. I still win..
"Not seen this lovely lady before ... but, damn ... what a joy and delight to watch this young brain whup up on the opposition. She makes it look so easy ... but some of those moves are truly amazing. Thank you for a delightful hour or so. One of the best, most enjoyable, AND analytical brains with a wonderful attitude I've ever seen in the game. Thank you dear Anna."
What about overconfident girl? Shoot a video on that. Checkmate!
"Yup nice calm and gathered, you did pretty well beating the purple dude.well done host"
"Of course he couldn't, you are Gods gift to chess and to youtube, aren't you Anna? How I which I couldn't block this disgusting channel, but I can't, it kerps coming up."
Feminists are total shit at chess.
You can be cordial without talking about the game.
a ten min game took 18 mins of video
Scored 0 .. Im a cheap tingle drunk
LOVELY !!! CONGRATULATIONS !!! LOT'S OF GUYS THINK THEY ARE WAY BETTER AT ALL MOST ANYTHING THAN WOMEN !!! YOU SHOW THEM SWEET !!!!
Youve got such a beautiful aura
"""but can you mate me in 21 seconds"" does it in 5"
Loved it. First time watching a game. So much fun.
"he seems drunk Edit: ""it almost seems like he was helping me"" >.> ...yuuup.. decolteu will do that to a man."
They were all smiling cos they were getting a good look at your tits!
"he was giving you the game throughout, tried so many time to give you wins throughout the game, i am shocked it took this long, you must have seen this editing."
Just look at all the flirting chess love you can't beat it
"16:05 - his rating is 10/10 he's cute, you two would make a cute couple.... oh you mean chess rating... I'd say he's probably FM/IM?"
1:33 I LOVE THIS LADIES ORANGE DRESS.
I think the only reason the game was so close was him flirting with you caught you off your game. lol
2050
"I'm impress! I wanna see what's going on, next round."
Anna he is flirting with you!!!
Probably 1750?
All anyone wants to know is who slept with who.
I know nothing about chess and thoroughly enjoyed this. Post more please.
You'd think they'd be smart enough just to get up and swap seats instead of moving all the pieces at the start.
lets see the next game
toms rating is 1743 what is it....also anna your english needs a bit of help just a little. shook hands not shaked. there were several other mistakes.
"a) She's not an especially good chess player, even when ranked among women only -- at her peak, she's around 450th in the world. b) The only reason she's got 900,000 subscribers is that she's young, blonde and hot. If she was a man who played at the same level, nobody would ever hear about him. Or care."
Anna seriously kicked his butt. He should have spent all that time he ended up with by analyzing his game moves earlier. It seemed to me that once he did not get the easy beginners' checkmate he seemed to deflate and never really threatened Anna again.
I think you were smiling because you liked the guy in the purple shirt. LOL
How can you sit across from her and concentrate...
Long time follower.. I really enjoy hearing your commentary on your thoughts for the game. Please keep the videos coming. :)
His face was turning red.
Women can't quit talking even while playing chess.
Women play Chess???
He likes you Anna .
Purple is a high vibration color Happy to watch you win!!!
You go girl
"I am sorry however that miss jumps her king with the tower , only the horse can jump over pieces so she is a faillure. otherwise said her eight move is illegal"
"I dont play or know how to play, but this was entertaining to watch. Good game and congratulations on the win."
I LOVE the way you talk through your vision of the board. Most chess YouTubers talk WAAAAAY over the average chess players head. You ROCK! Thanks for sharing this awesome game. I was actually able to see many of the processes that you saw. Well played!
Is there an address or website for this club? I'd like to check it out one day
great video
My guess for his rating is 1800.
"Fellas with the hoodies and beers standing over the dude player, were looking at Anna...."
Just a stone's throw from the Imperial War Museum. That's a fantastic part of town.
You keep chatting to throw the opponent off their guard
His rating was panic!! That smile was a grimace of realisation Nicely played.
I don't even know the basics of how to play chess but I enjoyed the video.
Augh! What is he rated? What are you rated? Great tactics. Watching from Kazakhstan.
"Great content...One thing, TO SHAKE is an irregular verb so the past tense is shook, not shaked. Your English is fantastic overall."
I think Tom is 1900
Was he really over confident? Seems like a nice chap to me
He is desirous to mate you.
"They had little kids playing in the tournament? I thought you said the prize was alcohol. You were joking? I don't know anything about chess ratings, so I have to rate him as a charming guy and great dresser with nice hair ."
"I don't need this video to know that girls can be as good, or better than boys! There is basically no difference between man and woman, when we consider brain power."
I always like seeing the overly-chatty ones defeated.
+++++++!
Are you even old enough to drink beer? Because you look about sixteen to me!
Purple shirt
Definitely would like to see The next video on the semi finals.
mate great game!
"yes, let's see the semifinal Anna!"
maybe he is 1600?
What beer was that?
Tom seems like a good sport.
"Good game, Anna. Cheers !"
You two are cute together. I dont know much about chess.
Why not bishop a2 at 5:04 to continue the attack on Annas left side? Can bring the bishop behind the queen.
He was busy looking elsewhere.
"I was smiling, Tom was smiling, the barman was smiling, Jesus was smiling"
Great
Rook C8 against guuen C5 dorsntnt work becauce of Bishop g7 check .
"""I don't know why we were smiling so much""... oh sweet girl... you were flirting like sapiophiles."
Tom 1600 add 50pts per pint consumption. Very much a good sport and gentlemen.
Loving it. Love the fun!!
Where is this please?
Anna I am not a chess player but you make watching these videos fun anyway. I think you maybe are the best that could happen to get the sport wider spread again. You are a blessing to the sport. Please keep doing these kind of videos
yes i would love to see the semi finals please.... ohio . us here
Why she tells every small detail of their game lol
very impressed
"Why at the beginning of the video when she picks the hand to decide colours, Why don't they just spin the board around?"
"Guys, just be honest, you were smiling because you wanted to have a sexual intercourse. It's just so visible... great video."
Bit of a mansplainer there.
Yes please post the rest of the tournament
you should of given tom a big loss kiss!!!
yes please
1800
At the end you should have checked with the Black Knight and then check made it with the queen
Nice game and well played!
"It's always 80 percent for some reason, the Pareto law. Tom is the main dish over there in the London"
He played like 1900.
"Everyone was smiling, because you are both attractive people, and he was flirting with you. Nothing wrong with that at all. Thanks for sharing the match with us!"
I really enjoyed the game. Amazing last minute too.
Really nice game and video. Thank you!
Rating 2400? I think U both like each other
"Whats Toms rating? Before, or after the beers?"
I don't play chess anf I don't know why yt suggedted this video to me. I can't believe I watched the whole 18mins and truly enjoyed it!!!!!!
great game Anna! but I thought Tom was a bit clumsy towards the end
That was fun.. enjoyed that.
"It has been ages since I played chess. One thing I never played with a clock. I knew how then just the other person I played we would let the game go on. I could be wrong, could not Tom let the clock run that when time is up the person with time wins. I also played where a player had to take a piece, if it was there, to be taken. You all did not. Also, just to make it harder we would play anyone leaves check more than three times loses. To me, both of you were playing below your levels and having fun. The guy I played most times, we would have moves figured at least 5 to 6 ahead. I was the only person he had not beat, within 12 or 14 moves. I have been the only person to win against him. My friend beat a chess champion/president of the chess club, from Princeton or Harvard. He did so in 18 moves. He could have in 12 he told me. His wife asked him to let her BFF boyfriend, in letting him play longer. To let know, the players to your right, his left, had finish faster, so you two were having a go longer on fun."
"Liked it, well done for winning."
can i marry you!
Of course we want more matches.
I was guessing him at 2100
Channel your inner Pia and Juan. Edit: That young man was trying to get you on a date.
2300?
Great game !
He was being patronizing by telling the little woman how to play.
yes
When you play chess...concentration and thinking v talk!ing...
You know those cute kitten&puppy videos you watch to brighten your day . I deleted all of mine and replaced them with Anna videos . Not sure whats more infectious the smile or the laugh. Love what you do and how you do it. P.S youre mom kinda scares me a bit.
Were good to go.. you're good to go...... don't you just hate that silly overly Americanized saying! yuk!
Smart girl
More more more!
Tom is 2130 ?
Anna! Glad you're having a good time..this IS Tom (he's not dead yet)
*checks Amazon for purple shirts*
"I paused this several times just to keep up and ponder what I would do - well done , and I look forward to more !!"
"I would say that his rating is higher than yours, but I believe that he was very distracted by such a beautiful girl and I believe that was why he was laughing so much."
Ot reslly fsmikiar with the rating but i say 1800 rating? Not castling is odd
"wow, really enjoyable match... first chess vid I've watched on YT and it was excellent"
Anna your smile and kindness warms my heart!
Hardly 1500
"Dropping beer here in the UK is considered Alcohol abuse, shame on you lady, shame I say! :D"
He could Defiantly have played better. It was more Fun to Him than for You.
total guess tom might be a 1800seems ok
Tom would be a good boyfriend for you.
i would not mind losing 1000 games against Anna :) Guess most of you can imagine why ;)
Never drink and drive. Or play chess
2000
He wasn't overconfident at all. Looks like a regular nice guy.
Very enjoyable to watch. Thanks.
He underestimated you. Well done!
Great video Anna. Loved you highlighting the London Knight Club.
Anna is getting hotter . . .
whats the point of not castling ? Tom guy is so ridiculous...
"Its not ""shaked"", its shook, cause there aint no such things as halfway crooks..."
Tom ask Anna for a date
"0:37 optionally, you could just swap seats"
Yes
he realizes he lost right at 8:45 when he makes the lippy face
YES WANT THE NEXT ROUND
"Tom actually could win, he had so many occasions to gain materials"
I simply cannot make myself follow chess. But this friendly game was as fun to watch as The Queen's Gambit.
"Yes, would like too see the next round please"
It a good feeling to walk into a chess club and beat the grand master.
Anna that is alcohol abuse when you spill your beer!
My guess 1850
Wait! You can't tell us to guess his rating and then not tell us what his rating is!
Guessing 1750. Well done!
Fantastic match.
I am smiling because I'm in deep kimchee.
Myewvs
"Anna, you are as cute as a bug, but you are really a Great White Shark! Laughing."
1900 max
Tom's a 1900
1800
"So, did she ever say what Tom's rating is? If she wasn't, she should ask the question."
Good game!
I don't know anything about chess... but it's clear that he has a crush on you. You beat him with all your personality... not just your mastery of chess. Your mastery just knock it out.
Is it really fair to your opponent to be so cute and dress like that?
Amazing!! I was on the edge of my seat. Learned a lot from this play.
Tom knows how to get a date. Let the girl win
Great game Anna .
Yes. We want the next game! I bet Tom's rating is about 2100.
If I could play Chess I would lose playing you by your beauty
I think his rating is really good.
Yes please
Great video
"7:37 because mansplaining, so annoying tho"
1900
I love it when girls drink beer! There's something about it that... well.. Yeah :)
Yes lets see more! Glad you are in the UK showjng how its done . Im such a novice but love watching you slay ;)!
Tom didn't play well at all
"Yes please Anna, good fun."
Yeah stream the next match too please :)
SHe's cute ... very distracting
The last 6 months I've been watching these different chess subscriptions and I don't see a way to distinguish gender if we didn't know by appearance. What I mean is the thought process of both men and women seemingly become the same in a in a chess game. There's only so many options whichever is the best move based on what you know and how you play you wouldn't know if I'm a man or a woman if you didn't know so it's refreshing to see that under the high pressure or having to make a tough decision that its approach the same way regardless of gender
Brilliant Anna! Lets see you win more!
It would be helpful to show the address and not assume theres only one Knight Club in London?
"Nice video, btw it's we ""shook"" hands, rather than we ""shaked"" hands"
Tom is an 8 Anna is a 10
Of course I want to see it
"I don't understand chess, I don't play chess, I don't like chess, yet I watched the whole video."
"Wait a minute Anna I got the trick, you barely touched your beer whilst Tom went on thirsty mode troughout the game"
Well done
That was a fun match to watch. I am not a chess player but I love that you seemed to turn losing into a win. Well done.
is this queen's gambit season 2 ?
just watched all smiles here to - nice job maybe a 1700?
"You are a strong player Anna you play already very well against a strong tactical player like Witty Alien so if an another players underestimate yourself, this is just to your advantage!Enjoy your great win!"
"Anna, your channel is better than most TV shows."
That took the smug look off his face.
He is purple he is killgrave
Toms rating: 2000
In chess?
1500?
Nice game. Satisfying to see this condescending man lose!
nice one - i dont play much these days but could still follow it
Yes I want to see all of your tournaments
Tom was right. He was only expressing the Buddhist insight that life inevitably involves suffering.
"Someone who is used to winning often tells people how to do things, confident they cant be beaten. A little arrogant until it all goes wrong"
Just turn the board around after deciding colour. Why grab all the pieces to set up again ?
he is just a big patzer with zero tactics skills
Is this the beginning of a love story?
Congratulations!
2320
I got to play a five time. Chess champion at his house with his personal super nice custom chess set. And I crushed him I honestly barely knew how to play the game But it really did affect him
You wasted valuable time with could have cost you. You have to remember that the clock keeps ticking while you're trying to figure out every possible move and counter move.
Anna is Just So Sexy
Tom's rating is drunk and congrats!
"Not only fun, they can dominate in everything"
Great fun
Beer score 1:0 ...
I gave up after 1min 40sec you said 16 TIMES I...I...I ..I...I. .I...I ..I...I...I...I ..I...I ..I ..I ..I ..
I see a very normal nice guy..........I hear an overconfident woman or girl here
Anna just crushed him.
I think he was spending too much time flirting with Anna. Good play but I wonder if you had been a man if the result would have been different? Maybe he was just weak as a number of his latter moves seemed to achieve nothing. He looked like he was just trying to bully you off the board.
his rating is 1200 :)
at 8:43 - could you go rock A6?
Wow.
That was awesome!
"He seems an absolute bell, glad you humbled him."
"the trash talk on this guy makes him very unlikeable, overconfident and greasy. Well done for always being a cool person, Anna, especially against someone like this"
"Anyone this talkative (drunk or not) and says that they never castle is probably sitting around 1100. Has the skills to be better but doesn't want to learn to play positional chess while still being good enough to ""never castle"". Totally egotistical and thinks he can be Magnus without the experience. Magnus can only ""just play chess"" the way he does from his study of chess theory. Hilarious to watch."
"Fuck, listening to you explaining chess is like listening to poetry. And those eye flashes knowing that you're going to beat his arse.. ahh"
1750 Not sure but just a guess! lol We will see if I'm correct.
"You are great, and i love your video. but in this video too much commentery let us hear the trush talk"
"Guys, what's going on, end of the video I hear her say 'Sammy-finals', and not semi-finals. Write below if you hear the same.."
"lies, u smiling cause he cute"
Nice seeing the board displayed so well and the moves highlighted. Both players in nice bright clean fashion colors..
"Time code 7:00: ""..he was telling me he thought my b4 'mewv' was a bit of a strange mewv"". :-) I never heard anyone pronounce the word 'move' this way :-)"
"Instead of Ne4 after Qxb2, maybe he should have played Nxe6."
16:59 love it!
My dream girl
"i think he is about 12 year old scotish school kid level in chesse, didnt impress me."
"Yes! Show me the semifinals and. the conclusion of the tourney, but only if you're in it! GRATS!"
My guess is he's rated 1975!
"Just found this channel, you're such a chill and worthy opponent.. you made me want to learn how to play.. I'm truly excited to see how it goes for me.. thanks for the videos! From San Diego"
"he seams like the kind that cant refuse a peice. he went fromon bishope in danger to 2 for a pawn and a loss of position. not just arogant, a poor player."
"this is a winable situation, you need to be sneeky, no sacrifice make him think he is taking you retreat but think what can i do with my rook?"
Lets see the next round please
"Toms rating, I have no clue, but what I do know is Tom has a crush on you"
"You earned that beer, enjoy it. Also, that dark purple color is my favorite."
Sometimes you sound like a Gingerbread girl Anna
Probably 2200
Yes show the Semis. Please.
guessing his rating is 1750
"Regarding the top comment being your quote stating you're smiling because you are winning... I think many people are simply jealous and are happy when you say anything that relieves them from believing you might actually be enjoying a moment in time with a smart, handsome man. In my heart, I like to believe you were smiling for both reasons"
"14:20 Haha, this was cute."
Was a great game.
What would have happened if you played rook a3?
Where in London is this?
"Does Tom knows she is from the Cramling family ....then he should know he has no chance, he isn't even in the same league"
saying b4 is weird is obviously flirting. it looks like a perfectly reasonable space take
You are always a buzzer beater gurl. Well done!
"I don't know about ratings for either of you, but I rate specific pieces of the game separately: 1) opening tactics and understand of follow-through - low rating for both players. You both know the form of the openings, but made comments and moves which show that you quickly devolve your play to two steps ahead thinking. 2) Situational piece awareness (means understanding splits, islands, how to get back to center if you find the board split, etc. - no rating as neither player seems to know anything about this and anna suggested she ""doesn't like this"" piece of the game, which is no surprise. It's memorization and bobby is rolling in his grave. 3) End game setup plays - Here both score slightly better. I would say middle of the road ability to plan far enough ahead to catch a king or two. 4) masking your intentions - Neither has any intentions of note, so we cannot evaluate this at present. The male thought he was doing this, but was just talking nonense as anna noted. Practice 1-3 for more fun with bad players!"
min 15. he missed another trick or treat splitting the knight and pawn with his queen.
"still min 14 and haven't seen his move after queen to C2 from anna. He can just move his queen straight back now and check block the queen, since she lined up the stupid pawn. From here, there would be many choices for him. my guess is he stupid blunders forward or takes a side piece. Pattern of beviour with these two."
"Min 14... queen to C2 anna, seriously? Go back and think some more and next time, pawn to D2, stronger position. Then, you move other pawn to B3 and press for a second queen. This is why he wasn't taking your knight, he thought you saw the end game. You didn't. He's bad, you know nothing."
"Pedestrian play at best with serious flaws on both sides. Anna has the biggest facepalm at min 12 missing queen to F2 check, followed by taking 2 more pieces (at least one pawn and one face piece). From here, and I haven't finished watching, I practically cannot watch this anymore... Do you two play chess?"
does anybody ever beat you ? amazing
do you really have to redo the pieces again after finding out which color you are going to play it ? what's the purpose ? couldn't you just flip the board ?
Sounds like the gattaca soundtrack
I can't see what's overconfident at all seems like a nice interaction
"Anna, Past tense of ""shake"" is ""shook."" We ""shook hands,"" not ""we shaked hands."" That aside, your English is excellent, just like your chess."
Well Done 4 Putting The Beer Down.. I Know It Takes A Lot
"Beer, the cause of and solution to all of life's problems."
Congrats Anna!
He is probably around 1800 elo
A bit of a clickbaity title. I didn't get any impression he was overconfident in any way.
Lovely game! You looked so intimidating and confident.
Genia total... Felicitaciones As se educa a los atrevidos! Saludos desde ARG
"Even when he's explaining why he got beat, he still comes across like he's trying to teach you. Maybe it's just his upper class accent, but it sounds like he's actually mansplaining why he got mated by a girl."
He's about 2000
Great game Anna
I watch the interaction more than the strategy as a (very novice) chess player myself. I almost find that equally interesting.
Its Chess NOT Chass! Could you start to speak English?
nice game. yes i want to see the semi final !
I think Tom liked you a bit....
Chass and miuws?
Anna you should put his rating up ! You made everyone intrigued and then left us hanging :(
Hes annoying.
"I bet that he also loved his game with Anna. Probably was distrated by the real ""queen"" of chess just in front of him!"
hes probably 1700
This was so adorable honestly :)
great game
"this ""was"" Tom ..., what a start"
His level is overconfident local boy.
The most exciting game of chess I ever watched. Please show next one
17:57 Yesss we want more ^_^
I would guess 1900.
Cute
"Well played! It seemed like he was polite and tried to relate to you about spilling beer on the board...he also took the loss well. If he sees this video, do you think he might feel a bit betrayed by you calling him overconfident in the title...and isn't the point of playing the game because you think you have a chance to beat the other player?"
You played an excellent game Anna. I saw a move or two that I would have done differently but your end game was very well played. His rating looked to be 1650 to 1750. Yours 1850+ Guy in Columbia Mississippi
"Really enjoyed this game Anna! He was really trying to work that fishing pole variation Hoping you would take either the Bishop early on, or the knight later with your H pawn. You knew better Wishing you continued success, and enjoyment!"
1600?
The way this guy plays is probably at 1600-1700 fide elo he blundered a lot and also said that he never castles
I want to see the semifinal
He is about 1650 l .max
They should have just banged lmao
This is a great format - thanks for the great commentary. Glad you won!
Are you sure you're old enough to be drinking? Either way you are beautiful inside your mind and on your face and I think you have a good future ahead of you sweetheart God bless you
"There is one strategy point you forgot about, the guy is out of is confort zone with you, pretty girl !"
"Love the way she pronounces ""move""."
Show us the semi final round please
16.1 enjoyed that
"Why am I watching Chess videos, I don't even play Chess LOL...."
semi finals please!
"Excuse me!? Cheap flirting tactics under cover of having fun ""...that is what chess is all about..."" NOT!"
"Merci Anna, c'tait bien jou, vous avez un don"
Lol nice! Do you still practice using Chess Engine & AI from the Unity asset store?
"...at chess, honey!"
HE IS TOO ENGROSSED IN CHEST N GIGGLING.HE IS PRE EJACULATION GUY.
show the next if its against the guy who was flirting with you earlier!!
He had a beer in 20 minutes and was already there for 5 hours. You can now calculate and make a conclusion about the reason why he was laughing that much.
Was I only one thinking bishop
this guy is definitely not over 1800 FIDE
"I've never been overly involved with chess and came across this video by accident. My goodness, that was exciting!"
Anna was so in love hahaha btw he's probably 1800
1500
You liked him
"""Why are you telling your opponent what the best move would be?"", ""Look, the difference between us is that you play chess to prove something to yourself and others and I only play chess because I love it."""
He was 2000+ until he saw her
Very wholesome chess game!
Very exciting video!
Toms rating (in my opinion) 2100 maybe
CHAK MATE
"""Can you beat me in 20 seconds...?"" Well, she did it in 5 ;) That was a fun game. Such a cool comunity."
Hot and smart !!!You are so fkg sexy !!!
He had the hits for you I really think that affected his game play. Still a well executed game on your part. I would say his Elo is 2000
Beautiful.
Yes to semifinals
"Anna, very enjoyable video. You seem like a very nice person. Smiling and enjoying..."
"Next round, please?"
mansplainer :)
"I think he is 1600 ELO, but I am reading the comments now and they say he has actually got a rating of 1800-1900 ELO"
Tom = 1400
"His advice wasn't advice, he was a smiling assassin with a big ego ,proud of u girl"
Bring on all yr games from the tournament
Could it be that ana kinda liked the guy in the purpel shirt? I bet they went out afterwards
Love you Anna. Boop on the nose from your fans in Australia.
More please.
The hard question is: Why do all* the boys stand at the left of the camera? Nice win!
His ratings seems 1600-1500
i wAnna see it !
He was mansplaining chess to his opponent.
Next round please!
"""D SAVEN""?? ""M0W"" .. please learn some proper English"
Rating guess: 1850. Of course we want to see the next match.
I watched the whole video. Here is a comment you should read. The name of the video strokes your ego too much. It makes me not want to watch it. This guy is arguably better than you and almost beat you in this game even though he played not as good in the opening. Your not that good he believed he could beat you because he can.
"Yes, please- show the next round"
"I'd say he was about 1800, maybe less. Might sound low but his style was typical of that kind of rating. He wins through bamboozling players by being tricky and forcing panic mistakes, but he was not solid and his game ended up falling apart (also typical of that rating)."
Nice game; nice win; and with 16 seconds to spare ;) Fred
"Ok, Anna just won me over as a fan. I had come across her videos before, but since I hadn't played chess in a long time, I wasn't too interested in the topic, so I never watched them for more than a minute or two. I also sort of assumed that she might just be another YouTuber hedging her appearance for attention.. However, the title of this video really caught my eye. I was curious to see how things would play out, particularly interested in hearing her thoughts while playing against an 'overconfident guy'. Tom was indeed highly confident, not in an arrogant way, but he was suggesting moves for Anna to make. Hopefully, that was just meant to throw her off her game and not for any other reason. Either way, I figured she might have been taken aback by this, but no, she took it in complete stride and didn't try to show up Tom in any way. Her chill, easy-going and cordial demeanor made for enjoyable viewing, along with her talent. It was wrong of me to think that Anna was just 'looking the part', because her game is quite pretty too."
go back and get toms number
I've got to stop watching these videos. You're too delightful.
Anna is so beautiful!
"@AnnaCramling Great breakdown. You honestly made things look so easy and explained things very well. Also, you made it really easy to understand everything being said"
What a toxic video title!! He was friendly and wholesome and you make him sound like a toxic male.
The look you give him was to funny lmao
"just had break and boozed it up. Watch this video and think, ""hey, I'd love a beer!"" So now I'm watching the video with a pint like all the other spectators. Thanks Anna!"
Nice job.
"Cramling, your father, old fox, has not told you how to win, ""Mas Vale Maa que Fuerza"", is the strategy that wins. You need to trick your opponent to do something that will cost him dearly at the end. Have you seen the video on the Belgian Malinois and the German Shepard behavior? the German, plays straight, the Belgian finds the way to overcome the obstacles that you put in front of him. These are two different kinds of dogs."
Fun video to watch and Tom is such a nice guy!
Whaaaat Anna?!!!! Yeees we obviously want to see the semifinals! I wouln't forgive you if you don't show us the Semis!
Nice Got em with seconds to go cant believe this guy wouldve been glad if he won on time you destroyed him Good Game Anna
lichess rating guess for Tom 1750
"You are great Anna, congrats!"
"yes, next round."
Two people who cant stop smiling.
Go Anna! Great game and everyone had fun. Doesn't get better than that. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the tournament.
Why Putting A Majuscule At The Beginning Of Each Word ???
Can we see more videos on this tournament thanks
"11:02 Qc5 Rc8 Bh7+ Kxh7 Rxd8 here if you take the queen, he takes the rook, and he's up two points. If you take his rook and not the queen, he is also up two points I could completely be missing something here, does anyone else see a better line?"
Please post the semi-final video
gentle tom. to win his heart its better to lose instead of killing him.
I watched the whole of this
"God doesnt want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). Were not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because were sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. Weve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said It is finished (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We arent saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then youll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Princes online sermons!"
Thom's rating:1800-1900
"Great game Anna, but I think it is unfair for a beautiful young woman to wear a low cut blouse in a tournament."
1800
Lololol i bet showing the male opponent clevage isnt a strategy at alllll
He got lazy or drunk and made 4 moves that did nothing. I think he liked you and wanted you to win.
"she looks like anna kendrick,is that a coincidence ?"
1950
Would love to see the semi-finals. Love the format of this video.
2100
Of course we want the next one!
When the game becomes to serious like this bloke is doing i loose interest its not as if its a major tournament
1800-2k
1700-1800
... Beat me AT chess...
1900
Duh we want to see the continuation of the tourney!!!!!
CHACKMATE!!!
I love these! Can't wait for the next round
Rule number 1 dude: STOP FREAKIN' TALKING!
"Did he say ""you'll suffer"" or is that clickbait?"
He wins by intimidation. Aggressive tactics and great confidence is intimidating. But you deconstructed his position and all he had left was the hope that the clock would intervene. I thought that was a great game on your part. Fearless tactics V man of straw.
"Tom's a 1940(?). Yes, show the semifinals!"
7:41 - thing is if you take it he know what you're doing so it becomes predictable. HE's being a nice guy but there's tactics that can be used.
"So what is his rating? 1600-1800 is my guess, though the whole ""I never castle"" is quite odd. I take that as a distraction technique to throw you off and make it seem like he is not as good as he thinks."
"Work on your English prepositions, it's *at* in the title Anna"
"When does he look overconfident ? Didnt find it. Not in the beginning of the video. The guy is nice.. On the contrary you look impatient with the guy coming with a beer ""are we good to go ?"". Taking a beer in a bar seems unusual to you ?"
"I mean, did he ever even had a chance? Just asking as I am not good at chess of course..."
"16:52 ""do you mate me in 20 seconds?"" and then Anna proceeds to mate him in 5 seconds XD"
"Great job Anna! At 08:05 after Anna played the very good move c5! Tom shake the head: he seems to say: "" but finally you are better that i expected"" His queen is in dangerous aera and the bblack bishop wins the diagonale."
His mansplaining is off the hook!
nicely done with the efficient finish
"side-note, 0:37 you didnt had to exchange every chess-piece, you could just switch seats instead"
Whats greater: The chess tension or the sexual tension?!!
Tom is 1700 fide i guess
Wipes nose moves piece
Man. Tom was attracted to Anna
such a nice and enjoyable video you made :) nice game as well!
"2050 no beer, 1950 w/ beer"
First time I wanted the opponent to WIN. Seemed like a great guy
Nicely done
"Love these type of games where at some point you are kind of losing or trapped and you keep playing focus until you winwell done Anna, super well deserved win"
Can't wait to see the next one! And can't wait to see Anna reach 1mil sub!! it's all well deserved!!
"I absolutely despise this sexism frame without any evidence that this guy was behaving as you need him to to collect maximum attention. Attention, always about attention. You want to promote equality in chess, stop playing women's tournaments, stop accepting female titles. But you don't do that, because among your true peers, you're absolutely unremarkable. Perhaps that's why you wear the outfits in the videos, show as much skin as possible on your profile pic, and generally make sure you nab that physical validation in case your chess isn't noteworthy."
Chck! on B Sven! Nice Meuve! ! Great video!
Tom 1600?
He looks like pat cummins
1850
700
"If he picked up her Knight with Qxb6 than Qc2 is real strong it threatens mate and the rook, and he can't defend both. I think it actually ends up winning both rooks."
His rating is 2.
1500. We want moooore!
800
Liked the analysis. Bring on the semifinals.
We want to. See the rest
0:43 isnt that u who ur talking abt?
"when you realize anna has a spanish chess channel, hardest working chess youtuber"
"""Can you checkmate me in 20 seconds?"" Checkmates him in 5, that is mad she's rapid"
It's crazy how long the eval bar hovered around 0.0
He seems to be 1200 but no castle plumbs him to 800
What is Tom's rating
Would love to have you post PGNs of your games! Curious why no Kg4 when you started hunting for that g5 bishop...?
He was trying so super hard to pick you up it's obnoxious but sweet. If you haven't picked that up you're like that oblivious anime girls.
We have Gotham at home. Gotham at home at the one minute mark
Ive done much worse things than spill beer when I was drinking.beer on the chessboard=good day
Bxf3 sac
And that kids is how i met your mother.
1750
I think the guy without the pint would have been better
"If I was a nice guy like Tom, I'd hate someone calling me overconfident to the world online for a few clicks. Well done Tom."
"Yes, want to see the rest of the tourney. Such great stuff and fun. I really enjoyed Tom, he was awesome and great player. I would say Tom is at least 1800 minimum, but likely higher."
"Funny how you said nice purple shirt, you don't see those often. I've the exact same one and it's my favorite shirt. Mostly due purple is my favorite color. So in a way i'm like marie in BB. Anything and everything purple - joink, it's mine."
"uhh, what was his rating?"
Next round please.
Estoy celoso
His rating i think is 1850
We all know what she wanted her opening move to be.
Enjoyed the video! Great game. Your time always scares me. I hate guessing his rating with no answer? 1800ish?
Maybe 1500.
I made it all the way to the end to tell you that I have a bigger crush on you than how you would crush me at chess.
Only reason she won was cus he was distracted. he liked her.
This tournament is EXTREMELY casual!!
A bad player who was trying to woo you
"Her entire world will be shattered once she finds out the game is actually called chess, not chass"
"I always enjoy watching Anna play but this game was special because she had the gentle smile, enjoying her win before it was official. Being a parent of sins and daughters i imagine her parents liked seeing that smile even more."
"yes, we want to see the semifinals!"
Damn ur a beast
He liked her? She liked him... there was excellent first date chemistry. Tom had to ask her out! It's an only move!
he laughing to cover the embarrassment of getting fried
Tom looked like a knob....
I dont know why we were laughing and smiling so much. Its called flirting Anna.
Anna is a very attractive and kind lady and doesnt mind showing the cleavage. Id struggle staying focused for sure.
I'd say he's around 1650 FIDE strength.
"Yes Anna, let's see the next game! You are playing great!"
"Sure, show the next game. Kind of interesting."
Tom's rating is 1570
"@0:36 ""Always right!"" I'll remember that!"
I think I know why you guys were both smiling so much.
Tom1700elo rating
Spoil alert She lost I saw the stream Btw your game after that ( not in this tournament) I guess with an japonaise person it was really good I still have it could you post it and review it for me Thank you Anna
"he is smiling, because he is drunk!"
"What a rude title for your video. He came across as a polite chap, having a pint, playing a game. To not sink your pint was bad enough, the excuse was cringe but to not mention the gaff hosting you all, poor show."
hate clock chess it doesn't really show who the better player is just who thinks faster
Sure. And what is Tom's rating?
"Wait wait.."""
Tom is a 2100 player
@17:09 someone check this mans hand for fractures
YES!
His name?
it would be interesting to know how good top chess players would be in the art of war. in a war strategy game where you got tactics on any levels you could imagine and have to be completely flexible and right prepared.
"""Overconfident"" - ????"
Hes hot his id?
"As soon as you see that her beer is filled up to the top of the glass with no head, you know it's the UK."
"Anna talks pretty often about dealing with the opponent, who might be stronger or intimidating. What about Anna herself with her webcam set up to record every move?"
Happy video. Nice.
She definitely wants to be his girlfriend.
Bro in the back looks like off brand Fabi
Love the way she smiles coyly while destroying the opposition.
"the spilled beer story cracked me up! you are so cute, Anna."
"Yes, I love the fun and laughter. And youre right this is what chess is all about. Having fun. I think he is rated at 2100."
Great title
Anna read this comment! When you make a Fan meeting =) meet and greet. I living in Portugal and hope one day to meet you.
Mmm two good looking chess players laughing... What else does it take?
if this was a bullet game he would be 1200
"I looked him up, and he is 1940 British rating, and 1829 FIDE before the rating change a couple of days ago."
Tom is maybe 1700.
"yes, i would love to see the semi finals."
I think Tom wants a date
he was so smitten with you
Great game Anna.
Hannah not intimidated with beautiful guys hannah hannah
"Strange that in a tournament, even an informal one, that you would pick for colors. Do they do that every round?"
"i wonder how she would be in a real real tiem strategy game against general geniuses like total war games. if she would win one battle lol . because, yes. chess is one of the most strategic games in the world. but nothing is more strategic then a battle."
How long do these games last
"2200, but overconfident is correct. After the Queen d6 move, you were attacking he was defending. And a passed pawn on the Queenside didn't hurt."
Good stuff! And your face is in Expressen! Where it belongs! Congratulations!
Tom is arrogant & irritating
1850 maybe?
I would say 1950-2000
"You cant tell whos good at chess or not by their appearance, so its very idiotic to be overconfident when playing with a stranger"
16:54 can you mate me in 20 seconds... He lasted less than five (of Anna's clock)
So you play amateurs tournaments now ?
The lesson is never wear purple shirts
you don't know why you were laughing a smiling so much?!?!?! Really?!?!? Well let me tell you about a little thing called the birds and the bees.
"Seems very sweet and smiley, but one of the strongest..... yes Anna yes :-)! Of course we want to see the next one!"
great :)
"Well played Anna, that was gorgeous Chess!"
I have no idea what his rating is really. He plays so different than most people I play against. But maybe around 1950-2000?
"Wow, very nice win ! And commentary as good and as cristal clear as always."
1700-1800
Id say his rating was 1600
Everyone was drinking beer ? In London ?
"I mean, of course we wanna see the semifinals too <3"
Lo ms bonito del ajedrez es cuando se vive esa mezcla entre competitividad y buen rollo.
title should have been im a really snobby bitch and my opponent is a genuinly nice guy who happens to be good at chess
Here's the PGN if anyone wants to analyse it: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bg5 Be7 5. Nf3 c6 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 O-O 8. a3 a5 9. Bd3 h6 10. h4 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13. Bd3 Bb7 14.

Ur smile is also a piece
They have some chemistry
Someone has a crushhhhhh!!!
I guess it is more a sparring session for Tom and try to figure out her strengthness. How many games did you play against him afterwards?
"I went to Union Square to play against the New York City Chess masters with my shogi set. Shogi is Japanese chess. Much to my surprise, the majority of players refused to play me because it was not chess. Do any chess players here play shogi?"
"Yes, I want to see the next game."
Tom looks like he has a 900 rating amirite?
He wanted to give Anna his white bishop mmhmmm
I think he is around 1900 elo. I'd like to see your semi final
You were both laughing a lot because doh!! As easy to understand as finding out what meows on the rooftops
Hes not too good
"Really cool to see a snippet from a local tournament like this! And yeah it'd be cool to see the rest and more like it. It's sad that algorhytms require titles like this, which has relatively little to do with rather wholesome game, but hey. It is what it is."
"Tbh Tom seems kinda cocky instead of a ""great guy"" the way he tells you every move and gave statement on each position during the game. Add body language to that. But thats just me"
"Okay, but how does a phone send the signals back"
lol you could have ended him much quicker if you had just hit is f3 pawn with you bishop.
"He doesn't believe in casting, If that is true I would say 1500-1600 rating, If that is a challenge he set for himself for this game he is board with his opponents so I would say very much hier...."
At 7:20 in the background Levy and Hikaru turning the chessboard
Semifinals anyone?
"Oh he fancied you Anna, that was why he was giving you helpful tips and letting you know his thinking. And why he blushed while smiling and laughing later on. There have been a few guys who I am sure have been interested in you over the chess board in cafs in your videos, and you have been so focused on the chess you havent noticed. If you are ever lonely you can go back through your caf games and see the young men who have formed crushes on you in 10 minutes of chess. Maybe they are still playing at the same cafs."
Never castles? -.-
gut gemacht Anna!
!
1879 rating
Nicely done you deserve another
semi's
"You loved the purple shirt. Really??? Because I loved watching the game, and how you played. I really wanted to stress how much I love your videos. I'm not sure I could play anymore. But you make me watch the game again. I wish the best for you."
So Ive just downloaded chess to my PlayStation. Im totally new to chess. but theres one thing Im not quite understanding I keep getting stalemate when I think Im dominating and about to win. how do I stop this?
Scary stuff. Well done!
Semifinal! Yes please! Thank you.
Let's see the semi-final !
Tom is a solid player. Seems like a 2100 who gets a little loose when drinking lll
Tom is a 2050 I'd guess
Tom won in the end
"What's his rating? Gee, I couldn't even guess. Higher than mine, probably. I'm guessing maybe 2100. But anyway.... The real point of my comment. I think c5 was a mistake. He played Rd1 in response, but I couldn't see how you could recover if he had played Bb5 instead. You have to either move the knight or play Bc8 and then he's gonna capture the c5 pawn for free and I don't see what compensation you have there"
I don't like him. He did not take you seriously as an opponent.
"maybe tom 1500? thanks so much for making all this content, its really helpful."
yall should date ngl
Fantastic game. Good luck
"Anna: I like your purple shirt. Tom: And I like your, um, hmmm... guess I can't say it on camera."
1900
The guy was distracted by his throbbing erection.
Your game has grown immensely on the last year..
"Tom was rubbish, you were awesome. Well done."
How do you always end up with no time left xD
Never castles? I never castle. And I nearly always regret it.
Yes I want to see .
You thought he was hot. I liked his purple shirt. Haha!
"Yes, semi finals!"
1800-1900?
Guessing 1900-2000.
"Probably too late to say, ""yes"", but .... ""yes""."
Love this game
Where abouts in London is the pub?
i'm not rated... i wouldnt know
750 or 1000 ELO for him
"Of course, you're a tease. Have to see semi-finals."
"Liked very much the video, didn't like the clickbait tho, otherwise it was a nice game!"
I'm guessing Tom is an inconsistent 2100
"Yes, on next round! Plz"
1900 opponent for sure
"Erm its freezing in London right low, when was this?"
1900
Of course! We want more show us the semi-finals!
Your are in England so I would say his rating is about 5% per volume by law!
I think Anna fell in love
"Swiss Miss, your game is good but, your commentary ispriceless. You sent Tommy the Huckster packing for the hills. Either way you should have gotten the phone number of the park patzer with a pretty face, because I see a match made in heaven between you two! Lol"
"It's interesting seeing Anna with a beer, but there's a psychology regarding sport mentality, You can hit an ""alcohol peak performance."" It's about managing sleep and dealing with timing of games and pints 2,3,4 over an hour with a light pre meal you can slay people. It's mad you know, the one sport tho you dont abuse beer is chess because once drunk hits, you losing every piece"
Of course I want see it all.
Bring it on
I'm betting he's at least 2200
"If he beat 80% of players he must be +2000, but below 2800 imo"
Please the continuation!
"Yes, I would like to see the next round. You played well!"
"Maybe he can be you at English, Anna"
semi finals plz!!!
tom is 9 out of ten
I don't enjoy users who play like him. If I win or lose. Not enjoyable at all. Usually I will accept rematch from opponent I beat. But not from ones like this.
He tried really hard with his rizz but didnt work
"Very entertaining, Yes I would like to see more."
I'm guessing Tom's rating is 1800 to 1900.
Tom is probably 2000-2150 and Id love to see the semifinals
I think he lost the minute he sat down and saw her.
1500
I think tom has a Great chest board view
"did tom's rating come out yet? I'm guessing 1600. aggressive critical moves without calculation, nonexistent time management, moving right into a pawn fork, not castling..."
Could we have some more please?
I really enjoyed the vid ty
it this game Tom played like a 1575 Fide at best and you like a 2000 Fide ;)
"17:40 ""and I loved his purple shirt, u dont see purple shirts everyday"""
"Looks like a very fun tournament, definitely cover the rest of the games. I would guess his strength at around 1900 to 2000."
yo puedo vencerte dandote besos apasionados
"YESSSSSSSSS! Way to go, Anna! I'm learning a lot watching your games, while enjoying your good sense of humor!"
"Silly little Swede! Of course, we want to see all of your matches, kid!"
dont drink and play...
"So what you showed is that you are a very good player, so when you hear someone wins 80% of the time at a public tournament you should remember that you win 90+%. Stay Confident Anna, it has been exciting to see you dynamically improve and your energy is always great."
1600 or 1800 ?
Great game.
Yes would enjoy watching your next video
Well played!
ha ha ha the newest horror of 2024 watch an enjoy anna
Rest of the tournament please :D
SHOW THE SEMI-FINALS!!!...YES:)
Ive played cow opening 3 times annd won 3 times in a row
"105k views in less than 24 hours, anna blew up quick."
"I really enjoy this format where you commentate after on a ten minute-ish game. There's enough time to really see what's happening and hear your strategies. Hard to tell his rating, He was too aggressive here and hurt himself. If he's normally more temperate he could be quite high. I am guessing 2200 or so"
"Anna, the best way to avoid spilling your beer is to drink it!"
"Love the commentary, I watch you a lot, but cant process your games that fast."
I really enjoyed watching Tom's overconfidence and mindgames falter to your superior skill.
Sorry but Tom comes across as being a bit of a smart arse and only exists in his bubble of lower ranked players
I thought he would get hit with the cow
1500 maximum
How did I know he was British from the thumbnail
Where is this club in London?
You dress like a whore
I need the continuation of the tournament
"Yes, of course we want to c it Anna. Who wouldnt?"
"Of course, we want to see more games from you. He was a bit cocky but you nailed him. I'm learning a lot from you"
his rating must be like 1900
1950
Anna playing in London....Fee fi fo Fum I smell the blood of an English mon....Somebody sold him some magic beans. He should of played the cow. Jack and the beanstalk was published in London in the 1700;s Just thought you might like to know...lol
Any chance to see you in Manchester?
"Hi. Why are you not playing chess in Prague? Miss you see you with Andrea, Alexandra and Dina"
He let you win I learnt master chess in 8 months Grandmaster 4 and a half months and champion chess engine they know every possible combination of moves and don't forget them with no human errors he could probably play human chess
"Can't wait to see the semifinals. You are playing your best chess and the field better watch out for ANNA. Hit them with the COW, Chess Princess."
"I don't know enough to guess his rating, but yes! More please!"
I'm from Southsea which is the last place in England before you crash into the Isle-of-Wight.
I'm encouraged by watching you play although I become anxious as your clock runs down and you leave yourself with only a few seconds to complete a winning sequence. Nevertheless I enjoy following your progress. I wish you well.
"I know nothing of chess, but I do know a bit about people in bars. So, if you watch this video without sound and observe both players, I get the vibe that the chess here is secondary at least for Tom. And honestly even more so since the pay out is a bottle of wine."
1600 just to get through the opening. Probably 1800 to get through the midgame. The beer and the flirting probably account for the blunders. I'm guessing 1950+.
He's around 1897
"I know I would lose, but I also know I would confuse you."
around 1800-1900 would be my guess
Tom plays like an 1800-1900. Only going for tactics instead of trying to improve your position...
Awesome game! I'm so proud of you Anna!
"en alguna parte del video retiraste la cerveza, jaja, yo tambien me la habria bebido."
I think he may be 1400
Please upload the semis:)
He is so cocky
"He's probably 1650, he's good but he hung his knight and his bishop and didn't take your knight on b6."
Anna beat him by flirting. Very sneaky.
"Great game,well played!!"
Tom : 1800 + alcohol = 1500
The title is so misleading. He seems supercute and nice
Anna usually really like your videos. But your editor is ruining this one for me. Positive criticism. Do not use melancholic orchestra on happy chess games. Without music or if music something calm chess but with element of backing joy of chess. Hope you see this and show it to your editor. He usually does a fine job.
He is your type
Everyone: hold my beer Anna: spill my beer Everyone at the chess club:
next round please from the Philippines
You're great teacher Anna whether you win or lose
tom is 1800-2000 blitz?
In this game you were the daughter of Juan Manuel Belln Lpez
"Very nice win Anna...looked like you two were flirting a bit there, am I right? lol"
1:06 Peter Svidler and Levy playing in the background
Tom's rating 1850 to 1900
Great game ! That was awesome ! 1500 ? He was using all his best anecdotes and silly distractions but to no avail.. Maybe play a bit faster. Hahaha clock ! CLOCK ! lol Love ya work Anna ! Of course next game. Interesting music ?
Why are you so full of yourself?
"his rating? 1500ish ,since he can't play positional stuff."
"congrats you had me rolling all over the floor what a fun game! gosh, how often do folks laugh out loud over a chess match?"
Well done
+1 semi-finals
Cant decide what clock to buy need a new one and really cant find info on what one is the best right now.
Brilliant play.
"i m new to chess, love watching you play your always having a lot of fun"
I believe Tom is around 1850 rating.
"Way too much fun Anna, dame mas vaca !!"
OF COURSE WE WANT THE NEXT ROUND
"""This was Tom..."" , ""was Tom"", "" _was_ "" - Has anyone seen Tom since???"
I'd peg him at about 1700-1800
"Yes, more please!"
Earth is flat.
My guess for Tom is 1705
Hes a great match for you.
"Yes, please. I would love to see more of this tournament. Good game, Anna!"
@ 0:43 This WAS Tom meanwhile me wondering Was? whats gonna happen to Tom
Very nicely done.
I love your enthusiasm and discussions of strategy!!!
2000 for Tom?
"At some point, he should have castled, then 2 castles firing together is much more powerful than any 2 pieces of the board together. Tom seems to play against himself, playing both sides of the board, thats why he kept offering advice to you along the way. Some player trains by playing both sides...detrimental to one's mental health, dont try it"
so are you guys dating now or what
"I really enjoyed this game, Anna. Your commentary was very entertaining, i.e. I didn't have the mute the game. Thank you."
"Tom's rating is probably 1500. Next round, please. That was a well played endgame and fantastic result."
I bet Tom was 2200 IM
Well done.
Basic gimmick player. NEVER castles? Thats just foolish.
Hes 2100?
I think Tom is about 1600 fide
Go Anna
Sacrificed... THE ROOK
"Yes Yes Yes Semi Finals Please Anna a brilliant game, as you remained super focused, well done. Plus a great video, clever editing, and voice over, all fun, thank you"
You Chuckmated him good
Does drinking beer help become a GM?
You do better in a ten-minute game. Play more of those and your followers won't suffer as much watching you move too slowly.
But he's handsome and hot
maybe he is rated 1700
Heck yes we want to see the next match!
Semi finals please. Thank you so much for this fun side of chess.
Please show the continuation of the tournament
There was a lot of chemistry between them! Thats why they were both laughing
"Hello Anna, you have a wonderful personality and a wonderful smile where I wish I could put it in my pocket and carry it with me everywhere. Your smile is worth 1000 words, God bless you. Today I walked into a bank and made a small deposit and one of the ladies in her office had a sign that said, be polite. So, I walked into the office and said hi to this stranger and she was a little surprised, i said, God bless you and then I told her that I read her sign that said be polite. You know what I did next, I got into my Jeep and headed towards a thrift store and before I got there, there were these two guys waving their jumper cables at me. At first, I just thought they were just trying to be funny, but then I realized that they needed help for their battery was dead in their car. So, I felt blessed today that I was able to help a couple people for the Lord is like that or he sent me a spirit and help guide me to help make a difference in a couple people's lives within just a 10-minute time period. so, I hope Anna that you never change that wonderful smile of yours. I just love it and love you."
"Anna, I, personally, want to see a tournament where you always start with ""the cow"""
I would fuess he is about 1600 rtg
We NEED to see the rest of the tournament.
1800
Good Game! You should be proud! Yes I want to see the other games.
"The voice over videos are the best, i am here waiting for semifinal"
Anna is so focused on the chess that she is unaware that she is beautiful and men will try to flirt with her. I think Tom's rating is 2k.
All these chess nerds want to castle anna
"That was fun! Yes, semifinals, please!"
"Great victory, Anna! And a really nice commentary."
Bring on the Semis...go get em.
Lets go! Very cool tourney. Would like to play. Lets see how it goes!
Anna: I noticed that at the end of the game Tom's beer glass was empty while yours was full! Smart move putting your glass on the ground where it was harder to reach! And you were not even distracted by his purple shirt! Well done!!
Donald Trump is God
Let's go!
i think his rating is 16
POST THE SEMIFINALS
That was excellent! Show us the next one!
he didnt seem over confident
I think Tom is maybe 1800. I haven't played a human in years and I believe I could have won that game.
Excellent recap! You played a solid game. So. what was his rating? I would guess something like 1400.
awesome
1800?
Anna this format... pub/club games narrated by you in the edit... is sooooo good... keep doing it!
Please fall inLOVE
It 's pretty obvious Tom likes you.
I play worse chess when drinking. How do you do it?
"Is it just me, or maybe Tom and Anna were smiling because they were actively flirting. There was more active flirting than the LSB after Anna played c5"
My guess at Toms rating is right around 2000
"He's in to you and your in to him!!! He tried Honey potting you then, he gave in cuz he likes you, and then he submit to your Black-widow square control!!!..!! I would like to see you two play again but for who is better !!!!(find a room, then play for real!) ;)"
Yes!
6:48 I've never felt such kinship with a bishop before.
His rating is 1800 and yes we want to see a continuation all the way to the finals
"get his contact, what great chemistry you both have!"
"When you win, Anna, I'm all smiles."
Your chess(t) distracts me from watching chess. Stop it Anna
"What do you mean ""let me know if you want to see the semi finals"" Of course we do. Upload it NOW!"
"yes, I want to see continuation. He was blushing playing against you. Great game Anna"
Love this form!!!!!!
"Yess, more chess!"
"Hey Anna, well done!!! yes please, show all your games & the rest of this Tourney ."
Of course we want to see the semifinals. Great game and commentary. Great play at the beginning to get out of that trap.
"I'm no chess expert and I don't know much about ratings other than what Anna has talked about in some of her previous matches. I would say that it is impossible to know what Tom's rating is because he's been drinking beer and he is over the moon with Anna, and we don't know how much beer he has consumed. Nonetheless, since Anna has said other have said he wins 80% of his matches and he is really good, I would say 2100"
"Yes, the next game in this tournament, please. That was a pleasant game. PS -- your pint looked tastier than his pint."
Am I the only one that kind of ships Tom and Anna?
You never told us his rating
And the moral of the story...don't cry over spilled beer. :}
When he moved p-f3 at 14:03 I was hoping you'd play Bxf3. I think that would have been a quicker and more efficient way to end it.
Just finished the video. I'm so glad that you didn't let his overconfidence and mind games of trying to tell his moves and making move suggestions for you throw you off your own game. He ended up a sitting duck by keeping his king in the middle unprepared for your tactical moves.
"His attitude exudes ""boy will show girl how it is done"". Great to see Anna win this. Keep going Anna!!"
Thank you ! Great game Of course wed like to see the next game Hope you win. You GO GRRL!
Next round would be great. Well done Anna.
I'm at the point you asked to guess Tom's rating. I'm guessing 1700.
"2076, and did you get Tom's #?"
"Looks and sounds a bit like Tom Daley the diver, just a bit. Rating no idea I don't play chess, just played a couple of games with brother when I was young. Keep smiling"
Tom talks too much like 1800 rank player.
Good job. Hope to see you win it.
Yes continue
Yes
The beer is making him laugh.
I didnt know Anna was old enough to drink.
"Know whats also funny, you never moved that white bishop after all that thinking about it! : )"
1800?
"I only knock beers over if I am losing and I make sure the clock goes off the table for a reset!! Of course we are all following you and want to know, love to your parents."
He may have underestimated your skills!
They would make a cute couple.
I think his rating is 1850
1700
he is prob 1600
"Anna, du r helt fantastisk. Inte bara i ditt schackspel, utan nr man ser dig spela, du gr alla glada runt omkring dig. Du verkligen visar varfr man spelar schack p detta sttet. Fr att ha kul, fr att vara social och fr att ha en liten stund med en frmling och gra dem glada."
Annathank you for these videos. I really think you and your team have really perfected these 10m rapid games. The inner monologue and the pensive musicwith a really satisfying mix of strategy and personality. Its great.
Yes we want to see! Good luck Anna!
Need to see you win the wine!
Guessing his rating was around 2000. Please share what his rating is!
No way Tom was more than 1800...at least what he showed in this game. You crushed him like a bug on the windshield
Thanks and looking forward to the next game.
We want to see the semifinal too
Enjoyable game to watch. Bring on the semi final please!
"No!!!! Don't show us the next round. Just kidding. Asking us if we want to see the next round is you just click baiting us to get more points on the YouTube algorithm, and I am happy to oblige."
1800
Ohkiss already That was a fun one to watch.
I think he was 1900
"I think Tom's rating is about 2000, and yeah would love to see more vids from this tournament. Amazing game!! Well done you two =)"
play more like this!
It's called flirting Anna
I enjoyed this very much.
Round 2 dude looked like Wesley So :P
Please give us the rest of the tournament!
"Given his opponent, Tom began to think with his schlong instead of his brain, which ultimately led to his defeat!"
His rating 1600
"Yes, please Anna."
Keep it coming
"Anna is FIDE 2100, so pretty strong. My guess his opponent is ca 1700, amateur club level player, he made lot of mistakes , both tactical and strategic."
drinking a pint of bitter makes you a champion player
Tom must have been distracted because he ditched any plan after six moves .
"Good job Anna. I also loved his purple shirt. Anna is just a good person, no ego or gloating and great to watch. Good to see her trusting herself and making her moves after considering the crowd and the questions she had about her opponents behavior / moves. Good video and win Anna."
"Oh, your best CHESS."
"Tom got schooled by young Anna. Anna subtly but brilliantly taught Tom some lessons that he probably won't ever learn. Anna, you are a gift to the people and sorry Tom but you're a douche. Weren't able to flag her, I guess. Anna is a much nicer person than I but she did destroy him but in a kind and gentle way. Good job Anna. You're the best!"
1699 rating.
"when she says, This WAS Tom. I had a feeling about what whats coming."
Looks like loooooove....
If the next round is the cute guy in the gray shirt then YES!...Oops....its a blue shirt.
Next round please.
"castling is for losers! or is it the other way round? yes, want to see the next round."
Upload the continuation please!
Of course Id like to see the tournament its so much fun watching you have fun.
bah..I was hoping that Anna would have played the Grunfeld when I saw the opening. I have been learning it and wanted to see it. I was using Shredder to analyze the game and the c5 move was the best move but it had a positive evaluation of .15 for white. The rook move was not the best one. He should have moved the bishop to bb5. Your knight move was best. Capturing the pawn after he played the knight move was best as this left the evaluation as 1.17 in favor of Black. I would like to see the rest of the games until the conclusion.
Why would you even ask if we want to see the continuation? Of course!!
We shook hands
Hahaha Anna is low key tough. Her comments are so kind but so aggressive
Anna out here translating English into English for us
So intense
Definitely show more. Nice win
1700 maybe?
hes a good 2000 elo
"Wow! Epic game! It was awesome watching how that played out, how you managed to ignore all his 'advice', turn the tide and finally bring in the cat! I was *glued* to this one!!! :D Loving this tournament!!"
Of course we want to see the semi final!
You shook hands. Shooook not shaked
:) :) :) :) :) :)
blir glad nr du slr ngon som kaxar s!!
There's some magic in people giggling and having a laugh over a chess board. Don't know what it is. It's nice :)
Excellent game. Funny how Anna only sips her beer twice while her opponent drained the entire pint XD
"His rating was?! Dont leave is with that type of cliffhanger, Anna! (I really dont hink he had more than 1700-1900.) Need to know. Tell us!"
"Love your channel! For future reference, say We shook hands instead of We shaked hands"
Very entertaining. And impressive Yes let's see the finals too please.
"Well, what is his rating? You didn't tell."
16:10 I will guess... 2170.
"I think Tom's rating is about 1800, maybe 1900. You are much better than him, and this game demonstrated that."
He is very hard to rate based on this one game and the refusal to castle and no defense or position. If you are putting all your eggs in one basket and going tactical - then you have to be one red-hot tactician :)
I would definitely like to see the next game. Following you in tournaments are the videos I like most.
"Next, please!!!!"
"So, when are you getting married?"
Tom 1690
please show all the matches please. thanks bye
never forget to drink your beer when playing chess lol
Tom should be around 1250-1450. I think much more is assuming too much with the info I've got.
I love this content!
i think tom is 1700/ish to 1950. on a good. anna you are the nicest chess player in the world
"No, No - Don't leave us hanging. More!"
17:39 the 2 guys next to them look like the Wish version of Hikaru and Levy
"Great game, Anna! Definitely keep showing the rest of this tournamentIm on the edge of my seat."
Your early castle almost pinned you.
2120
guess at Tom's rating: 2000
he's 1800.
Of course I want to see the next one!
Of course. Let's see the next round!
"Semifinals? Yes, please!"
Yesss make the semi final
"Anna you should have thrown the Beer into his face and said: "" - Die you chessy bastard, die!"" ;) ;) ;)"
His rating is between 1650 and 1750.
"Hmm, he might be 1500-1600 Fide. But he could be better at blitz."
1400
i NEED the next round with the button up shirt guy
"dang didn't know you were in London! this is fantastic, casual bar chess it the best please upload more."
17:58 This guy is pretty dreamy looking. Was he also a solid player?
1800. Or did you mean looks on a scale of 1-10?
Sjlvklart
"I'll guess Tom's rating is 2200. Please show the rest of the tournament--at least the rest of your games, Anna. Great video and commentary. I'm happy you told the viewers what Tome was saying to you because I couldn't understand him."
I'd put Tom's ELO at 1900.
"Can we get this with Sound on cause it sounds like fun converstation, he also sounds and looks a little like a British Prince charming"
"I hear you say shaked hand, but is shook. Haha np"
STOP TALKING
Well played
Yes please do the semifinals (and finals!).
"Yes, the semi final, please."
I'm really not good at chess about @4:30 couldn't have tried a king stun with his bishop and queen?
I'm all shook up.
More! :)
"""I've done that before!"", so thoughtful."
I'd think maybe 1800?
A new born baby could beat you at chess. That or a rock could beat you.
Chess is 99% tactics!
I am glad I tune in. I would have fall for the opening P x B trap. Tom 's rating most likely 1800 to 2000.
Re simpatico
Congratulations Anna!!! Awesome checkmate!!! Would love to see more of your tournament!
You two look good together. And definitely we want to see the sequel.
At 16:10... Tom's rating 2100
Beautiful!
"Yes, please! This was a pleasant game to watch."
semi-final :)
1800 rating
sure show the next round ! But drink a glass of wine during the game instead of beer. Show the Brits a little class.
"He underestimated you, then you CRUSHED him!!"
Next video please.
"100% want to watch the rest...I am loving this tournament coverage, Anna!"
I think Tom's rating is 1750 at the point you asked.
"Very well-played game, Anna! Not that I would know given I'm nowhere near your rating! LOL"
I feel a lot of chemistry between you two hihihi
My Guess is Tom's rating is 2000
"I'd guess Tom was 2050-2075. He probably beats a lot of players using opening traps or midgame tactics, but your long-range tactical advantage was able to see what he was up to and defuse the attacks and create a solid and unstoppable counterattack."
He was just intimidated by you Anna Great game!
"He was more nervous playing Anna than vice versa, I believe it cost him this game :-)"
Ok. I gave up . What is his rating?
"""Seemed very sweet and very smiley and happy was the strongest people at that"" sounds familiar: You Anna The guy has Good vibes he looks kind and funny but I really don't like that he was understimating you, maybe mansplainning, he just crushed the reality"
Great game and great win Anna!
He's Fide 1500. Maybe 1600 max.
I wanna see the one where you spill the beer Anna.
"Next round, please!"
I wish you only commentated when you aren't talking to your opponent because the dialog between you and your opponents are very fun to listen to.
"Definitely want to see the semi-finals. Also hoping that you'll use more fantastic lines like ""everyone was smiling and I was smiling too but I was smiling cause I was winning"""
"What does it mean to ""get flagged""?"
1800??
Love
Boy got schooled
"What he's actually thinking.. ""OH God! I like her! I can't ask her out unless I win!! """
Lovely top. Captivating beauty
Based on his stats of winning 8/10 games there on average I would say between 2000 and 2100 so 2050 is my guess
I think he's about 1650 elo
his rating at 16:10 is 2000.
Awesome!!!!!! please show the semi finals!!!
"My eyes where on the price, I'm not saying this twice"
"his rating,1234"
Love your videos. It seems your only enemy is the clock.
I really loved the narration on the moves and your thinking. Thanks Anna.
"super game, i think i can play drew with anna"
"Congrats, Anna Gonna guess Tom iz about 1900 (?).."
2400
Mansplaining
He paused because you kicked his bishop! Early activity confused him hehe.
Well done!!!!!
"As nice of a guy Tom was, I was totally hating him at the moment of your playing close with. I hated Tom. Now you won so I like him again. You should probably go and date him and have many babies and name them Anna, the boys and girls and live happily ever after. Or the other option you can just have just another beer and win the next game. Onto the next round. Babey!"
"amazing game, but what's with off brand levy and rip off hikaru in the background?"
Mmm Hmmm. You two were smiling at each other. lol So was there a date after this? I'm guessing he's around 1850
"Well played Anna. In time trouble, she held her game together and scored the win."
"A great game, yes of COURSE I want to see the semifinals. GO Anna!"
Netflix has ruined my ability to patiently wait for content. I want to binge watch everything. I can't wait to see how the rest of this tournament went. I love these types of videos that you do. Please keep them coming.
1800
"13:24 Why not throwing in an intermediate rook lift? Defend you pawn and knight, and still thretening to take his bishop?"
Why the hell is Tom laughing so much?
Anna is such an adorable chess nerd
"12:57 His ONLY option was Rd2 because Qxf2 was checkmate, or he was losing a bishop. He had to put pressure on your Queen. There was no other option."
"Andrea just choked in Round 3. She had a guaranteed draw, went for win, and lost because she didn't exchange Queens soon enough. Otto played great too. Alex won though"
Cow opening in the final!
Cmon. We all know why you two where giggeling. Sweet chemistry.
"Go on, go on, with this tournament! And please show us the spilled beer!"
Round 4 please
1970
"Congratulations Anna, so proud of you!"
1750
"Woo Hoo, Anna!"
Semifinal Pls !
Overconfident Guy Thinks He Can Beat Me In Chess Click Bate
"I always have a pint at my chess club, it improves elo right!"
I love this so much!! And I love Tom's playstyle with all the tactics These games are much better than the positional chess ones wish more people would play like this xD
Omg this is intense. Almost as good as your other tournaments; except the prize is better-alcohol! Lol
Yes please Anna
"Hola!! From Panama city,Panama."
16.1s nice!
yes
My nice (edit: I mean niece) is Spanish
"Yes, more please."
He thought you were easy pickings...lesson learned. The rest of the tournament please.
GOOD GAME!
Not coffee?????
Welp might as well hand Anna the finals win then. This is insane
Next round! :)
Congrats Great game Anna I think he's 2200 !... Keep up the amazing work kind regards Worrell from London
Vine por el canalillo/escote
16:08 1850
Tom is a solid 2000
"Please keep the live audio if there is some, it's so much better!"
Please put up the rest of the games.
Yes please
I'd say 2150
"We would have good matches if we played against each other. I've been beating most people I play against since I was about 9. I've gotten worse as i've gotten older, but I could still challenge you. ;) Play me."
"Great game, Anna! Waiting for the next ones..."
1600 elo
"chess doesnt make you laugh and smile that much, it's beers"
"Yes, I'd like to see the completion of that tournament."
Can you mate me in 20 seconds? * Done by 16.
He struck me as a smug mansplaining pain! rating: 1800?
My guess at Tom's rating: 1800
"Congratulations , Anna We sure want to see the continuation of the games !"
Bring on the semi-finals!
1800
It seems a little bit that theres something in the air Two beautiful young players
I'd say Tom was rated around 1800.
sexxxxxy Tom
Congratulations: you created tension like in a thriller movie...
Lets go!
Can we see more of tournament please
I'm going to London
beautuful vibes
Well done lady Anna ; Next round please :)
More beer 1600 yes show the rest.
"i think he is around 2000, because he plays risky and playful, fun game!"
"I would like to see the semifinals, Ann. Great Game"
I thought that nigga behind her was levy
Nice game. I would rate him around 1900 or so.
What was his rating?
This guy is annoying.
the guy looks so un-friendly and pissed but trying to hide it behind a fake smile
*ANTI SPOILER BARRIER*
Show the full tournament. Let's go: semi-finals!
Wholesome!
Awesome game!!! May the force be with you Anna. Love always.
My guess of his elo is 1400
Please post your next game in this tournament! I cant wait!
What a loser. First he downtalks you bc you're a woman and later he blames it on his risky moves. I don't understand why you have sympathy for him
Anna is the best
"I like it when you are intimidated by your opponent, because that's when you seem to usually win. I think he underestimated you and paid for it. What is his rating?"
let's go!
Guessing his rating is in the 1800s
he is a faar better player than his rating would have u believe.cause he plays to trip u up not necessarily to win
WOW!! What a great video. Thank you for not telling at the beginning who will win
then i inhaled some air and then i exhaled some air
Is it the place in Elephant & Castle?
'Overconfident' is a bit harsh. Seems like a nice chap!
"Great win; that was a well executed ""eye of the tiger"". More Please! FREE"
The thing in this game is that he drank his beer and Anna didn't
Great match. Thanks Anna! Would like to see all your matches.
"YESSSSSS, Anna for the win!!!!"
I think he is 700 elo.
Tom is noob
"""The public was smiling, Tom was smiling, I was smiling... but I was smiling cuz I was winning!!!"" LMAO! Absolute perfect quote."
I think Tom is 1700
Lets see the next round!!!!
It's always Anna against the clock somehow.
Yes! Love when u win
Offcourse we want to see the semi :-)
1800
"1700 for tom is my guess. who ""never castles""?! wtf"
Continue toe tournament if you can. Thanks
Thanks!
5:48 Wholesome moment on the table in the background as the lady with the white pieces wins her game.
All these comments about the game but nobody saw levy playing in the background
14:03 He didn't took the knight because I think you had some Rook sacrifice on f2
2500
Underestimated his Grand opponent and lost control of the board. Doesn't believe in casting was his second mistake which cost him greatly!
"It always puts a smile to my face when some dude with misplaced confidence gets put in his place, nice job!"
What a game! Great job
I guess his rating is about 2250. Would love to see the semi-final and of course the final too.
"After watching the whole video, I hope he got your number. You two would make a great couple. Reminded me of the video with your mom & dad. Similar chemistry."
"Anna, stop letting your time get so low. My nerves can't handle it! :)"
Drinking beer with Anna--that's a good time. I'd love to drink beer with Anna and see if I can last more than 30 moves before she beats me.
1900
I really want to play his opening as white against my 1200 rated opponents...
"Yes, lets see the semi final with the analytics. No clue as to Tom's rating as I'm just a beginner."
Yes.
"Between 1800 and 2000. He knows basic tactics, does not blunder too much, but he plays way too reckless."
GG
His rating - maybe 1800?
When's the next date? I noticed some chemistry.
Great game Anna. Next round please.
"Great game, Anna. Your experience of playing under time pressure really helped you here."
"""He started telling me what to do, but I'm a strong independent woman don't need no man"""
putting your glass next to your clock is a horrible idea. ... how are you supposed to drink while you play?
Hallo Ana about your?think that Tom maby 1800elo !!but you know something baby i to am a player...if you ona play a chess party tel me please Ana Im in Lisboa Portugal and i would travel all the world arround just to be in time 4a Party with... greeatings and congratulations an Lady Pia
Looking forward to seeing the next game.
He sacrificed THE ROOOOOOOOOOOK!!!!!
@Anna What rating is he?
"I'd give Tom 1950, Yes please show the finals."
1300 rating
was he 1800
Whoop his ass Anna!
Of course we want to see it!
"Anna won in the best style, with her elegant smile intact. My wishes from heart Anna, someday you will be a chess women champion"
".....I don't understand... you kept saying you had so and so much time left, but it didn't match the time clock...? I don't know a thing about chess, even when you explain what you're doing - it's hard to follow - but it definitely makes it more interesting. It's weird how you often talk back and forth with your opponents during the games - you must have such incredible abilities to keep track of the pieces on the board and all the possibilities AND chatter about nonsense. It's just really incredible. Try not to spill any more beers, though."
To play your SF against the guy who has been playing alongside you in a few of your matches already! haha
Amazing game! Cant wait for the semi!
"I'm guessing that because you keep saying the winning prize was either a bottle of wine or champagne, you didn't eventually win the tournament?"
"I almost went to the London Knights club a couple of weeks ago! Looks like a great venue, greetings from France!"
Yes more!! Bar chess is the best
"I don't know why, but I was smiling watching this whole game. I had a feeling it would end this way and that made me very happy. LOL"
How in the world are all these chess nerds so good looking?!
"Appreciate the effort you put into your content, it radiates passion and genuine commitment."
Everyone was smiling and I was smiling but I was smiling cuz I was winning.
I think his rating is 2300
The GM of Beauty was never in any danger.
"After I watched the Cow get obliterated, confidence soars"
You two seem cute together.
Deberas hacer ms videos como estos pero en espaol!! Saludos.
"At 2:55 that background music is so good, WHATS THE NAME OF SONG? Please"
1867
1800
It's obvious to me that he likes you. That's why he was keeping up the banter. That's what guys do when they are nervous around an attractive woman.
My guess on Tom's rating? Hmm... 2100? Am I even close?
Flirt tactical bluff opening deployed!
"""Everyone was drinking beer"" Welcome to the UK..."
Awhhh. Relieve is pronounced re-leave not re-live. Your English is cute.
Woooooooooooo congratulations!
Nobody else could beat you. You're just too good at what you do.
It's crazy how equal this game was in the ELO bar!! WOW
Little did he know he was playing a GM in the making...
Keep doing what your doing anna
Anna
You need to win that wine Anna!!
Hello
Anna it is we SHOOK hands. You say it wrong every time. Your English is flawless apart from this one tiny thing
Hi from ontario canada Anna....The cow is no bull! (in canada no bull means its not bull sh##).. Your score is higher but ur age is lower does that sound like a good match?
Do you EVER get the white pieces?
first comment!!
First
She wins. Great checkmate.
3 months later Im still watching it every other week. Fire! Actually. MUSTER! Lol
"1:12 he took another jab at the big 3 ""Remember i told im the greatest back when you debated the no.1 and no. 2"""
I wish i csn like this a million times
Wack asf
I'm back again.
He was locked in fr
Whos still here in 2025?
I have never watched a halftime show more than once I've watched this one at least 20 times now
Starting at 10:00
10:53
I'm even more impressed that the cameramen were able to keep up!!
"Kendrick really owned the whole stage!! It was a crazy, unforgettable performance. He's the G.O.A.T"
"This performance was layered, meaningful, and masterfully executed. The way he blends powerful messages with stunning visuals is nothing short of iconic."
Back again
"who is the girl singing ""luther"""
100
Drake is crying
Voz irritante parece que t gritando com voz fina
"""I recognize your false confidence, promises, all in your conversations."" That's how you called out the fake ones"
Every week watch!
Anyone 2090 ??
Best half time show Ive ever seen. About time we have something patriotic instead of devil worship.
8:40 WAKANDA FOREVERRRR
who is here after el clasico 4/3
12:50 MustardDddddddddddd
"Evy time I see this vid, I feel tears well up inside! WHO says our tribe cant stick together ???? THAT DAY, Kevin BROUGHT THE TRIBE AND GLUE TOGETHER"
"I was feeling a little down, so I came back here and 13:21 later things are looking up. Then I opened the comments, realized I'm not alone, and all was well again."
May 11th still top
This kind of turned into the 2025 USA Anthem to all those that know.
Like you Kendrick
Made that boy turn his tv off
Here again
"Kendrick looked so happy looking at the camera during, hey Drake, I heard ya like em young"
favorite video on YouTube
Man that was fire
Can som3one tell me the song he does after DNA
Love it
The best part is euphoria!
I will keep watching this till Im 100 years old
Im here fo peakaboo Choreography
kendrick the diisser i like your halftimes and love the NFL
Drake: where ya uncle at? And Kendrick brought Uncle Sam at the NFL
Can't stop coming in again
still watching
Bro if u was drake i wouldve died you know
I find it apropos that Uncle Sam stated Ken lost his mind by not performing the the drama inducing song the ladies wanted to hear as our government loves to use such things as a distraction. This represents Kendrick not being a government tool as a distraction. Waiting to make his point l. This shows that even the government is a part. Of the pedophilic problem with modern society. They want only their enemies to be pointed out but deal their allies like Ashton Kutcher Mila Kunis being called out.
Ainda no superei!
Welp back again
Lol
10:19
"When I first heart that LM was doing the halftime, I was like ""meh."" Me on super bowl night....""Let me hear you say mustard........!!!!!!!"" It was awesome!"
Back again
imagine if it was super bowl 69 not 59
time to repeat
Bro did that all in front of Drake
Still listening and watching congratulations Kendrick Lamar
Samuel L Jackson is in almost every movie including Star Wars and now the super bowl
Rap Goat
"Historical life time show, only devil's got made and don't understand"
Its criminal they took sams intro out. Says alot

Heyy
Who's still here in 2025?
The real MVP of the SB was the cameraman
It's crazy how this performance still feel like it's live even 3 months later. Kendrick the G.O.A.T!
O jeito que ele humilha o Drake ganhando Grammys e fazendo essa apresentao no Super Bowl algo que vai ficar para a histria.
"HE THAT HATH EARS TO HEAR AND UNDERSTAND The BIBLE MATH. THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS = THE CHILDREN OF THE EAST = (Book of Judges 6:3)(opposed Israel) GREAT SPHINX OF GIZA *** = (Leviathan) WHO WAS KING CHARLES 1 = (Leviathan)(Job 41:1) KINGS OF THE GENTILES = (St. Luke 22:25) ARMOUR BEARER OF HIRAM = CERTAIN OF THE SADDUCEES = (St. Luke 20:27)(body hackers) WHO IS USING HEXES = (1 Samuel 15:23)(rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft) WHO IS ROSE ARMITAGE *** = (Get Out, putting people in Sunken Place)(Ezekiel 18:23) 205 + 106 = 311"
I want to be the one sitting on the lamp post.
10:17
"At around 5:23, he used ""Bum"" from like at the end of Euphoria. I just caught that"
11:54 he ate DOWN i must say
May 2025
"The whole half-time show was spectacular! I don't know any of the entertainers personally but I was (and still am) proud of Kendrick Lamar, Sza, and the team of dancers after watching this show."
What is the first song
this super bowl performance is underrated. i enjoyed every single minute of it knowing my Eagles were stomping the Chiefs well before & up to this point!
I can't stop watching this.
"This is ART ...every time I watch, so impressed by the beauty of it."

I don't even listen to rap and I've watched this video a dozen times so far.
Kendrick was so angry at drake that is why he performed this song
Im still here..
"Can't forget the iconic CERTIFIED LOVER BOY, CERTIFIED PED-PHILEEE!! HECK YEAHH!!"
For some reason I came back here after the news of the first pope from the USA
Back again. It will never get old.
Yes back again
"If anyone has a good ear for music, u can tell they definitely mixed it up again. One to me the music more balanced Second to make SZA voice airy. I like it, but it was better before. I dont mind it though"
Shakira y Jlo mejor show de la historia
Came here to collect more memories for the after life.
"This is amazing man, the creativity, the flow, the performance"

Con que poco talento se emociona el humano con poca cultura.
This Super Bowl halftime show was definitely for the blacks but watch next year. Theyll be a rock band and theyll be some sort of remark saying how the NFLs racist for not hosting a hip-hop artist again.

SZA and Kendrick Lamar going north to see where yall are coming The halftime show apple
That Reagal is one of a kind
I just realized that the whole point of him saying turn his tv off (with a smile) at the end was meant for Drake and what he would have to do as he watched this halftime show.
3:43 They all eating these faces

"Say what you want....When America has to fight its war with Russia and China, Black people are going to be the ones signing up $100k a year to fight (because a DRAFT will cost more than $100k per person to enforce. Even Russia cant do the draft, they are 100% volunteer paid. You get drafted by your financial situation basically, people are kinda forced to go to war to get paid, peer pressure. Unemployed men become a way to get paid by the state. Its starship troopers"
"""Have you ever fought a war with a near peer enemy?"""
His legs are legging
jkr4
he smiled when he said say drake
Kendrick is surely another reincarnation of eminem no doubt.
10:03
Super.
He covered more yards during euphoria than KC did in the whole game

That Game Over signaled the end of the Drake vs Kendrick Beef
FINALLY we have the CORRECT Person to lead the RAP/HIP HOP genre!!! When the time comes he will hand the crown to the next king. Thank you Kendrick!!!

"I don't see a lot of people mentioning how past Super Bowl Halftime shows capitalize on the artist's hits. Kendrick opened up his show with an unreleased song that we don't even have official lyrics for!! He's doing it his own way no matter what. For months, people have been trying desperately to rewrite the narrative."
Back again
Not like US!
I think it was really really really good. I keep listening to it and over and over.
12:19
Try to get me fired from my job. God is going to judge you in the Lake of Fire.

"Seriously want to know how long that choreography took to learn......man, they were on point THE WHOLE TIME!"
"Back for the 100th time now!!!!! Southa, am I alone in here?"
"Don't make Kendrick Lamar mad, I love Kendrick"
Come on Kendrick
Its so cool
Halftime shows will always involve the colors red royal blue and black and white psying homage to deep/dark state illuminati/reptilians......superbowl is nothing but huge energy siphoning ritual
I can't wait until July 25 and this is nominated for an Emmy.

Back here again...threee months later!! lol
10:17 absolute cinema
"I'm back here after getting Josh Johnson's dissertation on this monumental show and all I can say is art is the greatest form of intellect. I can't believe I missed that much detail in ""fine print""."
10:53 THE SMILE
6:00 peekaboo
the Buick GNX is a nice touch considering these songs are in the album GNX
Months later and I feel that Kendrick was one of if not the first to turn the Super Bowl Halftime Show into a short film. From the second the video begins Lamar immerses us in a story focused performance of his music. Even with the Apple Music logo at the beginning he uses it to set the scene for the performance. He could have easily ended the performance with pyrotechnics and/or fireworks but choose to give the audience an ending to the plot and message for the show.
"People critique this performance as being a glorified music video. Kendrick doesnt play with they audience - he almost ignores their presence all together - but plays to the camera. As a grocery store worker that will NEVER be able to afford to see the Super Bowl live, I appreciate that. He gives US a good show at home. The camera angles, the choreography, etc is done as if its a music video, but thats ok with me. The majority of us will never see these concerts in person, so finally having a show that caters to the common man is a breath of fresh air."
Here I am... again.
now this is what you call A PERFORMANCE the energy says it all
11:10 certified lover boy certified
Nobody understand what this guy is saying. Obsecure slang and try hard lyrics. Wack

the smile at the camera at 10:55 inspires me to be a better hater
The fact he censored his own songs in front of so much people kendrick is just too good man
Track court was probably a minorrrrrrrrrrrrr
Why he didn't sing money trees
The fact that he used this opportunity to pull the race card.
If all white people did this performance it would still be horribly boring
"Kendrick and Drake gave us an unforgettable musical feast. They gave us a golden era that we could say years later, ""yes, I lived that era."" I listen to both Drake and Kendrick's songs, but I was always a Kendrick fan."

"Why is it so quiet, I have my beats studios on and cant get it to bump"
12:50 *MUSTAAAAAAAAAAND*
Moster
Ok Kandrick Lamar
The most intelligently executed performance I had ever seen. The only problem is that it was too intelligent and multilayered for his intended audience to understand.
Good song respect crick photo please let me know
"Sincerely one of the best things I've ever seen Samuel L. Jackson do, and that man has done *everything*!"
Keren nihh Mamat gun shop
This should easily have been lil wayne without question. There is a reason the crowd can't sing along because they only heard of 1 song.
Y'all missed the point.
Everybody must be judged
My absolute favorite part 11:20
Kendrick's smile and energy on top

Pin me please nfl
NFL can you pin me
"Is it me, or are these halftime shows getting worse as the years go by?"
To think people were upset that they didn't let Lil Wayne up there
not a single white person in the whole thing. if a white performer did the same thing they would be called racist.
"9:55 that's the part we all came for, ur welcome"
Uncle Sam he is speeching for Kendrick Lamar enjoying the NFL Super Bowl Lix Halftime show 2025 In Apple Music

Me
April....time to get aligned for the summer objectives!!!!!!!
It's been 2 weeks 8 days 18 hours and 20 seconds. Boy that was close
Im back
2:47
Great dancers exhibiting great discipline and creativity in dance. Extremely organized and choreographed. Every scene is expertly timed and presented proficiently. Kudos to everyone for their highly professional production.
Every night I watch this since it happened. It's therapy for me.
Historical moment that I learnt from history books in 2047
I'm Baaaacck
9:38 this part just makes me ASCEND. Unreal.
I can't stay away
"My 6th visit! !! AND, shared with several others."
ugh ok ill try not to come byke tomorrow gng
Still not over it
Saw opening night of his tour in Minneapolis and this is bringing back so many great memories. True artist.
I cant stop coming back but why are there add in the middle of the video
"Im back again, how did he even do this, mind still blown"
Enquanto isso no vestirio do Kansas Chiefs...
"This is an absolutely amazing performance, but let's face it the part at 10:00 will be be written in history books"
They should do it again
"O, that's me a month ago. Still here. It's got me in a chokehold."
Ill be watching this 10 years from now
There hips
7:50 are the girls ok?
Im back waiting for 5/5
He has big balls and but
I'm here....again
Mais uma vez eu aqui
STILL WATCHING AS A NEW FAN AND IM NOT ASHAMED TO SAY IT
"Can European Americans have cultural events too, or are we forced to worship a culture that doesn't align with our values? Not judging just curious. This isn't for everyone"
Did anyone get that sample on when Uncle Samuel said to getto
lezzgooooooooooooooooooow #2ez4HAVENS
Who here again
I'm here again
This sing gives me battlefield 4 nostalgia Take me back
I'm here again
The best
People still watching it
"Kendrick is not an artist, DUDE IS AN ENTIRE CULTURE!!!"
Had to come rewatch after being at the grand national tour opening night.... what an incredible performer
9:07 i hate those that feel entitled Look at me crazy cause i didn't invite you
1:20 that part was good
"Can't stop watching, love it."
Me
"9:57 Admit it, you're here for this."
Okay we're back again

Artistic genius
"Sometimes you just gotta rewatch to get that feel good stuff in your brain in order to deal with a breakup, ygm"
7:20 8:30

"TY Kendrick Lamar for Russians colours used of yours show, come in siberia man!"
"The fact we all keep coming back, again and again and again is crazy!"
Best superbowl halftime show of all time
Who is here today?
Watching From Ethiopia
Fact that they was talkin bout The game And playstation is a game and the stage symbols were playstation buttons is crazy
this Peekaboo performance is the best rap performance I've ever seen
Egyptians are the ones who pass people through life and death. Allura is that crossover point. The plane of existence everything is based off of.
Theres that big red button that Drizzy was talking about
El mejor de todos lo tiempos.
That opening dance choreography was lowkey so good. They even threw in a Kinjaz reference!
LOve this
So is everyone gonna be quiet about Kendrick digging up drake and burying him again?
still looking at it
"The layers of meaning in this performance are still hitting hard, and the crowd participation was just electric! Truly a moment where hip-hop transcended the Super Bowl."
Crazy
I don't usually rewatch the superbowl halftime show. Here goes watch #5

OMG I can't get enough of this! Such a great performance and world class diss!
Why does he scream like hes getting smashed . Ahh!! lol
"Kendrick Lamar is amazing, but super bowl performance he sleeps good"
#THUGLIFE.
My favorite way to start my mornings in the USA
"Iconic, still"
"Is this lip sync or engineer magical work , really want to see actual performance"
Who is she?
"How Kendrick got away with this is beyond me. I'm lmao every time I see this, hands down half of the people there didn't have a clue what he was talking about, I have been listening to him since college. He is one of the best. I have no idea what his beef is with Drake, I think his more important message came across. He represented California well. Thank you. Peace"
Im back
Anyone on April?

I must be a bot cause I watch this everyday
This is really not good.
Who's the first intro song??????
"I love Kendrick so much. I heard the 40 acres and a mule but can we please remember the indigenous people who actually are the people of the land...why are they never talked about? Indigenous people are the most peaceful, and always have the best interest of the land"
I wonder if any of the dancers is a Drake fan
"2001, anyone?"
' !
Tell me why I'm here every week?!
Kendrick Lamar is super talented! I've been watching all his stuff and listening to his songs for the first time. I knew his name but didn't realize how great he is. I've never had a hip-hop or rap favorite before but now I do. Kendrick is King.
New every morning

Se sali el nota no tengo idea de ingls pero se salio
"Man, they did everything they could to keep the flags of Sudan and Palestine out of the shot. thats probably why Serena didnt get more than 2 seconds on the camera cuz of what was in the background. It's crazy how much effort the system puts in to keep your attention away from the truth."

One of the best live rap performances ever. The energy is unmatched
Scream 2025
Whats the first song?
"I heard instead of making lots of money/profits from performing in superbowl halftime show artists lose money as they invest alot in the show , and all the different aspects that comes with having a kickass show like KDot had here. _LEGENDARY PERFORMANCE UP THERE WITH MICHAEL'S PERFORMANVMCE_ KING OF THE GAME IMO"
"Can you imagine... Not being able to play music in a minor... Can't say the letter 'A'... Can't talk about the minor league... Can't say minority... Can't celebrate Juneteenth... Write the letter 'A' Go to any random public place that plays music... See blue jeans... See Black Buicks... Hear ANYTHING produced by Mustard... Hear about Inglewood, Compton or L.A. The list goes on and on... ...without getting triggered This is literally worse than having a curse And all he had to do was 1) Apologize for dissing the fam 2) Give the ring back Am I wrong?"
Gatorade got us here..again

What i dont understamd is HOW DID ALL OF THOSE PPL GET OUT OF THE CAR Also my mom didnt under stand that i knew every song WORD FOR WORD This is my second edit but the monday after we had art class and the boys were saying how sza had a big gyatt
"Let me tell you guys a story. Once upon a time in a far away nation there lived 4 kings. The kings of the NORTH, SOUTH, WEST and EAST. Each of these kings had their governors and lived among their citizens. One day a rich colonizer came and bribed the kings with false complements and gave the kings connection to riches. The kings were impressed. All the kings fell to the charm of the colonizer and gave the colonizer access to their people EXCEPT the king of the west who went on tour with the colonizer and saw through his lies. The king of the west tried to warn the other kings but they were surrounded by the false riches that the colonizer gave them and they laughed at the king of the west. The governors (meek mill, pusha t, etc) of the other kings also tried to warn their kings about the colonizer but their kings sacrificed them to the colonizer. The colonizer was not happy because he wasnt able to subdue the remaining king of the west and continued to taunt the king emboldened by the ease at which he controlled the other kings. The king of the west focused on his family and his citizens, winning awards and admiration. The colonizer was filled with envy, jealousy and hatred and decided that it was time to deal with the king of the west. The colonizer felt that he had mob ties and ghost writers and could destroy the king of the west. The colonizer released push up and tailor made freestyle taunting and insulting the king. The king ignored him and continued with his life. The colonizer taunted the king to DROP DROP DROP and went after the king's family and children. This was the last straw. The king went to the altar of God and prayed. The king asked permission from God to go to war and God approved it. The King won the war and the other kings out of shame became jealous of the king of the west and didnt congratulate him but it didnt matter because God was with him. This NFL show is the king's victory concert."

This hits hard
"Playing All The Stars in 2025, a real legend. Rest Peacefully Chadwick!"
He performed on the square and squabble up video was dropped featuring a lot of squares. He performed Luther in the triangle and the video was about love triangles. He performed peekaboo in the X and we currently seeing that one play out. Him and sza performed all the stars in the circle that mean .Expect either a collab album from them both or its about their stadium tour. Everything is a play in this game he have with Drake rn.

11:45 Tv Off
I am a bot i can;t be sued
"I wonder how much Kendick really knows about politics. Many talk a good ge like they do. But I would really like to ask him about The World Economic Forum and things that go way deep. Many know the shallow politics like those that are democratic, but do they really know? Not so much, and I wish folks would dig really deep into politics besides what's on the news."
"April 17, 2025 and I'm still loving the Halftime Show!"
Im back here after Drakes amended lawsuit lol

"Big man, put me on dody6"
Its April 2025 and I had to spend the block one more time who else?
"Kendricks performance was a perfect blend of storytelling and entertainment. He used his platform to highlight important social issues while keeping the audience engaged. While some people thought it was too political, his ability to blend history, identity, and culture into a powerful performance was a brilliant idea. He showed how music can be a tool for social change."

That man is super talented. P.S.A. never saw this many thxz chat
"The intentional camerawork and dynamic choreography elevated this performance to a whole new level, making it incredibly impactful for both the stadium and home audiences. The way he delivered that ""A Minorrrrrrrrr"" line with the crowd chanting along gives me chills every time. It's a cultural moment we'll be talking about for years."

"Hmm! (The musical fanfare heard at 0:09, at 1:19 and at 1:27 - in this clip) is a direct COPY by Kendrick Lamar from the 2024 Eurovision-winning song The Code, where that musical arrangement is heard more than once (at 0:26 at 0:32 at 1:15 at 1:22, link below at these timestamps) and in exact same way. Not only that, at Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar even COPIED the lit X (or +) part of his game board STAGE design, shown briefly at timestamp 0:05 in link below, from Switzerlands entry!!! Check out the proof in Nemos own Live performance, from last year: https://youtu.be/CO_qJf-nW0k"

This was just one big funeral for Drakes career
"I'm sorry, but this man is FINE"
"Perfect tone and breathing technique for the intro into luther transition. I'd say this is one of the nest performances i ever seen. Have been watching it since the Superbowl and still going back to it. I value the artists, his team and supporters as well as the production, the great people that danced there best perfectly choreagraphed. Thank you for this. Truely inspirational. Looking foward for more music too."
Its me again.
That was a good half time show... at the very least..... top 3 all time
5:29
"My goodness its like a guy bothering the halftime shows Super Bowl and the police whatever that cost, he saw him picked him up and he took him somewhere"
Sayyyyyyyy drrraakkke

When I say this does not get old for me... It does not! The entire show was a full vibe!!
"not one white person here, but if this was a white persons perfornace, 20% would be aisan, 30% black. and 10% muslim"
"Ive literally never once rewatched a half time show that I saw during the show. Ive watched ones before I was watching, like MJ. But this is the first show that ive been compelled to rewatch multiple times, let alone multiple times in a month."
Crazy that watching this performance is now a part of my daily routine.
the marching during all the stars is so satisfying to watch
Lets go sea

God bless America ONLY AFTER America blesses African Americans with REPARATIONS! It's not negotiable. It's not debatable. It's a MANDATE.
"Billy Holiday told you in her ""Strange Fruit"" song. Wake up, people! They hung our forebearers from a rope for sport, and now they want to dismiss us like rubbish. ""Before they hung them from a rope."""
I started putting MUSTARDDDDDDDDDD on my hot dogs now because of this halftime show.

SZA's voice is outrageous
"Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl performance was nothing short of iconic. He brought raw energy, powerful and unapologetic artistry to the stage, proving once again why he's one of the greatest voices of our generation. The way he weaved political commentary with stunning visuals and tight choreography? Legendary. It wasnt just a halftime show, it was a statement."
RIP DRAKE
Utterly outstanding!
They can takeover culture centres but black culture is everywhere and even here in the Middle East its in our hearts
Put lil baby in a ah
"I saw BTS copying this performance on TikTok, and it made me feel disgusted. I came here to erase that feeling by watching the original Thanks kendrick"
GREAT!
FREE PALESTINE!
"Kendrick Lamar deserves properly formatted captions, not auto translate guesses."
Yes. I am watching again.

Free palestine
I love him!
"Turn this TV Off, turn this TV Off"
who is here in April 2025

Best Halftime show ever
The way he performed luther was so soothing
At least what my sister said
When we were watching you at my sisters boyfriends party Im sorry the host or whatever looks like a pitbull
"Omg i don't even know who won the Superbowl. I just watched the half-time show, my bad"
The camera angles his stamina its all in sync and visually appeasing.
I didn't realize there were messages in the audience that was so cool
"Great performance. Hey, by the way, I don't see anybody complaining about fair racial quotas here. I don't see whites, latinos or asians in this performance. And it is OK, they were not needed. It is just perfect the way it is. America feels like America now."
Bro my parents could see Michael and I can watch this crab really in the wrong time
That performance from Aaliyah was the bomb! 8:00
APRIL 2025?
2025 APRIL?

"The layers of meaning in this performance, combined with the incredible choreography and Kendrick's raw energy, make it a truly unforgettable moment. It's more than just a show; it's a cultural statement that resonates deeper each time you watch it."
A minooor Hits different
"I pray that your heart finds peace, your mind finds rest, and your soul feels light again. Stay hopeful!"

"Im Japanese, but this video feels the most American to me."
"I'm back, again!"
"Every time you come and watch this , it has a different vibes, its presence is not over until next year, until the end of time"
Americans have horrible taste in music.We Russians are better in every aspect of life.
Vava baluch
Im Korean This music(not like us)is my favorite song I love Kendrick Lamar
"The layered storytelling and sheer artistry of this performance continue to resonate years later, proving its cultural impact far beyond a typical halftime show. The details, from the choreography to the Uncle Sam cameo, elevate it to iconic status. Timeless!"
9:55 a lo que vinieron
Type of music even Obama listen to it This is really good music

Une fan's de Kendrick depuis le Sngal
Came back to watch for the billionth time after watching the BTS!! Already loved the show but loving it even more I didnt pay attention to the gray mat during the performance but after watching the BTS and rewatching the show I see what yall meant by it moving but it didnt take away from any part of the show perfect!!
Yessir
9:59 fire
Just amazing
again...again.... and again
I wish I was there
Great performance
"big challenge for the next one, how will you overcome this one? I doubt it very much"
The say drake was crazyyyyy
Best performace ever
those ppl comments got liked by NFL if i where them i would scream
Who else came to get their DAILY DOSE Vitamin K today? 116M and counting
I'm back again to watch this and I am not a fan of American football but this was amazing!!!
"Je suis sous le charme de ce type. La culture, l'nergie tout quoi. Oncle Sam, le meilleur de tous les temps on se croirait dans DJUNGO. Et ce sourire jusqu'au oreilles ""So DRAKE"" j'en aurai piss dans mon pantalon. Kendrix au top ! GAME OVER"
Hardest ever seen
10:00 mi parte favorita
"As a representative from the white Cajuns of America, This was honestly one of the most epic Super Bowl performances Ive ever seen. The layers of messages run deep. I appreciate the creativity and vibe. Although as a white dude, I feel like the message is a little divisive, and I dont think common whites and blacks should be divided. I feel like its common folk that that should be united. In reality, Kendrick is a plant for the elite. They keep us divided to keep us weak. However, this message from Kendrick is hard but it needs to have a different receiving audience. Should be for all commoner Americans. Are differences are what make us special. Rock whi yall,"
Respect
10:54 bro this smile can tell you everything
like if you're here in April
The best halftime show OAT

"This was a very good half_time show! Serena did that crypt walk. Sza,they all did a phenomenal job . I would have been tired. That's Y they're professional"
"Beyond the breath control and artistry, the way he weaved social commentary into a mainstream event like the Super Bowl is what makes this performance truly legendary. This is more than just a halftime show; it's a cultural statement."

Then Mustard popping out at the end to show it aint personal its strictly business
"The 1 life being taken being AZ is still underrated, then having SZA portray the black lady who sacrificed everything to get her king out of that game."
SZA!!!!!!
This is the greatest half time show
Like if this is the best halftime show
The love for Kendrick is in my DNA

welcome back fellow viewers and comments readers.
April 5 2025 Im back again for the 9th time
EPIC.
a minor was insane
"Part of me is convinced that the reason Kendrick's face looks partially blank at 11:27 is because when the crowd chanted ""A minor"" he was probably holding back or down a huge victory laugh or smile and he knew when he came back up with the camera on him, he still had to be in 'performance mode'"
Soooo GOOD!!!
Man my adrenaline be rushing watch this
"honestly cant stop coming back to watch this again, there are iconic live performances in history we can point to and this is inarguably in the top 10."

Mon trait toxique est que je suis toujours excit comme si c'tait la premire fois que je regardais. (Je regarde cette vido tous les jours depuis le Super Bowl)
Again and again and again here
That daham Kendrick is a genius! I was wondering what was the significance behind the blue trianglewowwww!
bloods and crips united in hate for drake lmao
That smile on his face when he said say Drake I heard you like them young in not like us is just crazy
?
Had to watch this immediately after the Nokia video. Had to rid my mind of that calamity called music video
Samuel l Jackson was so annoying bro.
The precision (accuracy) and cohesion (togetherness) of the show is great. We used to be a nation that stuck together. We need to go back to our old way of life and stop the black on black crime and the black directed hatred. Well done brothers and sisters. May GOD continue to bless us and other nations?
"My mom said, ""You really bout to do it?"" So I had to come here."
Omg
I'm here for queen Sza

How many more times would you watch this?? Me: dunno yet...
"It is April 4th, and I had to come back (for the 10th time) to enjoy this performance's high level of artistry and our masterful Kendrick, Mr. Lamar! The level of coordination, preparation, professionalism, and emotional depth of this performance and his other performances, as well as his whole repertoire, discography, and videos, are absolutely stunning. Every detail, from the musical perspective to the stage presence and artistic perspective, reflects intention and pure excellence."

"It is so crazy to see this video go up 1 million views every 1 to 2 days lol I've been so fascinated by the discussions this show has caused. It's caused a weird generational divide. I (25 year old) was captivated by it, my Gen X mother hated it, but my 81 year old grandmother enjoyed it"

"Found a new love for kendrick for sure following his diss track being top 1 with 5 grammies and a superbowl performance, but what gets me the most is Black Panthers song was played on live television at the biggest game in the country, felt like a massive tribute to Chadwick."
"Back for more, I'm sorry everyone I have a problem."

Drake foi fumado mano
This has been my whole personality since it happened. IT HAPPENED
BEST
7:58
Who else is here in April 2025
Can't get rid of this performance. It's so memorable
SZA is the next Aretha. Kendrick has already proven his status. But she really brought it. They showed true talent and I am amazed with how that show went. It was a funeral and a celebration
Bro rejected the camere until he brought up drake
At this point I'm just feeling sorry for drake bro
Drake RIP
Khogen
BTW I just came back here after hearing about the FCC receiving 125 complaints.
"Will never not be impressed at how tight their choreography is and how hard it was to get large groups of soldiers to march in step with each other...... Turn the TV off indeed, s too pretty."
Best halftime show yall some haters lol
American bowl around past?
"I never thought I would enjoy this show so much and until that day Im still enjoying .Ive never heard about Kendrick Lamar beforethis show, but boy his my guy."
goes crazy on mute
"OMG!! This was not a halftime LMAO this was a movie, yes sir!!!"
I also see dead people
I love how he didn't say any bad words for the minors watching
I could have clicked on anything else but Id rather click on this. Facts
You cant fake influence. HE DID NOT STUTTER!!!
"That was such a thoughtful and generous move by Kendrick. Letting those football teams be part of his concert not only gave them an unforgettable experience but also showed how grounded and community-minded he really is. He continues to prove that hes not just a lyrical genius, but also a genuinely good person."
Here everyday because its the only thing that soothes my infant before nap time
10:19
Big as the what?
3:13
Bhai kuch leke aajao prr ekh ladki chapri ke sath hi jayegi

Awesome!
Non stop commercials and ads. That powerful
I was there in real life
Kendrick ran more yards then the entire KC offense
Z glike in M uhmaul
9:48 nailed it
"Yall, we paying for ad revenue. All the commercials after like 4 minutes. Think. Cappiing on his creativity. So we pay off his creative work. Making money off us just listening and comment? Stop!"
Now I have to listen to this 120 more times- one time for every FCC complaint filed.
"Que show foi esse??? Surreal, pra mim foi o melhor show do sculo."
Tell him Kendrick
Why all the commercials. He that powerful..smh
3:40 escuche phonk ???????
I think one of the coolest things about this is the fact that Kendrick was only about 2-3 hours away from me
Back again for the 100th time
"What the chain stand for Aubrey lol, and yes i am still coming back to watch this!"
The crowd yelling A minor
Everything about that was loud. Like 60th time here

"I always get goosebumps when Samuel Jackson says ""score keeper deduct 1 life"""
I listen to this at least 5 time I think the start was not that good but the end was good
Yo this jawn crazy . Just disrespectful.
"How does this woman see racism in this performance?! I didn't watch the super bowl - not a football or sports fan. But i watched parts of the half time show. I guess to her a Michael Jackson show would have been racist? Wow...As for myself I prefer classical music, but I can appreciate the artistry and hard work that goes into a show like this one. Would also have loved to see Michael Jackson in a live show, but missed that opportunity"
Im just fascinated how this production was done live. Its simply amazing

"I am Japanese and have no idea what his lyrics mean, but I have seen many of these videos and heard many of his songs. I love his songs!"
And there are people STILL out thete believing that Wayne should've done the halftime show...makes me laugh everytime.

SEEING HIM SING AND NOT CUSS HAUNTS ME!
Hey 7
"I dont think the masdes teally understand exactly what Kendrick pulled off here. There is so much to unpeel, but everyone focuses on ""the dis""."
THE NFL is a very uncaring organization because tell me why the nfl cannot set up a support group to help people that are addicted to this video?? TELL ME WHY!! Have some pity!! I NEED HELP!!
South Korea is still watching this video.
Kendrick shinin bright like the diamonds round his neck!
Wow
Real scrap show
The usa is cooked

The day the Drake died.
Yeah Im back again for the 1000th time
Here yet again Just cant get enough
"Im baaaack! in this 99.98 performance, I found 2 possible flaws in the video. @3:18 & @3:20 the in the red w/braids and the guy in front of him in the white with hair wrap both forgot to put their hand up, but still remained on task the rest of the show. @ 6:30 This show should win an Emmy!"
But what's the name of the song?
I'm back for the 21st time
"11:09 Shoutout to the girl in the back hitting the hardest Orange Justice ever, of all time"
He looked straight at the camera with that ducking smile HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING
This is most American thing
Drake so cooked they be playing not like us at disneyworld and now the Super Bowl? Nah he cooked
11:58 Free PALESTINE
Incredible.
"The performance wasn't bad (it was a hell of a lot better than Justin Timberlake's return to the halftime show, that's all I'm gonna say). But at the same time, I can understand why people who aren't Kendrick Lamar fans would be unfazed by it. He shouldve had more heavy hitters and well-known collaborators with him. I can see why critics would say he wasn't ""pop"" or ""mainstream"" enough to carry a solo Super Bowl Halftime Show. Not enough people know his catalogue, but good performance. I, personally, wasn't too moved by it, but I respect Kendrick."
Kendrick Lamar won sorry Drake
Kendrick went crazy
thank you for proving you can succeed while being a hater my king
the louder i play it the better
Voltei aqui para ver essa maravilha
Mehn Im obsessed
"R.I.P Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham"

"Idk why a Canadian thought it a good idea to go up against an American born and raised in Compton, CA."
Is this not Like us
"I'm actually glad this was the half time show. Honestly I never really heard or listened to Kendrick.... watching this and seeing many of his songs played all at one time, I started listening to him. Gotta say I'm a fan now. Kinda wish I would have known earlier., but that's ok. That's the beauty of music.. sometimes you become a fan or hear stuff when you're ready for it. I enjoy how a lot of his lyrics have so many meanings to it."
this is iconic ICONIC
Gets better with every watch
The smiles get me every time
Neanche un bianco nel gruppo. Quindi fatemi capire: i massoni democratici rompono i coglioni per l'inclusivita mentre i neri se ne fottono? Eminen forse ever

Greatest half time show of all time
Yall gotta see the whole picture. This was beautiful peaceful protest to let us American citizens know we need a revolution and take back our country from the government.
Big project
I feel bad that he messed up DNA towards the end. :/
Raising another wave of culture that screams A minorrrr and Mustard. Prophet fr fr.
"I love how clear it is that this Halftime Show was designed for the viewers at home. The cinematography is amazing, and after looking at some recordings from the crowd, it's obvious that this is a better viewing experience"
"I'm back again, for the third time"
"53 year old British Kendrick Lamar first time listener. This was stunning,best superbowl show ever? Hell yes. Late to the Kendrick party,but now a massive fan."
Greatest of all time!!!
Whos watching this one month later?

Worst SB half time show in long time. I mean thats not even music or singingthe dancing by itself wouldve been enough. But hearing that guy say stuff on a microphone is not entertainment for me.
Sit down
"For ""All The Stars"" part, it would've hit so much harder if there was a picture of Chadwick Boseman, since the song played at the end of the movie."

"There are so many great parts to this Superbowl halftime show...Serena Williams, Mustard, the dancers, the whole show feels like a musical play on steroids! The car with the dancers coming out, the guys sitting on top of the poles...I've watched this at least 50 times and I always find something new!"

The feature I'm most impressed from this show is Kendrick being able to remember to censor all the parts
"I want another Def Jam game with all the current hip hop artists including kendrik, drake, ans Cole,"
4:43 euphoria
His smile is contagious
Am still here for no reason

"I remember when there was music during Halftime, now it's just reciting monotonic lyrics very fast that make no sense at all. I am sure 'Mr.' Lamar has a profound memory what he is telling us, but for gods sake man, try to do something to make it at least enjoyable for everyone ! Learn a dance move, try to actually sing with more than one Note, pick up a instrument. Anything will improve this ongoing uninspiring wordslur you call music."
well im back again
G.O.A.T
Speed up the last song x1.60
Watching this almost two months later as a pick-me-up

Fica ainda melhor quanto mais vezes voc assiste. se colocar para repetir fica muito bom!!!
"The show was nice the movement by the dancers to make the different patterns were definitely eye catching but other than that , the Music was dead, you could have gotten Buster Rhyme, he would have done a much better show and he's more entertaining than this guy."
"No thanks I'm sorry im critical but this is old and boring already. Where are the real musicians,"
"So poetic, especially the beginning remind me of the novel ""Salvage the Bones"" by Jesmyn Ward"
Thats a Letter to XXXtentacion RIP
Mustaaaaaard!!!

Who still here in 2025
"I was thinking a few years ago Samuel Jackson was really blown away watching Beyonce and Kendrick perform Freedom at the BET awards which was the song Harris chose to use for her campaign. It feels like the tapestry of black ART, influence, and culture continues to weave through America regardless of the ugliness some people embrace"
Greatest revenge in music history
This is the perfect soundtrack for the fake highly publicized but never notarized
Obsessed in Australia.
people glazed him so much he got on the superbowl

Kendrick Lamar is the correct person to carry the hip hop torch. When the time comes he will be on a stage with other OGs and pass on the torch to the next person. We are the culture and we will live forever. PERIOD!!

Whoever put a commercial in the middle of this is fired
People who think drake is bad
This is the most rewatchable half time show ever
Him N sza was amazing on luther
"Whenever Im having a bad day, Ill watch this performance"
The ending hit deep. Drake dont even realize the beast he woke up.
this is aging like wine
Best halftime show ever!
10:00
"I didnt see it during the Super Bowl, so this is the first time Im seeing it because everyone was telling me that its the best Super Bowl Half Time Show ever and even surpasses Michael Jackson HTS. After watching this, all I have to say is. You all are crazy!!! It was good at best, definitely nothing to watch again or remember. All it was, was a music show to fill the time till the game started again. It was entertaining, but definitely nothing special."
One of the best !
and im back
I dont think Drakes coming back from this one
Trying out my new earphones this video never fails
As a KDOT fan from the jump. My mother passed away when I was young from an unexpected brain aneurysm and her name was Gloria. I need this jacket more than you know. Gloria is one of the most beautiful songs Ive ever heard.

EXCELLENCE in action!
Back again
"why am I still here? Turn this PC off, turn this PC off!!! My walk never be the same anymore. Bravo Mr. Lamar!!!"

Dopest Halftime Show in my lifetime at 46 years old next to Prince an MJ
Drake must be mad
I come back to this performance at least once everyday. This man has me needing a dose of this and his GNX album daily.
"Hated the game, loved the halftime!"
And people had the AUDACITY to say this was bad...well it broke records for SuperBowl. Kendricks GNX broke record sales AGAIN and Kendrick had over 100m listeners in a month...the power of TRUE Hip-Hop
Great performance
I think it was awesome
13:09 The only time NFL allowed someone to do a gun gestures
Serena is a queen
Each like is the number of times I've watched this halftime show.
The replayability of this half time show is amazing
Im only here cause of sister leveling season 2

This is so
"No disrespect to anyone but I feel like most Drake haters just go to Kendrick videos to hate and be annoying. Thats the difference with Kendrick fans and most drake fanboys, also dont go to the replies and hate or start arguments."

I enjoyed this performance so much that I made it my business to come back at least once a week. I'm still enjoying it
The way Kendrick is in this makes me feel like he would love Petty AF by LovelySlaughter xD
Drake is dead
back again!
Day 44: When does this presentation stop looking good?
Am I the only one who thinks that Kendrick Lamar is overrated and sings like $hit
EAGLESSSS E A G L E S EAGLES the kansas city chiefs nah They not like us They Not like us
"People say he messed up the lines on DNA, but if you got watch the ASL performance (which is ammmmazing) it was what he meant to do!!! KDOT DONT MISS"
"I love when music is about something! I'm Canadian, but when I hear Drake, all I think about is Degrassi"
But Rihanaaaaa
"""the energy only circulates thru us, everybody must be judged but this time God only favoring us"" I shed A few tears just after said that man"
Kendrick : turn this tv off My brain : turn this phone off
Zu wild
Who wouldve thought that the word MUSTARD!would become an iconic line in a Rap song ?
Love it
Still watching for the 100th time
"11:20 The crowd singing ""A minor!!!!"" With Kendrick game me chills"

Obsessed with this show
This Kendrick made every music platform alive. His breath control and energy on another level
Still getting goosebumps watching this
What a shitty performance
9:50 For what you have searched it
9:59 not like us
"Ok, I'll say it. This halftime performance is tied at #1 with Prince. They knew it was going to rain, but you couldn't script it any better than when he got to Purple Rain. They told Prince is was going to rain and he just said to the producers, ""can you make it rain harder."" This performance was revolutionary and still has the people talking. For that, I rank it at the top with Prince."

"Who else is watching it again on March 24, 2025?"
Love how shook everyone is by this Kendrick & SZA performance
"I'm a 53 year old white guy, haven't paid attention to rap in years, never listened to Kendrick Lamar that I'm aware of. This is as close to perfection as I've ever seen out of any production on this scale. Serious kudos to everyone involved especially Kendrick, just an incredible performance."
That's craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy
This is absolute cinema
Someone from 2025
"I am back again guys, I think for the 209th time"
its funny how he had the whole stadium singing mustard and not like us
the peekabooo from kendricks angels is so audibly pleasing omg
"According to the dislike counter, there were about 79,375 drake fans here watching this show hopefully, they only added those numbers in views to the 110 MM it has so far"
what a first track?
Im bacckk!!!
He really did well with censoring
Alxm Somalidi wa kasoo dhunty
The chambers just came out from nowhere
"I'm not black but this was fire"""
At this point I think NFL should take it down cos I keep on rewatching anytime it pops up on my feed.
Im biiiiike!
Say Drake
I can't wait for the tour!
BTW I watch this 1 once a week
Saaalutations
His breath control
no cussing in not like us
Wonderful song
Mustardddddd!!!!
"I love when PDFs are exposed to the world, but this is just MAJESTIC"
Serena QUEEN !!!!
In the music The man beat you
This performance was the first Id heard you
This is hella dope but where are the Karens who needs diversify lmao
Lol welp here I am again
Is it just me or why does it get blurry for the first part
Ive already watched this an unhealthy amount of times
Thank me later 10:00
this is not America. Send these people back home.
When the whole stadium shouts out A MINOOOR! I almost died! Priceless! Drake: -10 Kendrick: +1000000
All this did was making dissing others cool but I'm not a hater so I can't divide from my brothers sorry
"I'm still not over it! March 24, 2025."
I cant get enough of this this will be remembered for the most hype performance in NFL history
"Those four women behind Kdot, their facial expressions be telling its own stories."
I'm BACK AGAIN!
Gotta love his s**t eating grin!!
110m in a month is crazy!He deserves it all!
ight. He is the GOAT!!! I like how he produced the whole halftime show to be more enjoyable to be watched from home.
Still watching 6 weeks later
I can keep watching this over and over againI love this performance and story telling. Amazingly talented and creative
10:00 you are here for
10:05 let's start
"I don't know what is in this song but I felt nothing all. Had a clips of Michael Jackson's super Bowl and heard about this guy Kendrick Lamar. I don't k ow him as a musician coz am not a fan of secular music but seriously, how is not that people are cheering for this song? Hmmmmmmm.... Serious! Lord have mercy"
Best show EVER.
"Goooo,Kendrick I bet bros crying in bruhs bathroom"
Very nice of 130 million people to come to Drake's funeral.
3/24/25 whos here with me?
He dedicated for xxxtten.
Hey mustard Much love
Xxxtten
How many time have you watched this performance ? Me: Yes
That is NOT our favorite song
"This is ridiculous. Weeks later, and I am still in awe. This was a genius production. I need all involved to come to the front. NOW. The absolute GOAT!"
What a performance Kendrick
Smooth
How is this not the best halftime show
10:53 nah that smile though
"Yep, I'm back watching this again for like the 10th time"
Kendricks Haka
Hey Drake I hear like I am younge
Track list please
0:31
This super bowl is amazing
11:44 11:53 8:28
Would have been good if Lefty came just to say crazy scary spooky hilarious
Epic performance
I always come Here on morning and nights
Drake: Lawyers get ready. K Dot: Starts singing Not Like Us. Drake: *dead
I still get chills.
Hey Drake I hate you like them young
This was too good I watch it all the time!
He just reminded me I need to make a Chuck E Cheese reservation for my daughters birthday party in May
Bro cooked perfectly morethan drake did in his whole life
"Phenomenal performance, whos here today?"
"We literally watch this daily and can't ever get enough! Thank you for your artistry, expressing your truth always and uplifting so many of us out here. This was absolutely chef's kiss!"
I always start at They not like us! :P
the way he smiled drake aint coming back
4:42
24 Mar 2025 who is here?
I'm still here bro
March 24 and here i am again...
10:11
Ironic Im back again..x50 This show make my soul feel good
this is probably what ur looking for 9:44
I dont know why when Amazon workers delivers and then run away
But you cant bring the truth to me that was fire that whole line barz for sure
This was artistry
Kendrick and Absoul should do another collab
64 year old British woman here and this performance blows my mind!!! Goosebumps every time I watch it.
I dont think so but Im not really worried 06.78
Happy Monday y'all! Make this day count!
Good
Say Drake
"Im at least 10,000 of these views i love it"
Epic! Level Epic! K Dot. This is popping until the next Superbowl halftime show.
Drake's great great grandchildren gone be replaying this one day
110 million Los Angeles we up..
I love this guy. Viva Kendrick a beasts and the best
The additional of Samuel L j was legendary
100M Views in a month is crazyyyy work
Since when is so many ads there weren't when it was uploaded
the look in his eyes in the part see drake i hate you like im young is crazy
HDR?
Too GHETTO.
Why is this an everyday visitation for me??
Annoying. This makes no sense. You can't even understand what he's saying. They act like elderly people don't exist by putting this as a halftime.
Who listening now!!!!!! Drake where are you?!
LETS LIGHT THIS B//TCH UPP. Dont Sit Down MUSTARD T&J 12:30am Pink A Boo
9:49
Back at it again igghhht
This is bout my 11 hundredth time watching . Love u Kendrick
Its crazy because Kendrick performed this in front of the President.
Having Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam is unexpectedly.
10:52
This was ok. The Dre and Usher superbowl performances was much better and more artistic and hype.
11:53 POV:You have a Hot Dog with Tomato sauce but you need some
Is Kendrick ok? It's like he completely fell off the map after this. The beef with Drake made KL. Does KL even have an identity without Drake anymore? I guess he's gonna have to keep the beef going if he wants to stay relevant. He's had great songs but this one really made him.
10:05
Ahh space vibe
Had to come here after all the hype
"Actually, this was pretty good. Watching it over and over again, one can appreciate the talent and coordination that went into this production."
I just came here for MUSTAAAAAAAAAAARD
"Whys nobody talking about the ""Game Over"" at the end of the performance?"
im back
Good morning from the other side & we came back againnnnnn
"Thank you, KDoT! All the Women are Dressed for a change! I am so necessarily Happy/ Elated. Thank you!! Im here again on Monday 3/24/25 @ 1:27 a.m. est"
what song is 9:00
This will live on forever
I ship Sza and Kendrick

This hits different after watching the bts
09:51 Almost there
"3,40"
This is what everyone is crying about? You guys need a life
This is up there with this is America by gambino. Insane amounts of views in such short time
Got my family singing Aaaaa miiiinooooor!
Im back again
Welcome to the funeral of Drake
11:22 a MINOOR
Oh no
@SamuelLJackson. Good educational positive vibe thanks for keeping it real
Watching on repeat tooooooooo goooooooooddddd
The symbolism was so clever
I feel bad for Drake now
Love it!!!!!
Nah. Rihannas was still better. Dres was the best.
Stg I put a million in these views
"""It's me again"""
"12:13 - 12:18 ""Ain't no other kings in this rap thing, they siblings Nothing but my children, one shot they disappearing"" >>> This line was a nod to Biggies ""Kick in the Door"""
Alright I admit it. I'm back again.
Back again
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far.
Glad to witness the best super bowl halftime ever go....king Kenny....west side
3:25
Listening to this while going to work so that i show this attitude to my bosss
Here we go ..im here
I'm back again
Ts never get old
Im here once a week lol
"I have watched this Super Bowl halftime over 10 times and I still cannot get enough of it. The way that this performance was I have seen Super Bowl. Halftime shows for years and years and I have not seen one that has pulled me away like Kendrick. Lamar's performance, it was genius."
100th time here<3
"One month later and still coming back here... everything about this is so crisp, sharp and flawless!!! Lovin this show"
Great Job I Like This Video!
nfl 2 nfl
Imagine Drake Maye on stage when Kindrick says say drake
I really have to stop watching this. The Bowl was close to 2 months ago. #1
"The way he was edging ""not like us"" was insane"
Back again
Are we not going to all about how it said game over at the end ( drakes career)
Who elses child is addicted to this song lol
9:26 Love the way SZA's hair flows and she enters the set all Goddess like
https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JqS_vsmxJg&feature=shared this kendrick lamar best inspiration
The greatest halftime show in history.
I'm still gonna come back here in 10 years time! What a perfomance
w kendrickxx mr moralixx i love youx
Wow the video reached almost 110 million in just ONE MONTH
"100th view or more. Anyone here with me on 24/03/25 (Australia). Never rewatched a movie like this before. The show flows so seamlessly, it takes me to a different space. Thank you KENDRICK AND PGLaNG. Thank you NFL and JZ. We cant wait for GNX tour. Pls pls."

Best Super Bowl Performance!!!! Love Kendrick Lamar !!real art .....real lyricist
Sza put tears in my eyes
"March 24,2025 and I am back.. who's with me?"
Power lift with Olympians too.very clever Mr.Kendrick
"Im with those white folk, one of the most boring half time shows, only that one song that was any good. He was also the weakest link on the Dre halftime show, he ruined that one."
bell bottoms look cute on kendrick lol
WHO PUT ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PERFORMANCE ?
I cannot figure out what the big deal is...his fault is hardly audible.
My favorite SB HT show Ive been alive to see to date
I dont wanna say Drake ran away as far as he possibly could but he was in Australia while this was going on
Is it just me or does All the Stars make you emotional ?
OMG
24.03.25 .....
11:23: everyone show your A game
Still listening daily like an anthem
"I just want those jeans, okay???"
tuff
how did he get that gnx in there?
All I can say is . The GOAT
"""SAY DRAKE, I HEAR YOU LIKE EM YOUNG"""
MUSSSTTTTAAAARRRRDDDDDD!!!! and all the stars just memory
"'Can't get enough of this masterpiece! (And, I am consider a senior!) (March 23, 2025)"
"This will go down as the most unique halftime show in history. We've never seen an artist take the folks at home into consideration by constructing the performance around their TV screens. We've never seen a performance that emphasized the camera work and cinematography, making the show look like a music video inside a live performance. We've never seen a show have skits in the middle of it. We've never seen a show with this amount of messages and symbolism inside of it. And we've never seen a performance spark a huge trend across social media to have people mimicking a dance move. I said it before, all the people saying ""worst halftime show ever"" will be the same people coming back to this and realizing how dumb they sound. And whether you liked it or not, numbers is what it really comes down to. And Jay-Z made the perfect decision to pick the hottest artist of 2024 who won Song of the year and 4 other Grammy's just a week before this. Now look... it's the most viewed halftime show ever."
Fire
"Who is here today? march 23, 2025."
I LOVE it so MUUUUUUUUUUUUCH!!!!
!! 2pac ??? ???
Single greatest piece of art of all time!
Ok ok ok I promise this is my last time watching this
10:02
FineIll watch it again
Put on again
Put on again put them on again
Uncle Sam was my favorite part
What are you talking about x
Im still not over it
i love this sm
Hey
That was a fantastic performance! Kudos to Kendrick and the backup dancers!
His dancers were so on point
"Okay I Figured It Out, Kendrick Is A Chevy Hard Body Fleetwood Wood Grain And The Rag Top On White Walls.. With Trus and Vougez"
Did he find is broccoli??
Just noticed the stadium roof was the red botron that Drake was supposed to push during the beef
"Is the ending part of Eurphoria from ""Like that"" or am I tripping?"
2025?
6:30
KDOT is ALL of us
"Dont care what anybody says, top 5 halftime performance of all time."
This was honestly one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows ever! Kendrick cooked and made crazy beats at Drake
They say that the halftime show had more than 133 million views. That must be true because I know I have watched and rewatched it at least a million times!!!
Im going back in to work tomorrow and then Ill go to work on my car so if I dont hear back Ill call the police and let him out and get the keys and Ill get the key and then I have Kendrick Lamar
idk why i like listening to this everytime i play fortnite
I keep rewatching this performance. Unironically i get goosebumps everytime
The first time we were in a car park was when the sun came up and we were in the car park and we were in the front seat of the car and the other one was a big white
MUSTARD!!!!!!!!
"March 23, 2025. AND I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS!!!!!someone please help my mental health"
Every piece of this was entertainment. One impressive fact about this performance is that most of the songs are relatively new.
Serena looks like that this is her Best 10 second in life
The greatest halftime show EVER!!!!!!
10:17

"So the most watched parts of the video finally dropped, drake mad af"
Let's take a moment to applaud these dancers
THE GOAT
"Amazing how this video keeps gannering millions of views more than new videos, then tell me Mr Compton didnt perform."
"Don't speak on the family Crodie..........If you take it there, I'm taking it further. Psst! That's something you don't wanna do."
https://youtu.be/kPa7bsKwL-c?si=62rrd4Nq8yitV81l
Never forget Drake was begging Kendrick to respond
"Drakes career will forever be remembered as ending as soon as the entire viewing audience said A Minorrrrrr. Dont know when that was irl, but that time will be infamous alongside Drake"
"Powerful, Powerful performance."
Cant stop watching. All time great halftime show. Love Kendrick
Kendrick is a goat
Still here! .
Rappers are so good at talking so much I cant even talk that much
Dream to perform in fifa world Cup
ava pui miah2 ve lal Kendrick Lamar ka duh pa
Had to slide back thru K Dot goated for this one
"Not gonna lie, this? 10/10. KL, its hard to get to your level. Daaaaayiummnnnnn"
Listen drake
My favorite part is he presented Emimem with the blue jean white boys. America
3-23-25 & I'm just seeing this. When a man gets your Ex to dance on your diss song during a Super Bowl Show & she so locked in doing it... Bruh you are straight ROASTED...
I just now realized the A minor chain
"55,000 people singing a minor in unison, not counting the people who watched it on tv. Kendrick, you have arrived."
i cant stop watching
Juro q pens q cantaba Snoop dog
AND THE CROWD GOES SILENT
Bro I Was at the super Bowl. IT WAS FIRE!!!!
This performance always gives me the chills
"Thee Most EXPLOSIVE performance since FOREVER AGO Brilliance in a nutshell , pure GENIUS !!!"
"No no no no no noo! Too loud, too reckless, too... Ghettoo"
"The chemistry between the ladies and Kendrick was clean and classy, am I the only one who loves it?"
LEGEND!!!
10:02
Sza lip syncing her part frustrated me ngl
Hooked and back again
Back again
Bro INVITE KENDRICK BACK 1 more time please do it
Why this so minimalist superbowl is so addictive?
kendrick won awards for being a hater. i feel inspired
Nice but....Is that playback?
I love when he sings not like us
30 day complete
(8:28) WAKANDA FOREVER!
So if this ain't in history books I'll put it in there.
Nahhhhhh
Well here I am
I LIKE THE DANCES
This is the only rewatchable music video ever. Still watching it. He even sounds better live. Love it
When he did b humble i list my mind i play that everyday 2025
BEST HALFTIME EVERRR.KENDRICK AND SZA KILT IT PERFECTION
Como o nome da primeira msica?
To start it off with a giant red button that drake threatened to press diabolical
came back again its just too good not to watch
Back again
Skibidi
One of a few rappers I can actually understand.
"absolutely FIRE, cant say i'm NOT suprised on how y'all got this TOGETHER. Not gonna lie, my family coundn't say how amazing it was"
Mussteeerrddd
"""Yeah that song"" get me everytime lmao"
Probably the best Superbowl Halftime Show I have ever seen.
Kendrick and those jeans....my gawd
What an absolutely beautifully layered and textured montage of what it is to not be what they think we are.... Such tremendous growth as an artist in less than a decade. God Bless you and yours.
EPIC! LEGENDARY
I have never had so many ads on a twelwe minute video. Cant rewatch this
i am eagles fan
"At 11:58 if you start slowing it down and look closely in the back you can see Pro-Palestinian protestors, so proud they got to do that on live TV"
10:52 Say Drake
Literally cried rewatching this how could he have done it any better
And Im back here again
Today is March23 and i keep listening to this music. KENDRICK FOREVERRRR
welcome to the one year anniversary of the funeral of drake beef family!

10:08
THIS WAS AWESOME
Me
this is the only super bowl performance i havent stopped rewatching. idk man theres something about it that i love
whats the song during 0:20
Camerman is in creative mode
I have rewatched this countless times
"8:30 these guys are more in time than some marching bands, even drum corps! A drum corps is a marching band without woodwinds btw. For example: The Blue Devils drum and bugle corps 2014 show Felliniesque not only got the extremely unfair world record-breaking score of 99.650, but they also had some brass members out of time. That means that their feet werent hitting the ground with the beat. Watch a few dci or marching band shows. Youll notice quickly that they march to a beat."
It's been a month? Gotta come back again....
The performance is very hard and higher Nice
Back again. lol
Best performance EVA!!

6:06 DEDUCT ONE LIFE!

IPL is better than NFL
"Serena Williams crip-walking on camera is probably one of the most cathartic moments of her life for two reasons XD All the stuff Drake put her through, and when she got yelled at by conservative media outlets for doing it to celebrate a match win. And now she's doing it at the Super Bowl in front of millions of people."
10:20 if anybodys looking for the diss
The girls deserve a raise
Kendrick will be president by 2050 https://youtube.com/shorts/AsxCdbumMjk?si=7Ruyy920AVsnFnAv

7:20
"His breath control is and performance technique is HEAVY,"

"Been a month, and here I am again...."
"Michael Jackson in 1993 - heal the world, make it a better place. Kendrick Lamar in 2025- hate, hate, hate. Wtf is going on in USA,people?! And all that Squid Game set up. But, one must give credits how he remembers all those texts while running miles and miles and miles."
https://youtu.be/kPa7bsKwL-c?si=0uR3x2kQPwRdJCRX
"the quality of the audio on this video has changed in the last few days, it used to be much better. Whatever you did, undo it please."
"Everyone saying no one hype up but he went claim way dancer,flow and more I think if he have went more hype way and everyone starts to jump around accident might happen maybe that's the reason I guess"
That. BUick International is gorgeous! Vroom
"I cant stop watching this. It is on my playlist. I dont like to hear he did a horrible job. He did AMAZING!!!!! And also all the backups, dancers, singers, you are all amazing!!!!!"

Mustard deserves it all. Glad he got so much
"At 12:55 whoever was closest to the microphone you can HEAR a bro say ""GOLLL-EEEEEEEYYYYYY!"" Yessir, yessir!"

It will be difficult for any artist to top this performance
Next Super Bowl they should get rage against the machine to perform

I would not be surprised if somewhere within the next 10 years the NFL pick Kendrick to perform again.

Drake crying in the corner
I can hear the crowd singing and cheering

legendary performance! well done!
"The ""hey drake I hear em like I'm young"" is gold"
Whats the first freestyle?? Is it out? cause I got that one minute on repeat
I find it funny how Kendrick had to remove the swearing out of his songs yet Samuel Jackson repetitively said dang
Well its been a couple weeks. Here again.

Why more ppl look at he's song but not this

There are white people that understand what is happening. Some of us folks don't celebrate the 4th of July or Thanksgiving. We dont ever support the annexation or slavery in said land. Some us have dropped everything to become part of the wave. We are gathering....but give us time. Whit people are stupid from their own culture. But we are gathering.... #wearetgewave When i need inspiration i come here over and over. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GIFTS!!
"People saying that this is boring, are *DUMB* I don't know all the other songs either but i can still say that this is the best! Y'all just want to hate so much on successful people"

"The dancing in this performance is so elite.

"Best halftime show EVER. GOT CHILLS AT THE BEGINNING AND END! And because of how awesome it was, i started down a rabbit hole on K Dot and found out amazing things about him. Love Kendrick"
Brutal

I never watch the Super Bowl. I don't even know any of Kendrick Lamar's songs. But this showed up in my feed. I'm in love now. Hey Kendrick.
"First the grammys, then the halftimme show, then Conan O'Brien: ""Now that the show is halfway over, its time for Kendrick to call drake a p3do!"""

Watching this is still on my daily mourning routine after a month and a half
"We keep coming back to this and some people out here saying that it was boring He ain't doing it for y'all, he doing it for the culture"
Him performing Euphoria was very unexpected but SUPER HEAT
Amazing

"i am 71 yrs old and i am a r&b fan, i havent gone a day without watching this once. ok as i said i like rhythem and blues.. i have also become a kendrick lamar fan. especially after i found out what those references meant. i first thought a minor was reference to musical notes. didnt understan why everyone shouted it with him. then i finally figured out . at first i was taking it out of context....so i listened to iit and realized that it had to be reference to the pedohile and relized he was saying minor as in underage child. i was rolling.+"
Im an old white lady and I love Kendrick.
"I keep coming back and appreciating the production value ,thought process and rehearsal it took to put this classic together."
Who's here today
"Even bro's chain is ""a"" MinOr"
ok tell me what i missed with time stamps
En verdad fue un excelente show. y mucha coordinacin.
"I have never watched any show on repeat like this one in my life. This show grows on you. I have now almost memorised the lyrics, well done to me. So inspirational and close listening breaks your heart, realising what Afro Americans have to go through to make it. Long live KDOT."
The lady voice is soo fine
Trust me i'm watching this performance every single day x)
Cant even count the number of times Ive rewatched this
"He better win a Grammy, Oscar, Tony, Peabody, People Man of the Year Award in 2025"

This is insane!
"""I had an extremely violent motorcycle accident. A car cut me off. I should never have survived this fatal accident. But, I came out of it unscathed.

Does anyone know the reason why this is not in 4K? I'm genuinely curious why that is

100m VEIWS!!!!! LETS GOO!!
I like the fact he took the time to pause the beat remind us who he his at 11:47 incase yall forgot
Kendrick still burying Drake in the halftime show after all this time made me feel a lot better about the Chiefs loss.

this video is the definition of addiction
I don't know how much time I watched it already
7:00 drake song

"It baffles me how anyone can call this the worst half-time show, there's so many little details, and all of them make it probably the most rewatchable half-time show in superbowl history since you'll notice something new every time"

CONCERT ROAST
"There are over 106 million views and I am probably 600 of them. Kendricks performance was amazing and his message is clear That Say Drake was diabolical. Every person on stage holding up a one, the crowd collectively screaming A minor what a beautiful funeral for Drake"
I want to go to the NFL

"Finally surpassed 50/JA, Record sales over 9000!! Sad it ruined majority of peoples enjoyment for the halftime show, tasteless record sales beef. All time low for an artist to abuse this privilege..shame on you (Turn this TV off) , liked you on money trees , cartoons cereal , ADHD .. you've fell off homie , stooped low.. ""Very Racially Diverse also"" wonder who funds majority of your album/mp3 sales .. hmmm (10/10 Worship Malcolm X again)"

"The fact he's staring at the camera like drake is watching while saying ""say drake"" and staring at the camera also at the end he said turn this tv off BC it'd a song but he actually said it to tell drake to turn the tv off and stop watching..."
100M in a month bro... Can we get to 1B before 2025 ends? Just kidding. Unless...
March 17th I'm addicted
Drake prob crashed out
The performance of ALL TIME. back here again. Goosebumps every time!
https://youtu.be/pequJxOVS0Q?si=Bxued3Pm4E4PlWPg
I'd seriously wonder about the backlife of folks who'd not rock this Guess that's about theybissue
"Honestly, this will likely go down as one of THE best halftime shows to have occurred in modern history! Several meaningful and relevant political, social and cultural references and representations all packed in 13 minutes, both obvious and subliminal. Not to mention that this was also a touch-notch, well-orchestrated, and straight-up entertaining performance, hands down."
Why didn't I see this before?
Back again lol
Alguien que hable espaol aqu?
Wow.... Talentless.
Hello....its me again....

"I love Kendricks songs but he really didnt play the track list of his great songs.. it was super boring imo and most didnt know them and at 5:30 and 7:30 the crowd started leaving for breaks lol nobody sees this cause it didnt show the crowd. But trust me they were not into it like last years ppl said he tried to send a msg but idk most ppl are watching yhe Super Bowl feeling good , few drinks and few and want to vibe not interpret msgs in songs.. I just wish his track list was different and online votes showed the same..,, it was definitely not a halftime that ppl watching were getting hype to. But I love Kendrick as an artist and if his fans were happy thats all that matters.."
"This like the 6 or 7th time, Ive ran it back."
1:23
someone should do a wellfare check on drake
@wetalkproductions
"""OH NOO"""
This is the first time id have a half time show in my spotify wrapped

FORT SCOTT KANSAS
EMPRESS CLITHING
MY FIRST ADDICTION IN LIFE THIS KENDRICK LAMAR VIDEO
I JUST MESSED UP LA HACIENDA BABE- WENT IN AND PISSED ON THEIR ADS
Creative genius! Worldwide influence.

Here again after watching the BTS!!
Ive watched so many times that I sing the Halftime Show version when listening to the actual album!
It'll be 10 years before they have another Black Artist at halftime. Drake don't count.
I am calling the angels down; I AM STORMING THE GATES OF HELL; Tell the Devil he dont own my soul. I AM TAKING BACK WHAT THE ENEMY STOLE!!!
11:36
Is anybody gonna talk about how at the end of the video the crowd lights said game over?
Why not 30for30
This show was amazing
"0:20 Uncle Sam's first appearance 0:31 Bodies 1:34 Squabble Up 2:48 Uncle Sam's 2nd appearance 3:04 Humble 4:08 DNA 4:43 Euphoria 5:27 Man in the Garden 6:01 Uncle Sam's 3rd appearance 6:10 Peekaboo 6:59 ""yeah that song"" 7:25 Luther 8:29 All the Stars 9:49 Uncle Sam's final appearance 9:57 teasing THE song 10:17 Not like Us 11:28 Serena's shot at Drake 11:45 TV Off kj"

Back agin.
Say drake
How is no one talking about how good his dancers are

Certified loverboy certified WAAAAAAAA
NAM SONG
Kendrick lamar inspired instrumentals on my page.
"From the energy, the lyrics, to the stage presence, this performance was a moment in hip-hop history you can feel the impact radiating even now. The layers of meaning and the sheer artistry elevate it beyond just a halftime show; it's a cultural statement."
3:50 i don't think enough people talk about the crowd shouting at this point
Tik tok time
Leyend king
Still watching
It was awesome!!!!!
"Me gusta Camila este comentario se perder , Camila MT por siempre mi gente"
Here for the 50-11th time

"Kendrick is iconic but can we talk about how immaculate SZAs parts are. The vocals, the choreo, the fit is all perfection"
O cara e bom

TOO LOUD. TOO WRECKLESS. TOO GHETTOO.

"As a football fan from the outside of the US. (Real football, you folk call it soccer) i find these musical interludes are absurd. How come people focus on them and can't think about the match."
One of the best shows EVER. Makes me keep coming back for more!
"Bro just came in, destroyed Drake and moved on"
"March 17,2025"
Im back here again for 147 play

WHY YOU TROLLING LIKE A _____ aint you tired trying to strike a cord but its probably a minorrrrrrrrrrr
dumbest halftime show in the history of all superbowl halftime shows
Watching it for 5th time
I come back here like every day for the snippet bro
March 2025
Say drake:)
andd im back again
"Bro he just perform disstrack on super bowl, Drake cannot comeback from this he's charcoal now"
Super Bowl? Nah. That was the Kendrick Lamar Halftime Roast Special. And Drake? He got the VIP seat in the burn zone.
"I'm obsessed, I watch this video more than 5 times a day. Kendrick made history again"
How did you like that show AmeriKKKa?!
Best halftime ever
Okay...watching this is becoming a daily routine
The camera work is
"Back after watching the behind the scenes. Incredible. This is only the second half time show Ive ever watched. Dr. Dre, Eminem and them were the first."
That's what's going on with the move and the video was mustaaaaaaaaaaaaaaed
The only reason why you should have to pay the mortgage on a property you have to buy a home in the state to get it is to get the loan done before you go into the state of your property taxes are due you have no idea
"Had to see the video again 3/16/25 Luv the art, and the message."
We're back!
This isn't a halftime show. He took advantage of the super bowl to make a music video that didn't need to stand on its own to be popular. Smart move on his part but it's a ripoff of all the people who bought Superbowl tickets compared to previous years.
I cant stop coming back March 17th whos with me
I stood on my balls.
"I tried to play nfl once, i got my balls torn."
Eagles

UNFUCCWITABLE!!!!
"It just never gets played out. This is a masterpiece. Kdot, the dancers, set design and all the volunteers that got that production set up and torn down in 5 mins. No one will ever forget this."

This was great
I can't stop coming back March 16th who's with me
March 16 who's here with me ?
Such a bully
"- [x] I thought Meghans show was aspirational and beautiful. I thought she was nervous but very down to earth with all her friends, and gave a good message. That you dont have to have money to make special moments for loved ones to let them know you care. Just add a ribbon, a personalized note, make a gift bag, Add some supermarket flowers, Decorate your cooking, and surroundings and look nice to set the vibe youre going for. All simple, all doable when throwing a party. I loved the practical advice! And, she was very personable and fun while explaining her way of thinking. She was nervous, and it comes out in her as perfectionism, but she explains that shes a nerd who always goes the extra mile for a gold star. We all know people like this, and most of us are grateful for them. Im not sure what you people are always talking about. Every time Ive seen her in T.V., from the Ellen show to her documentary shes always been real, gracious, kind, funny, and willing to embrace her shortcomings, but determined to be better. Thats my impression of her. Despite what everyone keeps trying to make me believe about her. Im a good judge of character so Ill make my own assumptions from my own eyes. Thank you all very much."
"Best show i have seen in over 60 year's, shame it was so short, interrupted by football"

"this being the worst superbowl halftime show according to boomers feels like an achievement. his music wasn't made for boomers, it was made for the new generation."
"aight let's see how many likes these generic comments get I can't stop coming back, 16 march anyone?"
8:21 love sza's pose

I can't stop coming back. March 16 who's with me
Some people don't like how this played out but the message was needed meaning that we have an orange face in seat where felon's are not supposed to sit. But their saying to the world that they (the Government) can do what they want but (us) as a people have to do what we got to do but act accordingly.
This has 10x more views than the actual football game
The fact that Kendricks halftime show is better than the actual football game
"I am black, i didn't enjoy this show, very over-hyped"
March 2025 kendrick listner.

Ducktales brought me here.

"""Let me hear you say MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD..."""
Biggest opportunity to capture a different demographic of fans but decides to sing about another man
An Amazing show! Kendrick is Brilliant!

Mustarddddddddddddddd
Im still listening today March 16th 2025
Art in its greatest form.
I came back after seeing the short behind the scenes of how it came to be
10:05 crazy
"SERENA WILLIAMS!! The fact that Kendrick brought her out to do her dance made me so delighted! She did NOT deserve all the hate she got. That woman is absolutely strong and outstanding. Also, Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam and the meaning behind that will keep my head spinning with awe. This is the BEST halftime show in history"
Still watching the replay! its SO good!
whats the name of the first song
BIG AS THE WHAATT?
this is too addictive. March 16 who's here with me
"In a bold act of defiance, Drizzy opted to keep his TV on."

THE ROAD TO BREAK TOP 5!!!!!!!
6:59 perfection
I watched it atleast 40 times
Kendra your biggest fan
"I may be responsible for 4,000 or so of these views"
"I keep thinking about this. This one little move was sheer genius. He's obviously in great shape, but he took the opportunity to use the censoring required to be family-friendly to leave himself gaps to breathe instead of filling every little censored word with another word. Brilliant."
why kendrick was being messy for not like us lol
7:23 1sec goat
Nobody mentioned that this is AMERICAN SQUID GAMES
what's the word used to replace the n word
I wonder if drake watched he made em * turn the off
Whos back after watching the behind the scenes documentary
The way PEOPLE SAID IT WAS LAME
The production is absolutely insane for this. It's like a music video in 1 take live in front of 150 million. 5:07 the walking camera crew stops under the beam to they aren't visible by the overhead shot
this hasnt even got as many vies as that pdf file has followers
Make this comment famous cause like uh why not???
I cant get over the part when Mustard came out!

"A friend of mine used to tell me about Kendrick now I know who he's, I can't count how many times I to come here to watch this, Addictive."

"It gives me chills behind my back, evertime I watch this just imagine how drake feeling tho"
11:33 SZA IS DANCING
Say Drake

This is the best half time show ever to be in the face of our racist president who had to put himself there when he had no business being there.
The best of all time was prince ! But here he was the best ! Because prince died ! Enjoy
The reason u are here: 10:15
POV: They not like us K.Lamar: No!
I'm sure I'll show this to my son someday proud that I got to witness it.
The most impressive thing on this Super Bowl was that they set up this extremely fast
"This video has 105 million views, 1 million from my home alone!"
They ain't like us.
Drake is cooked
"He told us, you listening? TURN YOUR TV OFF! It's time to hit the streets, people..squabble up!!"
Ill definitely be back again :those ads are outta control
10:53 SAY DRAKE

"100 million views in a month, and everyone said this was the worst halftime show ever"
Im here again for the 7th time..
Chefs kiss
This man prepares Thanksgiving Dinner for us and some of you come to the table mad because he not serving spaghetti with hot dogs cut up.
9:59 The best reward
"When I heard ""All the stars"" playing, I thought about Chadwick like it was a bit of an ode to him in a way even though it was Kendrick's song"
Quc t n khc bt tht
12:29
Back here again. This is my 20th time watching this video.
"Podem falar o que quiserem, mas os americanos sabem fazer um espetculo esportivo"
This Super Bowl looks like black racism. Why are there only black people in the halftime show? Are white people no longer worthy of participating in such events?
10:52 say dra

Following the Civil War, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman issued Special Field Order No. 15 in 1865, which proposed to allocate land, in plots of up to 40 acres, to newly freed Black families along the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida."
"The behind the scenes, YouTube video makes this performance that much better"
"Just finished watching the BTS footage, mind as well watch the show again for the 100th time."
Im in here again watching this great show!!!
I can't get enough of this.
Its crazy how reporters that haven't heard a rhyme since elementary school were calling this the worst superbowl performance ever. This performance was Chefs kiss

"all time superbowl it would be prince, followed by Kendrick Lamar with limited resources and lowered the budget because diversity doesnt pay, nope diversity carries the weight of america as of now. now america the true land owners and those immigrants that made america that western racist country that hated from every every country as of now"
Say drake I heard you like them young The smile was crazy

"""You would not get the picture if I had to sit you for hours in front of the Louvre"""
Like this if youre watching in 2025
"I saw another clip on Twitter, and now I'm back... This cycle is viscous..."
"If the lady who choreographed this performance doesnt win an award for this, Hollywood shouldnt exist anymore"
"That, much people was not in the car bro lamar's."
"Samuel, Jackson one of the big movie star yeah."
This was amazing!!
I lost the count of how many times i watched this
Funeral
"The dancers (the ones wearing blue) in the background during ""This World"" are insane Whenever this part of the show comes on, I keep watching them specifically"
11:34
Im an 80's baby..... DOOOPE
Back too. Friggin brilliant over and over again.
i currently own WELL over 100 acres of land only a few miles outside of phoenix. what do you think that means to me? nothing but a tax headache. to any nagger who thinks owning land automatically is awesome. MOST land in the US is worthless. your mule would have ended up being worth more.
"Every time I watch this I notice a new double, triple, quadruple entendre or something or something I didnt notice before"
Ok Im here a month later watching again anyone else ? That drake line was diabolical had to hear it again lol
You will find mysterious information about NFL games in this video. https://youtu.be/CAaaMx2dE9w?si=qOSlrAp7NpiLxMPD
Back at it again..
Watching this for like the 20'th time while waiting for the total lunar eclipse
K dot 5:22
How is there only 130 mil? Its been blowing up everywhere it needs more views lol
"I have listened this so many times , that I know the lyrics & the dance moves and I am a 60th old rock & rolla"
Childish Gambino x j Cole for the next half time
On 3.14 day
This is aging like wine
For me......this was one of the greatest halftime shows I've seen in a loooong time.
This is America
JUST PAST KATY PERRY
I'm not tired of this yet!
Welp im here again
Thats the way Im asking for mustarrrrdddd from now on
Drake was like I love the Super Bowl Kendrick Lamar performance sing not like
OMG
seidoreiku
10:41
say drake
"Kendrick Crushed or ""Drake """
This video currently has 103 million views. And Im proud to say Im at least a good 23 of them. With more to Come. Kendrick did his thing on this one!
We need Kendrick Next year. NFL. And NBA
0:30
This is about his friend and his xs
Great cinematic choreography movements by Kendrick Lamar and his team
"0:20 Uncle Sam's first appearance 0:31 Bodies 1:34 Squabble Up 2:48 Uncle Sam's 2nd appearance 3:04 Humble 4:08 DNA 4:43 Euphoria 5:27 Man in the Garden 6:01 Uncle Sam's 3rd appearance 6:10 Peekaboo 6:59 ""yeah that song"" 7:25 Luther 8:29 All the Stars 9:49 Uncle Sam's final appearance 9:57 teasing THE song 10:17 Not like Us 11:28 Serena's shot at Drake 11:45 TV Off"
Listen to this with headphones. The sound mixing is excellent especially for a live stadium event.
"imagine hearing a whole stadium screaming ""a minorrrr"" at you"
This marks the end of drake
"Starts it over, again!"
"Love it, love it!"
"Good grief this was already historic at the time, it just goes harder with time, spreading further"
4:45
"Me tooooooo!!! . I've only watched this 100,000,000,000 times already. Smfh."
9:59
Brilliant. <period. Dot. Just amazing.
I cant believe this show really happened. Im back to watch it again
Slay minerrrr and the hey drake their not slow
Dude this is definitely my favorite Super Bowl halftime show so far
It was very nice that KDOT gave his flowers to AzChike. First beautiful verse of PEEKABOO is sung by AzChike. Now this voice is IMMORTAL. 133.5 million listened live and 103 Million in UTUBE and counting.Thank you Kendrick. Go forward and stay humble AzChike.
Watching this again better each time I watch
WHY KENDRICK LAMAR SOUNDED LIKE KEVIN HART
"I'm back for the 12,465,353 time lol"
Its March. And here I am. They talking about bots and Im on my fifty-eleventh time watching this!! lol
Wonder anyone noticed that KDOT put his arm on MUSTARRRDs shoulder on his arrival and held it for few seconds before he started his lines. This was to give him the strength and the confidence in this massive stage. I noticed that Taylor Swift does this with almost all the Younger Guest artists on stage. Thats pure love.
"Back again, howwld ohnnn."
"Can't stop watching, this is my 20th time, or is it the 40th...Kendrick is in a master class of his own."
"This is the most replayable half time show ever, like nothing comes close to the creativity and secrets of this performance"
Be humble
humble
Kinda sad that a song about hating someone is something that people valueno wonder America going to the dogs
Kendrick Lamar Super Bowl performance was awesome.
"this was the 1st halftime show I've watched, and I've actually enjoyed it lol"
The stages look like they advertising the PlayStation
I love you SZA so much and Kendrick so much
so cool
Kendrick on TOP

Sza sound better live and she a 10/10 on the CD. Wow a generational talent

I will never understand how Not Like Us was a hit. Euphoria was far superior.
Mussssssstaaaaaaard!
"I am a 71 year old black woman who has NEVER liked rap music. Please do not come for me BUT, this guy...I get him and his music! I might even start listening to more of his music. He has a message for real!"

"No matter how bad of a day I'm having, this puts me in a great mood every time."
"103,471,141 views, and I'm responsible for 80% of them."
I swear every time i come here looking for a specific section but I hear the opening and magically watch the whole thing through
I cannot get over how awesome this sounds. I just listened to the bodies part on repeat a few times. The way it sounds is just amazing. He starts acapella and eases in the string and drums till the bass drop with those double claps. This is not just a instrumental back track playing. Whoever did the sound engineering on this is on another level.
"one month ago and it's the 7th most viewed video on the channel... new retort for all the ""worst halftime ever"" spouters lmao"
fraaaco
6:58 hinted not like us 10:00 not like us
This was EPIC and ICONIC on all levels
"I cant stop watching this, the choreography is Awesome"
Not gonna stop listening to it in a row until it hits 104 million Edit: i didnt know it was gonna go this slow Edit No. 2: Finally I made it now I'm gonna touch grass (not)
"I cant stop listening, ive done listened to it 5 times in a row on repeat, and ive been listening to it so much since it came out"

"WTF is this, non American here how can people even hear this black accented music?"
How many times did you watch ? Yes
NAAAAAAAAA LA ROMPISTE LOCO GRETTINGS FROM ARGENTINA AHRE
March 13th still coming back
"Who would have thought 30 seconds out of a piece that only lasted 90 seconds could create a global phenomenon. Kinda sad that everybody ignores his first three lines, which are the most important. Where's the forty acres? They couldn't even muster a mule."
Over a month since my life changed via football
6:10 real vibe
Mustaaaaaaaard
Me too bro
Help I'm still at the restaurant...
Its really Game over for drake
I think this is my favorite playlist ever.
i have watched this FIFTY LEVEN TIMES!!!
It looks like an accident
Hello. My first time listening to Kendrick Lamar Music. I'M 70 AND IN HOUSTON TEXAS .
"To loud, To reckless, To Ghetto"
"It's been one month, and I'm back again."
"If i had to be honest, id say kendrick lamar is the most inspirational artist of our generation, for me included. everyday he inspires me to keep pushing forward with my music so one day, i might hold my own concerts."
I'm here again.
"Why no diversity on the dancers? No Whites, Asians, etc."
10:11
Mustaaaaasaaaaaaaaaaaaard!!!!!!!
Kendrick is better than 2PAC .
You know its mad when I live in the U.K and I've watched this about 15 times. Drake could move to Mars and Kendrick would be there waiting for him with about 30 unreleased Diss tracks and DJ mustard...
the stadium's noise when they shout MUSTARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD is so perfect
The echo of the concert is still ringing my head on march 13th 2025 lmao
"The way Serena crip walked with so much confidence, drake can't look her in the eye no more"
"Considering Drake's funeral, there is always a Kendrick fan who puts flowers on Drake's tomb every day"
"Great half show but gotta love Kendrick for the smile when he says""say drake"" is absolutely golden"
He is a LEGENDARY.
Bro explain xxxtentaction death
Shorty ilyyyyy
"This dude is wack as fuc# !!! Horrible , dreary voice and just straight up boring songs but hey we live in a world of sheep that all jump on board with what everyone else says"

Ay no way Kendrick said hide your lil sister from him

This is absolutely amazing! Im so impressed with the quality and attention to detail. Its clear a lot of thought and care went into this. Ive had such a positive experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something truly outstanding. Fantastic work all around!
I remember watching this and my parents were so confused! I had to rewatch it to catch everything a really good half time show!
"The half-time show was more interesting than the Super Bowl itself.......next time will come for the half-time show, not Super Bowl"
Hey Drake
10:15 is what you're searching for
you all gonna fix the levels on this video or what
I LOVE MUSTARD ON THE BEAT HOE!
10:20 the beat and his voice turns me on!
TOO GHETTO

I keep coming back. This is actually one of the greatest live performances ever. The breath control and power in his voice is beyond! Slaps so much LIVE even more than on his studio albums which Im now obsessed with. Thank u Kendrick
It has been 31 days. And I am still here.
Woke up looking for that againnnnnn
The fact that I watch this at least twice a week is quite insane. Its that good though.
SZAs voice is incredible.

Still Unpacking This Masterpiece March 13 - Can't Stop Won't Stop
"""yeah that song"""
A smart move by K Dot was to perform his newer music which adds a freshness to the show. It has made it more rewatchable for me.
To be honest I thought when he play not like us we would have another NWA situation with F the police in that one concert when the police ran on The stage
Did anyone besides me notice the intro with the aerial view of Apple music resembled an apple pie? Just thought I'd throw that out there to see what sticks.
"What does Kendricks a pendant on his chain stand for, does anyone know? I never noticed it before."
Sarena 5sec crip Walk stole the entire lime light
"Ndizomana ndiquqa ndibuyelela, emnandi iyaphindwa."
GENIUS
Me too
Replay value goes crazy!

I think I've watched this performance nearly every single day since the SuperBowl. I haven't enjoyed a halftime show this much since Michael Jackson's halftime show. It brings me joy every time I watch it which is why I keep coming back.
12:35 hey drake
Amerikkka commander and a God in the same area! It had to end this way.
Fez histria o Kendrick

"It's midnight and everytime I watch this, it feels like the first time! What level of genius is this???"

Kendrick won!
Any one Indian people
The game over sign was for drake too.

"Whos here in 2075? Im from the future, this is still the best half-time show. You are still awesome"
I literally watch this at least once EVERYDAY! Yes..its THAT good
Who saw the 'Game Over' Glitter at 13:11
Drake gotta leave the planet after this
This will forever go down as one of the Best and most memorable performances! I keep coming back to it
I have never seen someone get destroyed and exposed on such a large scale and never seen anyone enjoy exposing someone like I just watched Kendrick do The Drizzler! I would have wanted to leave the planet after this if it happened to me.

I desperately need kendrick to realse the version of euphoria that has the raspy breaths in the background
Whos here after Spotify just removed 235 million streams from Kendrick & SZA song Luther for irregular botting practices . Drake fans been telling you delusional brainwashed meat riders that youre acting like SHEEP to a liar and pretender. Now he got caught and they took away his views
Im back march 11
I need this level of breath control.
"0:20 Uncle Sam's first appearance 0:31 Bodies 1:34 Squabble Up 2:48 Uncle Sam's 2nd appearance 3:04 Humble 4:08 DNA 4:43 Euphoria 5:27 Man in the Garden 6:01 Uncle Sam's 3rd appearance 6:10 Peekaboo 6:59 ""yeah that song"" 7:25 Luther 8:29 All the Stars 9:49 Uncle Sam's final appearance 9:57 teasing THE song 10:17 Not like Us 11:28 Serena's shot at Drake 11:45 TV Off"

Peekaboos X is a tribute to XXXTENTACION
Kendrick wants to just humiliate Drake in the most funniest ways possible
Absolutely and I didn't like it the 1st time I watched it!!! Now my ALL TIME favorite! There were ao.e pretty nice ones but this is IT!!!!!
"1:54 This mix is HORRIBLE AF, hopefully Kendrick got paid well."
Getting drakes ex is crazy
This is the best Super Bowl Halftime show imo

Memphis Depay -> Vaiiii Corinthinas
I can't stop watching this
I watch this almost every morning while Im getting ready for work
Chills still.
Best super bowl halftime show I've ever seen in my entire life and it had a message that not too many people understood but I did understand it and especially with Samuel l Jackson my favorite actor of all time
Let him cook
Whats the song at 5:34
This comment is probably gonna get lost in the comments section but does anyone know what the intro music/beat is when the Apple logo is shown? Is this from one of Kendricks songs or was it only made for the half time show?
"Anyone noticed Kendrick was wearing a chain that has an a on it, and mustard was wearing a M probably means a-Minorrr"
Plissss.. im addicted with this perform
Name first song?
she is a great model but her album was not as big az her team anticipated
Masterpiece fr
he is an icon
They not like us
"For this to be the ""worse half time show ever"" it sure has a lot of play backs, tic toks, shares, reactions etc"
Euphoria/peekaboo are my favorite parts!
Kendrick Lamar has power moves that no one could have EVER imagined! Im sure there is more to come.and I. Cant. Wait.
anyone in 12th march?
I just keep coming back to this performance bro. I cant wait to see him and Sza live on May
100 million views reached! In just... 1 month!? Amazing!
Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what? BIG AS THE SUPER BOWL
Kendrick is God
"In one of drakes songs he says ""big as the Superbowl"" who's as big as the Superbowl now drake??"
drake gotta stop his career after this
Guess who is back guess who is back guess who is back guess who is back ah ah ah a a a

"Well...... Here I am again, one month later"
"I hope some of yall know, some verses from your favorite rappers, are taken from my favorite rappers who are no longer with us."
Did he say certified FAAAAN LOL
0:54 Now I see why cops check if your truck is locked
Cemetery Lottery older bro name Target Tara chassagne is girl I know Zoe life I'm god
Looking back ... The sound mixing was pretty flat. Then again maybe thats whats happens when you dont lip sync
Still obsessed with this
#chills
"I love the verse that goes, pudabatoo sholakatoo brown berry a fo, chicki can too, person a fool tuka musa fo, legendary a ko, eat up a po, so la kadu"
Samuel L Jackson is totally legend. what a perfomance
Im back here again
who still watch this?
10:05
did someone check on drake?
Who else came here just to watch drake's funeral?
so fake singers... playback spitted in your face...
"A hundred views later, it settles down that this halftime show was for HISTORY"
Is him grabbing his jacket the only dance move he knows? I cant believe I wasted time w this
Pure perfection.
Ctfu drake thought he was safe
Starting my day off with King Kendrick Lamar and #Kenfolk as usual. Are we all ready for the #GNX stadium tour starting April 2025 ? SZA confirmed its going so fun and amazing Get your tickets NOW...... buy #GNX its a 10/10 album And stream everything #Kdot dropped in 2024 . Weve got a point to prove. Keep running this mf UUUPPPPP On the road to 200 million views.
Not Like Us/Drake r.i.p in 9:57
Boring song
Shyt is
"I don't know how many times I've watched this. Back again today, still getting chills!"
Back
The best Super Bowl performance of all time! Nothing comes close.
Here again hello everyone
5+5 on the hat?
I'm just noticing that his jackets says Lo Blo too!
The walk during Euphoria was hard.
man those Kings on the lightpoles had the best seats in the house
"Anyone else how they how they teased not like us after squabble up. they played the start of the song ""Monk Higgins - I Believe to the Soul"", which is the sample used for not like us."
Dunno why I keep coming here
Im back to this music video again..again and again!
"KDOT SNAPPED, I HAD TO COME WATCH AGAIN CAUSE WHAT"
"""Say Drake"""
"""Say Drake"""
And many thanks Roshwita 'Roselilah' Bacha for your amazing trap sounds!
9:58 Not Like Us
Be Humble. One of the best ever show in History
MUSTARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Whos drake ?
We love you King Kendrick
The best video on YouTube
"Hands down the performance was brilliant, NFL bring K-Dot back to be the first artist to do back-2-back appearances."
"What happened with DEI here, I only see one race amount the dancers, I bet people will complain if this was the other way."
No one can deny that was one of the most incredible performances ever.
Its been one month and IM STILL STUCK HERE!
"Kendricks Opening, the flow and understated depth. Compare that to that drake guy with his eyebrows almost as far apart as his talent compared to Kendrick"
111
the fact that he invited both of drakes exes which is Serene williams and sza
"I do not know who this ""Star"" is and the Music is lame, but the Show looks good. Normally i know every Star at the Halftime Shows, but i have no idea who this guy is. Wishes to all of you from Europe. Samuel L. Jackson and Serena are Stars, but who are the Rest? When you watch all Halftime Shows than i must say this is one of the lamest ones. I see many Videos that peopla are surprised to see Serena. Why? I mean every Year a few Stars show up at the Halftime Shows, why are so many reactions for her at YT?"
Great idea having Samuel Jackson there
I want to know who is the first song please
Im on em tough
Instant Classic!!!! Who still here after SuperBowl
"""Reincarnated with love"""
"10:53 "" I don't want to win,I just wanna see you lose"" -some random people"
11:21
One like one push up
:)
The heat part dead
Nice to see all of you back here again even after 1 month! :D
I can't stopppp k dot..c ya in June at the stadium in maryland...
Kendrick Lamar you would have come to feature the all Africa in this song.
Masterpiece
MAKE HIP-HOP GREAT AGAIN
"I love how he made this show more appealing to those watching on TV and then proceeds to tell us to ""turn this TV off"""
"Great performance, but how can that beat Prince and MJ? Just saying"
I'm actually a Drake fan but this guy ruined it.
I feel like I'm personally responsible for at least a 1k of the views this video gets I hope YouTube doesn't think I'm a bot
it was awesome
"As a passerby just seeing this performance and only heard his songs through others, I didn't think I'd be as invested after the last halftime show hitting my childhood nostalgia. I was only listening to reactions at work, and now watching it is a completely different notion, knowing he would add more layers of meaning visually. Also, that smile when saying 'Hey, Drake' is the cheeky smile that I did not expect he'd do after mentioning people like to sue. Cannot get enough of seeing what this man does next, even as a tourist."
Holy ads
Non ci sta 1 bianco
I cant stop replaying the peekaboo part Hahahahaha
Kendrick is a drug of music
"Coisas de outro mundo "" Kendrick "" amazing ........"
Legends waiting for 10:03
Just hey drake
Great
"Ah shii, here we go again"
Say Drake @10:52 The beginning of Not Like Us is so hot. 10:00 .Cant Fake influence 10:13 His smiles are awesome! 13:08
"The smile at ""Hey, Drake"" at 10:51 is crazy"
10:25 best part bro
10:00
THIS SHOW IS SO EXPENSIVE.
When Logic doing Super Bowl?!
3:06 my favourite
Looping this forever!
"Not only was this halftime fire af WHILE televising ""The Revolution"", it made me go shop for some bell bottoms too bro! I absolutely love my people and how creative we are! ""They not like us"" just as the song says. This will go down as one of the most powerful and greatest halftime shows at the Superbowl. Thank you for this Kendrick!"
100 million views in just 1 Month is crazy. Who's here still watching this performance?
PEEKABOO WE ALL STILL HEREEE
102m views
This was made for a shroom trip
Love it!!!!
Who came back a month later to watch it again
Masterpiece performance!!!!!
I rewatch this almost every day
Just imagine if XXXTenaction was alive he would have dominated Super Bowl halftime
10:40 he smiles and then he says that looking straight at the camera with the most convincing tough guy look ever like he cant wait to beat Drake up (metaphorically or physically or both lol)
I think Kendrik hates Drake
"With ""a"" minor chain around the neck"
Why is SZA lip syncing
Did somebody check on that human rights protestor? We got permanent residents and citizens being rounded up so no one is safe.
These are controversy choas to keep you all fools busy in absolutely irrelevant and hollow thing
Vibe nation!
9:53
Aaaaaand Im back
"""Say Drake"" nahh he's smiling"
Im back beechez!!!!
Month gone by and Im still shivering
The smile at the camera when he says say Drake is gold.

One of the best superbowl games
Kendrick Lamar said breath drake I love it

Okthis is fire not the diss track
This has to be the most awesome Superbowl concert ever performed.
welp im here again for the 50th time (i counted)
Vibe check passes when the crowd yelled A Minor!
No rounds twos at Round 6
11:26 Kendrick legit signals the camera they need to switch to Serena. Wants to make sure she gets her shine And boy did it pay off They both might be more famous for this halftime show than their accolades
"For non-black minorities it must be so disappointing to watch an all-black dance crew, no latinos, no asians...nothing. when the BLM movements came about, everyone thought it was a about true diversity, shining the light on all minorities and giving them all more space. Now, black community only looking out for themselves, exactly what they blame the white community for doing. So disappointing."
Does anyone know what song plays at the start from 0:00 to 0:15?
heyyy Drake
Yea this my 22cd time since it dropped
Next up 2026 world cup
"Stupid music, worst show ever."

Wonderful excellent creativity
Bro don't care to get sued

It's the dancers with the message they were soooooo on point every dance. AWESOME JUST AWESOME
Kendrick is an absolute genius wtf
Goat
Wow just wow
Ive watched this halftime show about 50 times since it aired and I still dont understand why some people dont think this was the best. KENDRICK DID HIS THING just like every other artist that has been asked to perform. This is my favorite halftime show ever and honestly one of all time best half time shows ever!!!
So hello back again
FR TURN THIS TV --_ OFFFFFFFF _----
People who is here and dose not even play football ball
"Okay, okay. Just ONE MORE TIME I'm watching this ONE MORE TIME I'm done, frrr this time"
Historic!
10:00 is fire fr
BACK HERE AGAIN I LOVE KENDRICK
Obsessed
Mr Duckworth.
This halftime show was so terrible that I keep coming back to watch it over and over again every few days.
I wish 2 see it live in America one day
Me looking for that one comment that has the songs timestamps:
Are we not going to talk about the lights at the end spelling GAME OVER!!!
Wow this was boring
"Yall see the hood. Boys gigging, thats Bay Area all dayyyY !! Sheshhh!!!"
this is absolutely ART
12:33 they talk about it I did it
These comments bring me joy fr
What song is he singing at the beginning
10:02
This halftime show is bigger than the super bowl. Shows how irrelevant american football is
"I keep listening to find what's the thing that's special about his song except the B WALK and they don't like us ! I really found nothing? Can you guys please enlighten me ,maybe I've lost something's!!"
is this the best music industry in the world? I am disappointed
"For an international listener ! I'd say that's just normal and sometimes non musical neither artistic thing ! Just the music and the vibes are good but since when rap became just speaking to be honest I've never took a side for both him and or drake , I hate both of their songs !!! Honestly,I'm keen on a time where there'd be someone like PAC or Biggie or even Em or jayz what the heck happend to rap from a real stories shared with true stuff to just a Hocking for a rym by the only and big master DRE ! Let's be honest guys all we love about that song is the DRE ingeneries"
Love you
I can't get enough of this OMG
Whos back here after 1 Month ?
"10:53 I just noticed what the dancers did when he said ""I know you like em young."" Wow."
i hear you like em young
ALL THE STARS
10:00

11:20
Greatest Halftime show of all time
Bro dont give a living f- about getting sued i was only here to hear not like us

"So all the people saying it was boring & he should have sung more popular songs, I think the 100 million ppl would beg to differ! And thats a 100 mill in 3 wks, he has just as many views on this video as he had live!"
"Call me crazy, but the entrance of the dancers, it's like a parade for someone important (royalty or soldier) and that's why I'll just say, WAKANDA FOREVER!"
9:57 I like it
Kendrick you did it. It's televised.
Serena even being here and Crip Walking is Diabolical Genius
"This is the second best half-time show ever next to Prince, he will be my number one performance ever"
The GOAT

3:08 que musica essa ? Nome?
The worst performance ever
Was that Serena crip walking???
Alguem sabe a musica .
E esa musica de pirar
You gotta understand why there wasnt a lot of cheering for most of the show. Halftimes are supposed to be energetic. Theyre supposed to get people up and dancing. Theyre supposed to be peppy. Kendrick took a different approach. He made a message. A lot of them. There was so much symbolism this year that so many people dont know about and others do. Best of all time.
"Si tu viens de la Cte d'Ivoire, like on va se compter"
One of my biggest flexes ever is I got a kiss on the cheek and a hug from SZA when she was in Brisbane as I was working with her and her security lmaoooo. Ive also worked with Kendrick and him and his seccys are mad lads
3:41 bro became Donald duck
THE BEST SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW :D
Crazyyyyyyy..... Just crazy.. dont mess with someone who has had a hard life
Drake turned his Tv off
LETS GET IT TO 300 MILLION VIEWS
I KEEP WATCHING THIS
at 12:30 you can see the protester getting jumped by security
that grin on his face and stare at the camera when he drops the drake bar is PRICELESS
Replay king!

wow
KEREN MAS KENDRICK
101m in one month

This wont age well surely jayz hired Kendrick to make fun of drake and his pred buddies to take heat off himself and his best friend diddy he could have hired a good performer Tylers album roll out was fire Sabrina has been fire so many great artist around that time bubbling but he choose to platform hate. Wont be surprised if he somehow gets charged with something diddy related.
100M in 1 month who is here
Kendrick is The Standard
"Came here to escape the headlines about greedy, power high sociopaths. Art is healing. We're gonna be alright."

"The impact of the song ""Not Like Us"" has spread to countries around the world. Kendrick has become a living legend, and his performance at the Super Bowl is the clearest evidence of this. Kendricks iconic Super Bowl performance is akin to Messi winning the World Cup."

Kendrick did 100mill in a month that took other artists years to achieve n they more popular than him. imagine the numbers after 1 year. . Kendrick has reminded us that hiphop culture runs the world n shown white people that hiphop runs the world Even the dre performance is massive n only kendrick will surpass those numbers n do half a billion or more by end year Kendrick is undeniably the GOAT OF HIPHOP... Even nas doesn't come close coz kendrick has achieved what he couldn't.. pure hiphop with large numbers katy perry - 103mill The weekend-79mill.. usher-30mill lady gaga-80mill maroon 5-22mill Justin timberlake-18mill

"Sza, Peekaboo, & those 4 pretty girls ... with the red and black hair keeps bringing me back !!"
There you go Drake there goes Kendrick's uncle
Completely brilliant
The Greatest
"Worst halftime show ever I miss those days when singers like Michael Jackson did the show Those were real artists. And why this discrimination? Only black people on stage? Whats the message? Im mixed race, and i dont get why we can not reach equality? There is no white or black, just people come on!"
I really wanted him to diss the losing team.
Government cheese is crazy
Lamar Jackson 2025 theme song!
Hear this in my sleep
Anyone else keep coming back.
100 million views in just 3 weeks
NFL please this turn this tv off crazy to drake
11:20 all the sudden the whole stadium said A minor like that
11:21 A MINOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!
The worst Performance during a Super Bowl
Keeping up the tradition of just coming back here at least once every day
"The entire crowd hitting the ""A MINORRRRRR"" is *everything* to me lmao"
I here again!!
"I cannot stop watching this performance! Im old enough to remember when rap first came out and have been a huge fan of the genre ever since. But it lost its grit for a lotta years when the industry just started releasing cookie cutter versions they thought would make them profits. Havent heard anything like Lamar since the good old days! I have to say Im starting to think hes possibly the best Ive ever enjoyed listening to. This performance was amazing with the staging, lighting, choreography, camera work, and of course Lamar and his infectious smile Got this old woman up dancing again. Drake must have been so devastated because here in Australia, he postponed his concerts which I think hes only starting to catch up on now I think that mans gonna avoid going back to his continent for a few years now Respect Love to you, Lamar! Finally, someone whos got some truth to say to the people again!!"
Yal!!!! Were missing the message
Eish this is fire
100mil in 3weeks is actually insane its on track to be the most watched ever
Awwww...the boot cut jeans

100 million views in less than a month is outrageous Congrats to Kendrick Lamar

Nobody talking about that dance at 6:22
100 million in three weeks yikes Kendrick is the truth
Say drake! Omg bro is insane And all the stadium choiring A-minorrrrr is insane
Im just here to remind everyone that Kendrick needed Drake for his biggest hit ever
As the self-appointed spokesman for #teamdrizzy i will finally admitwe took the L (but Family Matters still a fukknnn classic)
I'm back again
Goat . The pdf leader aka Canadian Karen got whopped on again

Kendrick Lamar performed at the Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans Louisiana
"Who else come back to just check the dances, the smile and mostly the intro"
"Here again , this half time show is so addictive , every time am watching it's like for the first time"
The absolute best Super Bowl halftime show. 100 million view in less than a month says it all. Congratulations Kendrick THE GOAT
Kendrick destroyed Drake

"Wicked concept to talk about the system and the game controlling. the controller being the SHITSTEM! How from HISTORY to-date BLACK PEOPLE mis-treated, even though ameriKKKa was built off the backs of SLAVES. Slaves like Drake play the game to fit in and stay rich off of mocking and showing a narrative he didn't grow up in or tells false lies! WELL DONE BROTHA KENDRICK!!!"

Kendrick thoughts after they not like us: IT NOT ENOUGH
It's ashame the first thing I wanted to see this morning when I woke up was Kendrick Lamar Superbowl proformance I've seen this over 200 times and counting and still find it exciting. For some reason it hypes the start of my day.
Hey drake- i see you like your young ...
"100 a milli a milli, a milli, a milli!"
"I never jumped on a bandwagon. I have said since 2009 that I hated Drake. I thought that he was the reason hip-hop went down the drain. It was like every single song sounds exactly the same hip-hop is not the same anymore. I hate it 90s hip-hop early 2000s it was the best time to grow up because it was the best time in music hip-hop and R&B Kendrick Lamar Lamar, Young Dolph along with a select very few are an exception this is just my opinion obviously"
KENDRICK ATE
3/2025 30 times watching
"100M! that's what I'm talking about, THE GOAT, THE GOAT!!"

The smile when he says say drake, now what my 10yr old does everytime he sings this part of the song. 10:53 This wasnt just a show, lessons, and symbols everywhere for the educated thatbknows the crises the country is in. the N**i symbol dancers fell in, the stage lights one in the crowd, Samuel J wording and symbol.

Drake should just move to Europe at this point.
Best ever
It's almost at 100M already
Here again cause this is fire
"Kendrick be like-just step this way,step that way."
Drake is going into retirement with this one
So close to 100M he deserves it
This was Drake trying to destroy Kenny like he did to Meek! I'm so proud of you for protecting your family and integrity!
I believe that people that dont know who Kendrick Lamar is havent really seen this halftime show. I believe if they took the time to see it they would be impressed.
Back again
Man! I'm obssesed with the dancers! They're so amazing!
West Coast

2:55 hes referring to Lamar Jackson he better get to the superbowl this year or his goose is cooked
"Everyone must be judged, but this time God only favoring us"
Wish Kendrick wouldve performed with a live band. It wouldve been 10x better
Going on 100 million the hate doesnt even matter anymore
The national football league welcomes you to the Apple Music Super Bowl 59 halftime show !!!!!! The world - passes out SALUTATIONS !!!!!!!!!! Ok lets get Not Like Us On Broadway please
"I wish Kenderick would come out with the Superbowl rendition of his songs. My family needs the clean version. I can't do the others.amd they need to consider this when making music. He caught more attention with clean, meaning no cussing"
Bro waited his whole life for the Drake diss
"I'm sure you're watching this for 5th time , Thank you"
Turn this tv off woooo
Best to ever do it
Kendrick Lamar is a legendary
My daily dose!!!
I didn't know what the halftime show was due to k-dot now I know
"Great choice, Apple and NFL. This was definitely the best Superbowl halftime show I've seen in years! Adding Samuel L. Jackson was a brilliant touch. The choreography was so crisp. SZA's vocals and her chemistry with Kendrick was impeccable. Humble and The Man At The Garden parts were absolutely my favorite, but They Not Like Us was fun. I got so hyped when Serena came out c-walking!"
Its just nice to hear sza in this show with proper audio
"The fact that this kicks off with ""The Old Guard Is Dead"" will forever give me goosebumps"
Iloveyou tinjulie

Some one tag me when we hit 100million views
Team Drake
old white people:

"Think Im going to purchase Youtube premium, just so I can watch this without ads!"
For that 'Hey Drake' 10:52
The genuine smile kendrick had when mentioning Drake
100 mill incoming ......and they said this performance was boring
Cool performance no matter how many times I see it. This performance is the reason why I love Kendrick Lamar. I fell in love with Kendrick Lamar
"Tem na Lacoste, tem na Lacoste"
Kendrick big fan from Nepal
Hhhhh anyone here with me because that's music is the best man
How did sza un dye her hair that fast
Red hair guy is cute and a great dancer.
I felt in love with his jeans
How is the NFL going to beat the numbers next year?
"I'm very late to this. Lost interest in rap when drill music and auto tune became a thing. However, as a poet, former performer, and someone raised in ""the ghetto,"" I find this immensely artistic and impactful in profound ways that will have ripple effects for decades to come. This show will be a module for university cousre study one day. Mark my words."
"Me encanta esta presentacin , la escucho todos los das y su cd tambn . Recin lo conozco"
"Kendrick has a great smile, but he uses it for dastardly deeds. -Josh Johnson"
Turn this tv off I love it
kendrick lamar is the goat\ no cap kl pls commment backjk
"They all brought it so hard! The dancers, oh my goodness. So impressive. You do deserve it all. Like he said, ""We came here from Compton, CA to party with you!"" Look at how happy Mustard is! It's all love. This show was so entertaining and they really came correct."
I dont know how I got so many views in three weeks
"She let somebody to be in her another one like how the alien and then I dont know her name, but"
Hey Drake

Kendrick Lamar is not to underrated he's official
Kendrick Lamar Hooray
0:23 its your uncle sam
Eagles are the best teams ever in super bowl champions 2025 Congratulations Philadelphia eagles
I love how Kendrick dont say the cuss words when he talks
Whos here at 100 mill
10:52 say drake
I loved it! Sza in it too
10:16
This is a work of art
I love how how he avoids eye contact until he starts dissing drake with a big smile on his face too
"that gesture when he said ""LIKE EM YOUNG"" means related with the height? crazy"
"The more I re-watch, the better it gets. Whole performance was a masterpiece"
The way he censored himself made me laugh idk why
This guy has no chill
"Its hilarious how he says hey Drake, I hear you like Im young"
Them adding ads on this should be illegal
12:43 what is mustard doing back there
Kendrick murdered this performance! Shout out to PG Lang and everyone involved in the production. Thank you for doing this for the CULTURE. This was for US. History was made.
10:03 You know that's what you're here for.
5:28 I need the full version.. lowkey my favorite part of the halftime show
"""How many times have you watc..."" ""YESSSSSS"""
I think Ive watched this 50 times
"Bro, the moment i heard the not like us beat, i jumped out of my chair in excitement"
Finesse a nono
100 mil in 3 weeks!!
Still get goosebumps on 3/7
speech less
Can you imagine what the view count would be if rewinds was counted? I can't just watch it once straight through. Multiple rewinds
Almost at 100 million is crazy but its Kendrick!!
Congrats for 100 million
Here I am at 8am on my 8th rotation
I like it 7:28
God bless our hearts.
He got his black grand national
Thank you Kendrick
Im addicted to this performance brooooo its unhealthy
The best halftime show because a diss being 1 hit winning five Grammys and the crowd singing along while screaming a minor is just beautiful
I love how the fans singing that diss track of drake
"people views are sitting at 99,088,647 on Saturday the 10th Mars . round this up to 100 millions by Monday please"
"Once again, Im back for the 1000th time"
What was he thinking wearing bell bottoms
Drizzy: As big as da wah? Big as the Super Bowl Kendrick: yes
9:57 is the real reason we came here youre welcome
6:13
My favorite part 10:05
"anyone know what the beat at the very beginning, before the show starts while it's still showing the apple music logo is from?"
Hey Drake...
Bro Kendrick dissed drake sooo bad 12:11
Peekaboo
"I take substance over citizenship anyway. F Drake, Bieber etc, give me quality, might be trite, but Lightfoot, Rush"
100m Mark
Thank you
GAME OVER
"This was the Best halftime ever! Prince second, even though I admired him greatly."
"Was Fabulous, Lamar looked Fabulous in those jeans"
3:12 I love how Travis is headbanging there
so underwhelming but I'm not surprised.
Should hit 100Ms on March 9th 1 month later
Almost at 100 million views
March 2045 Anyone?
Came at 9Ms... now we at 99Ms
"The more I watch this video, higher the number of ads I get"
Here before 100M
"""Certified loverboy, certified aaaaaah"" is worse than the actual word, the imagery that creates is nasty work."
Impeccable
Bro Kendrick is slaying
"Just realised how many rappers would have struggled with 13mins of performance without swearing, using profanity and the N-word. The energy of this setlist at the superbowl, as amazing as it was (for me), would easily be upped a million times at a concert free of censorship."
Here before 100M one last time!
Best halftime show ever I cant stop watching this
I gotta come back to this at least once a week.
Here before 1 Mill!!!
I'm still here waiting for it to reach 100million views

"Hey, looks impressive My goal is *only* to create WhatsApp groups with lots of users (1000+), will I need to warm up my WhatsApp account for this purpose too? Am I at risk of being blocked? I would appreciate it if you could elaborate more on this please. Thanks in advance"
Kendrick is so kind cuz he knew there were kids there so he didn't say cuss words
The fact kendrick got a a chain and mustard got a M chain Kendrick chain is for a Mustard chain is M for Minor put that both together = A Minor

Kendrick King
Goosebumps

Wow!!!!......What a perfomance
WTF was that
"I normally prefer more production, but somehow I really loved this one, I wasnt even a fan of him lol"
"This has to be one of the greatest, most replayable halftime show I've ever seen. Kendrick is incredible"
10:10
Ive watched this Super Bowl halftime probably 20 times and it still doesnt get old.
10:25 girls back there doing prince of Egypt dance from huligo hair
The sheer amount of blocking he had to remember WHILE also performing is insane... and he did it flawlessly.
Its the longest funeral ever
"when your vibing so hard to this and an AD pops up , like wtf?"
"You know, im the whitest white man to ever be white. I do though love this half time show and im going to show my kids this in the future. Its so amazing."
Almost 100 mil in less than a month is crazy work
"""I didn't point down enough, today, I show you I learned from those mistakes"" we get it Kendrick you are crip walking on a corpse at this point (keep going pls)"
I love the nfl I watch every game even if its not my team

"Certeza que o Chris Brown pararia a NFL, leva o cara!"

Worst halftime show!!
"PRINCE was still better! Can u make it rain harder! Let Miley Cyrus rock some covers at the halftime show, it would be EPIC!"
Kenley Lamar I love you Kendrick Lamar. Youre the best singer ever. Thank you for performing the Kendrick Lamar song in the Super Bowl
Kendrick dissed Drake ans Cole for Clout. Cole ignored and Drake took the bait and responded. Drake should have just ignored and not respond. Kendrick would have been irrelevant as he was.
Well I'm back
I literally have lost count of how many times Ive watched Drakes funeral.
100 M coming soon
Get DOWN HOMEBOY
Wow..
10:54 hey drake (smile)
How could you not love this? People are freaking weird

Back here again eye lol
I feel bad for drake
.. !!! ... ...
I'm here again.
Insane. Homicide on national television. Uncle Sam was replying back to Drake when he asked where Kendricks uncle was so he could talk to the man of the house
I love Kendrick and all but I really wish we could've had MJ's halftime show in 8K. The king of pop's performances and shows were just on another plane.
When I think about the 2025 Super Bowl I wont be able to tell you who played.
This felt like an actual concert
White peoples I dont understand English
"pure genius dude, the american flags the game controller the everything was pieced so well."
Some art changes the world. This performance did that.
This will never get old!
Back in March 2025
Brooooooo I thought only Drake's car can pop out that many boys and girls.
Kendrick pronounces SWORD as SWARD. Look up the meaning of SWARD. Ladies and gentlemen we are in the presence of a very intelligent man. Kendrick is not of this world. Amazing!!
10:10 is Not Like Us
Sea was so weird in the Super Bowl Kendricks better
almost 1Billiooooo
beef with kendrick
"When John Wick was little and didn't want to eat his vegetables, his mom told him that if he didn't, Kendrick Lamar would come for him"

"Ive been listening to this on repeat so much that when my husband annoyed me today, I said under my breath.Bump him and his mama."
Everyone screaming A minor in the stadium proves how good Kendrick Lamar is
He literally told America turn the game off Im done here lol
"The level of talent, of precision, of synchronization- from start to finish is insane. The choreography, the camera work, the costume design, the visual effects, Samuel Jackson, Sza, Serena, AND hearing Kendrick Lamar for the first time Im in awe of this entire performance."
"She sings better than Bigot Beyonce!!!!!!! THIS is real talent. She sings like an Angel. Best 1/2 ti,e show!!!"
It gets better everytime
Gets better every single time you watch it
Let me hear u say
"Cant get enough of this performance, amazing!"
"Vim registrar minha assistida ""bot"" do dia huahuahua Huahuahua"

"I dunno who was hurt more, Drake or white boomers"
Why tf they have sam Jack there when kdot dissed him
That's look fun
"The devious smile at the camera when he said 'Hey Drake's was so funny Drake's not only just lost the battle, he's also lost the war"
Is good
GAME OVER
Drakes funeral
The crowd chants 'Minooooor'

Worst Super Bowl game imaginable but yet here I am yet again for Kendricks halftime show (especially his second half of it).
Its ridiculous how much better the sound quality is on the playback vs the network channel. Enjoyed revisiting this show :)
That intro flow on top of the carA true lyricist!!!! I love to watch this is my truck bc the bass is insane!!!
Peek a Boo
"Easily the best hip hop performance of all time!! If Dr. Dres was the celebration of Hip Hop, Kendricks is the essence of Hip Hop (lyrical, competitive, cool)"
9:50 if you come from tiktok
!
The players in the locker room: ???
10:52 nah bro been waiting for this
Y'all didn't know when he said A MINORRRR the actors were shapes that spelled M I N O R while the camera was zoomed out... He's on a crazy level
5:27 and then you realize that an eagles fan died from a lightpost
My show is back on
I love the slow motion walk at start of DNA and then at the end of it they holding each other and swaying I love this
The X at the 30 yard line
The crowd couldnt say a minorrrrr heck same here lol
"10:52 ""SAY DRAKE!!!!"" Just two words and a smile made Drake died on the inside knowing there's no coming back from this ever."
He really turned drake into a song
The crowd couldnt say a minorrrrr heck same here lol
"March 2025, anyone?"

Broooow toppp
"You know what really got me about this. It's the first time I seen it. I heard so many people complaining about it. It's not the first time. But this will be the first time I say this. If you're complaining about it cuz you didn't understand, the message. Why would you complain unless you notice that there's a message. It's like somebody sending a message in Morse code. Your complaining about the person sending a message in Morris Cole. By nobody know what Morse code is they can see a bunch of beeping. You're complaining cuz you know there's a cold. You know what the beeping means."
Drake turned his tv off
Not mustard making his legendary appearance

Drakes watching this with smoke coming out of his ears

"""BIG AS THE WHAT???"""

Best super bowl performance ever!!
"Okay I've had to watch this everyday, such a good show"
"Drake got dissed not only Kendrick's diss tracks totally burned him but Kendrick lit used uncle Sam (Drake dissed him with his uncle on one song), used drake's ex gf as a dancer in one of the songs with SZA and lit sang not like us"
"i can see why the only clip thats being thrown about is either the TNLU clips, or Serena Cripwalkin.. coz the rest is seriously boring AF"
Upvote this if you're waiting for it to hit 100 Million
5:24 even the adlibs got pyro mannnnnn
"""40 acres and a mule, this is bigger than the music. They tried to rig the game, but you cant fake influence."" Almost a month later, this is the first and only halftime performance (and, for that matter, one of few musical pieces at all) that I continue to think about. The ""Uncle Sam"" is genious. Not to mention how epic that ""Say Drake"" is... followed by thousands echoing that ""A miiiinooooorrrrr."""
10:53 is when he said say drake 11:18 is Tryna strick a chord it's prob a minor 11:28 is Serena crip walking 11:53 is mustard
I have come back here so many times
Every corner of the world vibing with kendrick
WOW
Im a huge Kendrick fan and have been since TPAB but he made his performance worse focusing on the Drake beef. Wayne shouldve gotten the Super Bowl since he cares bout Football and is an Orleans legend. I havent listened to drake since like 2013 because its generic radio music.
Idk why but Serena c walking just makes me cringe lol
"I will never understand why people go onto something they know they will hate and not only give it views, but also engagement. Like... If I hate a song, I will actively avoid it. Not tell the algorithm ""Hey, give me more like this please"""
Ourstory in the making
The Game Over in the last second is
I don't care what anybody says... this is my favorite halftime show I've ever seen. The planning and execution is perfection. This is art at it's finest.
Whos here after the third time?
1:54 whats it called please
Yup. Still here. Who else?
11:54 MUSTAAAAAAAAAARD
Greatest performance of all time!
Hm @Hozier Too Sweet 12:36
Drone/overhead shots & greattt Offendahl they not like us Chainsmokers they said 12:11
13:21 minutes of one of the greatest bards of our time giving everyone bardic inspiration and casting vicious mockery on drake.
Starry skies. Canyon Moons. chills again and again! Great job Kendrick 10:06
Innnncreble! 8:58
That transition woahhh 7:45
Chills. Epic storytelling. 5:52
"I cant imagine the rehearsals that went on, because everyone was pure perfection."

Hi
Who here again??
King
HAD to come back again
"NFL, I am once again begging you, to please fix the audio on the half time shows. I have been suffering from the terrible audio quality for 8 years with Gaga's performance, but it's even worse to not even be able to hear some of what Kendrick says properly here"
Ok yall im back
- Almost a month later and I still come back every once in a while.
"Almost 100M, 99% it's me."
"Honestly, cancel the SBHT show already, nobody is going to top this and so who is going to see it anyway"
Watching this for the 100th time
Nice
Here we go again!
65 yo female best concert in have ever ever seen

Still listening to it on March 1st
Almost 100 million views. Let's get it
7:45
People really glazing this dude. You got low standards if you found this entertaining.
"Good morning my morning anthem,"
Im back -----AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I come here everyday to re-watch this! On our way to a 100 milli views!!
ART
You censor PDF but don't censor the whole crowd yelling A MINOR Drakes so cooked
Im a huge Drake fan but I have to admit this is a great Super Bowl halftime show and not like us is a pretty good song
And I'm STILL TF here
Im back again part 100
*sigh* Here in the morning too
"For the 1000th time, Im back!! This was a MOVIE!!!"
Theres a reason why that car is on a stand like thing. The people are coming from under the stage
Here before 100 million
Wonder how Drake's doing
coated

"This a major mark, and I hope K. Dot goes crazier in the upcoming year!"
"""bro shook the world I think this is the best of the song of the century"""

They used Kai's scream at 2:37
Back again for my dose of this genius. Can't get enough
Waiting for the essays that will be written about this performance
Vinyl?

Wow

Latest

Kendrick the genious
"""say drake"" was legendary"
"This has been on trending for almost a month now. Its going to fall off eventually, but its probably going to be a while especially if this hits 100M (lets be real it will happen before next week.) But in theory, it if you factor in Spotify listens (yes this whole show is on Spotify too) there has been well over 100M listens already."
There is a superbowl between the concert
At some point I will move on from this video...
Im back again Ill never stop coming back
Im back. 3 million more views
Is no one gonna talk about how good SZAs performance was
I guess im the only one who doesnt appreciate this. He style changed. Except the ones with SZA Every song he performed had the same vibe. The Kendrick i knew back then is different from this one. SZA's voice is beautiful.
Halan be humble sit down halan be humble sitdown
Must be fun to make money pretending to do something
TV off - the perfect outro
im on loop
1:19
Wish mustard had more screen time
5:59
"Heavenly father I pray you keep the person thats reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed Amen"
I'm obsessed
I'm going to see Kendrick-SZA in July watching this halftime show again and again just makes me even more excited
Ok listen to that one person say <mY FrIENd> at 11:31
Love
I can't even count how many I rewatch this
America is so racist 99%of the show was black
11:20
Khualalven like kids
Reincarnated with Love
Vengo despues de entender el chisme
09:58
Cheap jeans
Drake is still in Australia
"Wow i finally understand what all the hype is with kendrick. This is one of the most fascinating and Supreme displays of human passion and spirit i have seen, especially in the realm of coregrapged group dance performances which i don't typically have most taste for almost ever, but in this case it was the secret glue that holds the ship together"
King Lamar!
"I heard ""Hey drake,I know you like em young"""
Love it!!! I would love to be there one day!! Its d biggest show EVA!!!!
100 mil in less than a month
"As asians, we love our King Kendrick"
i was so scared to finish thissss i want it to last forevaaaaa
Haters go to
This has to be the best Superbowl halftime show ever.
This is the greatest beef that camee after big v pac and em v the source
rewatching 7th time
100M soon
I can't stop coming back to this!. This was FIRE!!!
MUSTARRDDDDDD
Everybody that say this aint lit needs to SIT TF DOWN AND BE HUMBLE!
This was the best half time show ever
Bro got thousands of Cams Zooming at him
"I'm unfortunatle starting to believe that everything that I've heard about this not being a good halftime preformance is part of this negative view media throw. It seems like everything this year has to be just absolutely terrible and we can't just let good stuff be good. There HAS to be a negative/it can't truly be good.(Edit:The way the crowd screamed ""A Minor"" lets me know this is just bad media)"
Now a Rotten Beff
The dance moves going viral with the song is out of this world
And were back
"Wait, I didn't get it.. is that dee halftime show? Dang..."
A bummer to those who aren't fans of nog music.
Waiting for 100mil views
It's official... I'm obssessed....
"the smile, THE SMILE knjsndhdhdj"
And I'm back again...sorry Drake.
Drake and pdd
Incredible
9:49 Leaving this as my bookmark
Racist
Someone needs to make this with correct captions for them old folk
Thanks Jay-Z. This moment will forever be in the hip hop books.
4:43 whats the crowd say ?
The music & the meaning along with choreography- beyond exceptional
7:08 best part
Genius lamar
I feel like kendrick lamar perform this like a music video because the people new orleans didn't want he to perform there in first place. He was performing for the people at home watching.
Still rewatching
I'm back
I replayed a performance more than this one.
Love how he Raps
Say drake
Say Drake @10:00 you're welcome
Ooo. They improved the audio again since I last watched it yesterday.
3:01 titans mentioned
Wait wait wait! Is that a real GNX he's standing on?
I have watched this about 5 times now and its still gold
Hers the song ===> 10:00
"Every morning when I wake up, I play this just to light up my day..."
Lil wayne would have been better
I appreciate it more now
10:00
Yes I'm still here
Me too!
K Dot Snapped
Didn't watch live but have watched multiple times since. Maybe a greater focus on arts and less on paying men to risk CTE would be cool?
are you my friend?
Say drake
Kendrick need to do Super Bowl again and
"the way kendrick just lets the audience carry out the long drag of A minor is just so beautiful. He KNEW the audience would react like that, and used it to his advantage."
Pov messi in the super bowl: what this???
good boy rawr mommy loves u bbygirl
11:29 the way she looking while
I'm still watching a month later
"Dios, lo veo 3 veces por dia al menos"
The dancers are incredible - Amazing!
Here again
"This is the standard now in rap hip hop beef, f your beef if you're not gonna bring it to this level"
Makes me feel glad I haven't watch the NFL in years...
Theres a choir like tune at 2:51 and I NEED to know where this came from or if it was just part of this halftime show only.
"coming back to this bc I managed to get gnx tickets Im so excited, this tour is abt to be generational"
Can everyone pls think of what people would have thought if this came on BEFORE AND AFTER TV'S
"Great show for any k dot fan. I could see how his more recent beats may not translate well to TV audio though. It's a lot of kick/bass instruments lacking mid & high frequencies accompanied by catchy but repetitive loops and hi hats. The newer prodcution feels minimal, and it forces you to pay attention to his lyrics. Hits harder at a show or with good speakers, but it's a mixed bag on phone/tv speakers imo"
drake is not surviving this one
here's to 100mil views
His pep talk turned into a pep rally.
I'm rewatching a few times in a row to make up for the past few days.
They vibe was pretty good
9:58
10:52 when he looks at the camera is gold
Why was the intro so good????
Wow
this is my 18th time watching this is just so good
THIS IS SO GOOD OMG. THIS IS WHY EVERYONE SHOULD BE ON KENDRICK'S SIDE.
"Saying say, Drake and smiling at the camera is crazy bro really has hatred in his body is not like this is the seventh time"
Yes sir
Back again lol
One of the best creators in the world
A lot of symbolism on this one
Brazilian. Vx
The best Super Bowl halftime I've seen in many years
14.4m subs and 400 views in 50 mins nfl fell off
"Tried to rig the game, but you cant fake influence. They tried it though."
"Here, who watches this more than 20 times and keeps dancing!!!"
The end of amerikkka.
How can they fit more than 30 people in that car oh i see beneath it
Im concerned by how many times I have watched this!
anyone recognize the girl from the Kevin langue video?
"This is the most dope thing Ive ever seen on television! And WE dont care if yall didnt understand it, if it made you mad or whatever! The fact that you hate it means it did exactly what it was intended to do!"
Kendrick got knees for days
Say drake i hit. You like Im young
6:49
"10:02 I'm baaaacccckkk!... 4 ""NOT LIKE US"""
How do I keep coming back!! lol idk it just feels good
I lie i lie..... how could i even imagine leaving out SZA!!! lol by far my favorite female artist in a long long long long time
Its everyone yelling A-Minor
"""40 acers and a mule this is bigger than the music"" is such a bar."
I just wanna be clear though.... my likes and comments are soley for Kendrick.... i think the NFL is a sham
Ohhhh man the hate on this performance is sooo invalid and beyond ridiculous lol. Just looking for a reason... flawless in my opinion
"I love whole production, dancers, story telling and Kendricks power and stamina. I think this is first Superbowl with a big message, not just playing songs everyone knows and fireworks. That is a big achievement and i couldnt be more proud of Kendrick."
"This is the type of music I scour the internet for, to relax after a long day. Finding this playlist feels like striking gold. A true treasure that I can turn to whenever I need to unwind and recharge. The soulful tunes and rhythmic beats create a serene atmosphere that helps me relax and let go of the days stress. Its like having a personal oasis of calm and comfort in the form of music. Thank you for sharing this incredible playlist."
I love it sons in the black one
Esssssss Ayeeeeeee!!! Still Authentic!
Aye dot can i get a drop? NO
Welp... 3 weeks and 535th time today watching this

This is for SZA you have one of my cousin coworkers phone number and thats your cousin. I was just wondering is that actually your cousin because if that is can you please give me your number?
Whoever didnt like this performance is a pure D Hater!!!!!

I think that this is the best halftime super bowl ever
"No no no no nooo Too loud,too reckless,too ghetto."
I don't like this.
Strike a pose part with SZA scratches my brain somehow
CHECKMATE!
He walked Drake straight to his grave . Just brilliant
You just have to love SZA
Didnt even know who Kendrick Lamar was. Think this is the best halftime show.
Kendrick so averaging 1 million views a day.
I had to come back for this musical gold
CLOCKED DRAKES TEA
Back again lol 10:11
They are wearing a and m chains and it stands for a miner
I know everyone was at the Super Bowl just for the Halftime show not the game
Could you imagine if Kendrick had Rihanna on the 1s and 2s
wow este tio es un bestia en el Hip hop
In back here again
HERE I AM AGAIN!! THIS HALFTIME SHOW WAS EV-ERY-THING!!!
drakes ex.....is kendrick
Back again!
Squabble up squabble up squabble up

"It's March 2025. I'm back.,.... Probably will be back until the next Superbowl. Can't get enough of it. CPT all day!!!"
A MINOOOOOOOOOR
Legendary.
97 million views
Kendrick would go on to join Michael Jackson and others in performing at the super bowl without getting help from Satan :)
I watch the show three times a day and I can't get enough of the production. Skip Bayless and Wayne's camp continue to spread the lie that the NFL apologized for not choosing him. A Spokesman for the NFL quickly debunked the rumors.

The Greatest of All Times
How far this was from the superb 1993 Michael Jacksons Super Bowl halftime.
this was the first time I paid attention to the NFL since The Packers won the super bowl (the most recent time) and the way I screamed when I saw Sam Jackson was Uncle Sam omg
this is perfect!
The number of ads in this one video is dumb af
Back here again

My favorite song now
I'm bot
aight we back
Calling out drake not only for being a p e d o but also calling him out for what he most likely did to xxxtentacion in the very start of the performance. ICONIC
"If you stop it at the 11:17 mark, there's 6 brothers sitting on top of the streetlight posts. I wonder what that represent? Hmmmm......"
What the hell is wrong with me? Ive watched this halftime show at least 100 times over the past month and it keeps getting better and better.
Bello
Serena keep walking
Like if youre here again.
They not like me
guess whos back - back again
Something very overrated...... emotions are rather negative....
"Oh?! You thought the money, power, fame would make you get the ? Huh Drake, you thought you could get the Super Bowl? You think you could do this, Drake? 5:09"
The greatest
How can I like something times infinity?
My 6000th time watching gets better every time

11:54
"Greeting from Indonesia , this is adorable performance."
It was dope show but why talk about another man on your time to do you and so what he gone do about the 40 acres and ykur people rights fake let march
"This is my 97th million time watching this family, So don't feel bad,. G.O.A.T!!!!!!!( FACTZ)....."
Chillsss!! 11:20
SZA
The crowd yelling 'A Minorrrrrrrrr' is diabolical
"Sza's voice is so healing, man! It hits different!"

Really awesome
Powerful.
This was terrible! Millennials have to be hyping this up
How do people say this is the worst halftime show ???????!!!?!??!

"Nobody can hate this. Humble, Peekaboo, Not like us, TV off went crazy. The visuals. Luther and All the stars nice touch"
"Ive watched this maybe a hundred times, Best!! Halftime Show Eeeeeeeeeeeeverrrrrrrrrrr!!!"
This video will become the second most popular on NFL channel after Dr. Dre. Maybe after May 5th.
performance so good you didnt even realize how many passengers came out on that car.
"Did you click on the ""newest"" comment button?"
This performance is so addictive

"Everytime i watch this video i think to myself if Kendrick would have projected Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman portrait in that circle as they walked around it..there wouldnt have been a dry eye in the room. Shout out to KDot for the flawless performance."
Greatest ever
Fank
Worst halftime show ever
Portuguese here... The fact that that you don't understand why you missed the mark... Is WHY you missed the mark.
"Why his dancers are only African-American? Where are the white, yellow dancers?) Asian, European, Mexican and so on. Purposely chosen black dancers. Still segregation between people, just stop it please"
I
When a halftime show is so good you think about it when you wake up and you playing it in the car nonstop! Thanks K Dot!
Drake turned his tv off that is all I know
"This was a show, not a concert and kendrick nailed it"
Real hiphop won.
"If this was an election, he definitely won the debate and got my vote"
MUSTARDDDDDDD!!!!!
That TV is still turned off
The intro is insane
Indonesia here
IM back here again
Mustard's entry is iconic

Mustarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd
half time show X fifa world cup 2026 Big as the superball aren't there anymore
I wonder what is the REAL reason who started the beef between those two
The replay value on this is insane... I dont think ive rewatched any superbowl performance as much as this

"I never knew about Kendrick till this videos started popping up everywhere, I think I love him already."
Peekaboo I'm here again
10:02 not like us
"This has got to be one the worst super bowl performances, never skipped so much of it before. Why only put a lad on who's only objective is to talk either about cultural divide, which in a time like these days, we must come more together, then spend the other part dissing Drake, which on a platform like this that was watched worldwide and has many young people who might be influenced, was not ideal."
11:26
My mans shoe size is a 7lol
"3 weeks later, and i still come back to watch every single day since it dropped."
drakes funeral service
Man in the garden went so hard..

"96 Million views in 3 weeks.. this what I gotta do to get that much views in no time? *puts on sunglasses* Im going on the Super Bowl.. Leanerd, pick that pen up and start writing songs! Use your mind like youve never used it before!"
Money Trees could have been sung on the Show

I wish not enough was played for just 2 seconds but it was still perfect
"KENDRICK SET A WHOLE NEW STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE HALFTIME SHOW. JUST WATCH, NEXT YEAR, THE SUPER BOWL PERFORMER WILL TRY TO MIMIC THE GRANDEUR OF KENDRICK'S SHOW."

"Hello, I'm the production team of Running Man, a Korean entertainment program. We would like to use the video as a data screen in our program, so please answer whether it is okay to use it after writing down the source. Thank you."
Having a superbowl performance on my rotation is crazy
Back here for the 86th time

K Dot is sexy af.. a real black man
Breath control is crazy. I've performed before I was out of breath by the 3rd song
So they still going on about this being the worst Super Bowl halftime show? Or did they realize there wrong?
"This is so racist, there's only black people"
100 million views in under a month. You definitely know how to play the game Mr Lamar!
"All the stars is not just a song for us marvel fans it's an anthem and a tribute to our ""BLACK PANTHER"" aka chadwick boseman"
Why there was no white person down there. Only black inclusivity adn what abt whites??
"The best performance i've ever seen, great song, great stage"
"Use THIS COMMENT as a ""I'm still watching this a month later"" button."
Kenny!
forgive me cause i see Coca & Pepsi :)))))))))
classic
Every time I return to watch again views have grown another 10 million
was kinda wack. that show in LA was the last SB Halftime show that was watchable
Let's run it up!!! I can't keep track how many times I keep coming back and watching reactions
Every part of this was AMAZING!!!! I have watched it.I don't know how many times and every other video surrounding it by.People re enacting it and everything and I love every single one of them
"""Head shots for the year, you better walk around like daft punk"""
Its not that bad how is it the worst half time show
"Most viewed clip the NFL channel ever had, and it's mostly to see the world call dude a PDF... THE WORLD LOL. Literally EVERYONE ON THE PLANET said A MINOR in UNISON!! The most influential moment in rap history is saying you're a disgusting freak that likes kids. That TUFF AF for drake"
Still listening still watching
I love this I can watch everyday
"Very fitting that this was the point that most Chiefs fans did, in fact, turn the TV off"
I know I have watched this way too many times and get hyped each time as if it was my first time seeing it
Lip syncing but still loved it

Euphoria was WAY too short.
how can there fit so much talent into such a small man
say drake
I'm from the UK and can honestly say I have never heard any of Kendricks music or really heard of him. And I have to say I know who he is now. That was one of the best performances ive ever seen. Everything from the lyrics to the entire set up. I will definitely remember him now. That was pure fire.
"Es la primera vez que escucho de Kendrick y a pesar que su show fue plano y austero, basado en solo bailarines, disfrut mucho su msica!!! Tiene buen ritmo."
"hey, it's me again"
drakee ex wass dancingg thereee
10:53 is when he starts war
"I cant believe people are looking up how to do this two step. Two step is a dance you have find in the beat, its a default dance you go to. It should have been the dance you were already doing to this song fr. Cant believe people dont know how to do that"

Bro been waiting his howl life 10:53
"Love the new scent! And it still works wonders on my sore muscles. CBDFLEX continues to innovate, and I'm here for it"
Who's here before 100 million views?
"This would be the hardest Super Bowl in history , everything went to plan, no mistakes and such a creative mind."
How do you get an entire crowd to sing one line in a song? Step 1. Be Kendrick Lamar Step 2. Turn Drakes TV off
WILDDDDDDD

Ok I have a problem. This is my 1000th time watching
WOW this was way much better than last year Super Bowl halftime
Oooooommmmmmmggggg
Real art is undeniable; each time I experience something new! Thanks KENDRICK!
Theres zero tangible evidence of drake liking them young. The joke has gone too far. Drake should sue for defamation. Drake doesnt deserve the treatment hes getting. I say this as a fan of neither of them. I say this as an outside observer
Niiiiiiiice

It is a tradition to watch this once in a while.
I watched this about 7 times and only nowI notice the people sitting on top of the light post
"Honestly, after watching the other half-time shows, this was so well calculated, clean, ,TIMELESS story-telling. Camera angles captured everything PERFECTLY compared to the other shows.Seeing Sza do 'all the stars' made me tear up, Kida at a half-time show!, and giving Mustard his flowers!?. This was for black culture, not just entertainment. which speaks of the kind of artist K dot is he did this for the people watching from home. unforgettable."
Say drake
I lost count how many TIMES I watched this! #TeamKDot
"white guy here. black males, as long as they take care of their women, and kids, are the best weapon we have in america. think about it."
"5 march 2025, back at it for the upteenth time."

"Insignificant, but i'm still wondering, whether people realized that the ""Game Over"" in the end (13:13) was because the show was game-themed, not because of Drake"
The only good thing about watching the super bowl halftime
Drake wept.

His smile gets me every single time!! so adorable and unbelievably lethal

"Coming as a 61-year-old white woman who had never listened to his music, I have watched this at least once every day since Super Bowl Sunday. Each time I watch it I find something more interesting and I unravel more of the lyrics. I really appreciate this, he is a great talent"
"Absolutely pulverized the man to nun but dust holy shmoley, that final TV turn off with the entire audience lighting up a game over for drake leaves my jaw hanging every time"
Nos dio: Voz 100% Baile 100% Pose 100% Carisma 100% Drama 100%
"Kendrick was kind bro, imagine him singin Meet the grahams"
"Here I am, for the seventh time STILL loving everything in this performance!"
This will age incredibly well.
Im back here again
11:35 Serena what are you doing here?
list song 0:20 Wacced out murals 0:30 GNX snippet 1:34 Squabble up 3:04 HUMBLE. 4:14 DNA. 4:43 Euphoria 5:28 Man at the garden 6:00 Peekaboo 7:22 Luther 8:29 All The Stars 9:58 Not Like Us 11:45 Tv off

This is the best super bowl half time show I have ever seen. Super sick Kendrick Lamar good form you are on point for sure
10:53 youre welcome
Amazing
Nah the way he said drake with that smile
8th time Ive watched this
"I am from Ukraine and I never listened to Kendrick, nor do I relly dig rap music. But man this performance is an art on so many levels. And you guys let it rot at 100mil views not even able to surpass some hyped stars from 3 years ago? Don't get me wrong, Eminem and Snoop are some top class artists known around the world, but you get your black messiah only once a generation. Is that because everyone is happy in USA or because you guys want it nice and calm? You tell me. I'm gonna up that view count instead of you until you decide"
10:00
i can't imagine how it would feel to get the seats behind kendrick
This video was doing 2 million views per day and only slowing down to 1 million per day now after almost a month.
My favorite show
Its crazy that people try to claim this is the worst half time show ever when you can literally hear the whole crowd singing along the whole time
I have re-watched this many times Bananannanana.
"been back every 6m views started around 22 M, we about to hit 100M."
Im back for the 100th time!
"Never seen a superbowl artist that they making this much videos across all social media especially IG and Tiktok. Usher was great but didnt do this big of impact or rhianna or beyonce. Kendrick did that weather ya like him or not. And still making impact....even the songs that some didnt know, all viral now and the world knows them now. Great show, watched a zillion of timesbeach time so hyped and proud"
"This was absolute cinema the performers, cameramen (hit the angles!), music, storytelling. Can this get a Tony award lol"
Looking to be the 100 millionth to view this amazing project
"I think this will continue to be a daily watch!! Such great energy, 2 lyrical & performative protests in one & a concert; plus all the extras! Best halftime show EVER!! Kdot"
I think Drake needs to turn the tv off
I've re-watched this at least a dozen times since and it still gives me goosebumps. Kendrick is simply awesome!
"I'm back again, guys. I brought snacks!"
I love this
I cant believe that thay brot out Serena Williams
Start watching from the 10 min
Im back to view this masterpiece again
This is my 6th time watching this
9:55 not like us
That first peekaboo when he pops up into frame always cracks me up
Just wow
When he said they love to sue was so true and had to keep it friendly but still made it good
Pretty sure is reaching 150 million views
Mustarddddddddd
I pressed and held the like button for a few seconds. Will that multiply my likes?
. .
This is fire
"I cant stop listening to this Can't deny Kendrick Lamar been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dudes literally unstoppable now."
Here for my weekly view
America has a problem...meanwhile back to the best half-time ever!
I wonder what the good kid from Compton would think if he saw himself now.
Its me againround 100
you win-k dot
This ain't even close to Michael Jackson super bowl. Michael Jackson could have just walked on stage and spit and then walked away and it would have been better
Where's the diversity? I don't see anybody besides black people. That's racist
Beautiful!!! Amazing!!!
This is lame
Everything Kdot does ages like wine lol
Sounds like hes saying Niggs to the back of the bus
"I watched it live. I've rewatched it here a hundred times. Kendrick did his thing! The cameras used, the camera angles, the lighting everything about this performance was fantastic! Special shout out to the ASL interpreters as well (I've watched that video a ton too). To do all this live, I hope they win some kind of award for the production!"
How many dancers were in that car
Best
The amount of times I listen to this is unhealthy
Esto es histrico
It would be awesome if Eminem perform at the next Super Bowl
10:08
I can't wait to get home from work put my feet up and play this while I smoke a spliff. It's already a classic #RIPDrake
"The prophet SPEAKS! Not only has this sent a cosmic reverberation, conquered demonic business and bringing life and light triumphant in music, but what magnificent artistry and power. Theyll be studying this for generations to come"
Still watching in March
Todos os dias assistindo esse espetculo
Kendrick Lamar says say Drake at 10:51
1:21
Nah bro 6:45 I went crazy when bro hit azchik lyrics
ICONIC
World Biggest Funeral
The greatest performer alive
"It just dawned on me, how grateful I should be that I dont have to stress as a mother that one day my kids would be lost to the streets. We need to work better as a country! No mother should worry that their child is in jail/dead because the streets took him!"
"The hat says 5 + 5 as in how many stocks do I really have in stock ay 1,2,3,4,5 plus 5 ay!"
This song is to fire
68 times back here
Let's keep this going worldwide Live baby.. Come on guys keep sharing this let's get it up to 100 million for our boy KENDRICK LAMAR THE GOAT

Time for drake to retire
In the span of 3 weeks I have watched this video over 18 times. Kendrick is an absolute legend.
Still watching this till today!
"No autotune, no face tattoos, no frills, just good old hip-hop"
"Kendrick: Turn this TV off, turn this TV off! Me: Re-watches for the 100th time."
Nipsey and Kobe would be proud
Just here for my weekly revisit Best halftime show EVER!!!
"Anyone else back rewatching and noticed the audio sounds different? More audience cheers in some points, szas part sounds more like she was live singing anyone else notice this?"
"The true winners of the Super Bowl are Sony PlayStation. They put the X, , O and there (I know nothing about american football)"
7:20
"Lol man had the whole Superbowl Show biggin up ""its probably A' minor""! . Say No Fcuking More."
"Fun fact: This halftime show was supposed to have more pyro-technics, they were taken out because the President was there"
Crazy how this is history
Drake is the Best 4 live mans
"Admit it, this isn't the first time you've been back here."
Welcome back. Watching this performance is slowly becoming a tradition.
Almost a month and I still play this everyday
Me too
I don't think there's a soul out there that has watched this more than I have
hes so smart for prioritizing the camerawork and visuals. he was performing for the people watching from home..now this is the most replayable halftime show ever.
"The more times I watch this, the more I enjoy it. Real talk, when I'm working around the house it's my go to music. Every day"

Im back watching again because this was iconic. KDot is so detailed. Its good to meet someone like me. His endurance is legendary. my fav halftime show
10:53 is evil
Peekaboo my favorite
Kendrick Had A Video Game Musical Politics Concert All in one.
People forget that he was also in the superbowl during Eminems halftime. Meaning that this guy is so iconic they had to bring him back for more
Always new.
Bro casually turned the Super Bowl into his concert
Kendrick proves as long as the music is good you dont need to fly around the stadium or where weird clothes to make a good show
I watch this so many dang time a bruh if yall say this wasnt a hit yall hating
Whats up with the gloves . This was awesome
I have listened to/watched this every day since the Super Bowl and it still gives me full body chills. The hidden messages make it so much more than what most people see/hear. He is truly a Revolutionary.

Addicative.
Never heard Lamar before. I literally thought I missed out hearing so much about the show. Very dissappinted. Very boring
"Top of the morning, top of the morning, top of the morning"
The backup dancers tho-
"Trilogia em msica, dhabeisso"
"If you hate this masterpiece piece of work by Kendrick, something is wrong with you."
I'm happy he didn't use Paris G
...
"I love Snoop and Ice Cube. Why I'm any of Kendrick Lamar music on the car radio?. I'm glad I got my phone. My grandchild of ages likes it from 2 years all the way up to me, the grandmother"

"Droga, mano. O cara consegue matar de tantas formas. Samuel Jackson de Tio Sam. SZA cantando parecendo um anjo entre humanos, que mulher maravilhosa. Serena Willians, a maior jogadora de tenis com seu c walk durante Not Like Us sendo ela uma ex namorada de Drake, o sorriso do Kendrick para a cmera. Lendrio!"
Not the S for szaa 7:26
So this is what a Rappers funeral looks like?? R.I.P. Drake
"For those comparing this to 2022: Dre, Snoop, Blige, Eminem, Lamar - >333 million view in 3 YEARS Lamar -> 94 million in 3 WEEKS!! A solo performance pulling these views folks. I LOVE IT!!!"
OVHOES crying saying this was the worst performance ever. Lol this my 5th time watching this. My chick wanted to watch it again last Sunday too .

I keep watching this just for sza in all the stars
this is best super performance ever.
I am surprised he picked sza a singer that sings playback
Beautiful
back here again
"This was very strange. It seemed like a civil rights commentary with some secret society symbology and milataristic dancing. I could only understand about half the words. Is there a transcript? I hear a lot of people saying it was awful, but it was unique and entertaining. I liked Samuel L. Jackson making the comments about how the US treats race. The line about Drake was fire. This needs some cliff notes. I don't agree with all he said, but it was creative and a spectacle."
"keep coming back for the ""Say Drake"""
W
Aight im back back again
"Such a powerful voice, it gives me chills."
Who is drake again? :D
I refuse to let this performance go
BEST HALFTIME SHOW FOR ME
Like a fine wine...
"This is beautiful, its like watching a live stage play."
I cant get over them bell bottoms.

I cant believe mustard was there
Its been 3 weeks but I constantly play this like it dropped yesterday
12:10 no worries youtube is on lol
reminds me of xxxtencion
Drake have been cooked
Ive been a k-dot fan for a while but people saying this was the best halftime show need to take a step back and remember 2022 which also featured him https://youtu.be/gdsUKphmB3Y?feature=shared
Drake: if they none they mine
I watch it everyday!! sometimes multiple times
9:50
? 2
10:55 say drake
LET ME HEAR YOU SAY MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARDD
https://youtu.be/c0VGOhBL9gM KENDRICK LAMAR - NOT LIKE US - KARAOKE
The bodies song is
Best Super Bowl show ever
Oscar trolling drake too
Can we talk about how FIT Kendrick is. Like cardiovascular wise.
soo cooooooooool
Dude taking revenge to another level
7:40 name of the song?
SZA hella gorgeous
"A diss track - wins Grammies, gets a superbowl halftime show, #1 track, gets his brand worldwide recognition, has one of the music industries top 10 trying to sue him over the song which means someone, Im guessing the stenographer , has to type out the whole song with every diss and innuendo and put it in official public and government records and the song brought the west coast gangs together in a peaceful gathering and it also brought a famous producer into the next level of fame with the line mustaaaaaarrrddd. One song did all this and people still saying that drake isnt worried or effected by Kendrick or what Mr Lamar as drake now calls him. Dude even got Samuel L. Jackson the most famous non alien, not white Jedi. Now drake finally listed to Kendrick when he said he needs to stop trying to act tough and go back to making love songs and songs for the club . Drakes current song is exactly that, clubbing and lovey dovey. Bring cali back into the spotlight in a good way."
I've lost count how many times I've viewed this masterpiece
10:04
Every time I watch this I am amazed with Kendrick's breath control! It isn't talked about enough!
.
Why isn't Jay Z getting any credit..... Remember he blocked Wayne for Kendrick.... Ijs .. Amazing show
Still the coolest thing Ive ever seen

"Kendrick, I love you. Like seriously"
Drake must be crying himself to sleep at night
"Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 KJV Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. [14] For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil."

"stop saying ""who's back here again"" I never leave"
"About That ""simple"" outfit: Those diamond broaches in his hat are priced at over $70k EACH! The leather jacket is custom Made with the emblem of his company ""png"" . The diamond necklace with the ""a"" represents his artistic company valued at over $100k. The jeans are women's flared and fitted & were available for several hundred dollars and sold out everywhere after the halftime performance! His black T-shirt with custom Logo ""keep them away from me"" on the back also saw a rise in sales. The shoes are a retro limited edition Deion Sanders design . Jeans and a T-shirt, a necklace, A base ball Cap and sneakers..... simple!!! And Expensive!"

https://youtu.be/wqpdDeZuYxQ?si=0HUcnTDTu5-PWlX1
Say Drake

The SuperBowl was only three weeks ago yesterday. THREE WEEKS. Longest. 3wks. Ever.
Anyone from Compton ?
Canadian fans here
TURN HIS TV OFF
THAT DEVIOUS SMILE
"Here I am, ready for my daily watch."
"I must have watched this more than 10 times! Brilliant word play, Samuel L. Jackson gave me goose bumps!"
"I watch this at least twice a day, usually five. Also this helps me get at least 15 mins on the stairmaster"
Ac los que nos entendemos absolutamente nada

"Boring Buh they did a great job, not an easy one though"
Thats the pants white girls wore in the early 2000's
"Say ""DRAKE"""
"No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets boring. This is the best half-time show."
7:03 and 10:00
This is LEGENDARY
Becoming a fan of this mans music is easily one of the best decisions Ive ever made.
"Anyone can say whatever they want but his intro rap was fire ,and so we're every other track...he knows his craft to the core ,and the production, Jay -z team incredible.... Kendrick represented us so highly.. meaningful rap is back ..my love for him grew soooo much in just 13mn"
Que presentacin ms infravalorada...
"corrupt a man's heart wit a gif, that's how you find out who you dealin' wit, a small percentage is who I'm buildin' wit....."
20 times and still watching
Guess whose back to watch this masterpiece again
Bro tgat stare was a littile personal and not the smile 10:53
The NFL got nice now ! Thank Kendrick Lamar
Pretty sure kai cenat is wrong about this performance not getting attention from the fans. You can hear alot of reaction from the stands for each song he performed. If its really true then why did he not film his surroundings as proof.
anyone here from march 2025?
The best half time ever.
Play NFl get Kendrick Lamar back to perform and let him perform for 1 hour. Y'all ratings will go through the roof look at the amazing work he did in just 13 minutes it will be a smart move for the NFL to do a huge partnership because if you don't have Kendrick Lamar next year the raiders are going back down. He's the person in the world want to see strike a deal this man creativity is amazing
Ig reels forced me to watch this
When I search up Super Bowl this gives me this before the game
Kendrick Lamar the true professional in great shape you can tell he take his music and art seriously amazing
The amount of times Ive watched this is unhealthy
"Pinky: Gee Brain, what are we gonna do tonight? Brain: The same thing we do every night, try to watch Kendrick Lamar's Halftime Show Pinky: Brilliant plan, Pinky!"
"Best 13 minutes of HipHop Ever. Thank you, Kendrick Lamar, and thank you nfl. Rewatch number 4 and counting.."
nobody cares that its the apple music halftime show. im calling it just the superbowl halftime show no matter how many millions apple paid to have it named after them
Am kenyan but
"it's been 3 weeks, and still get views what a performance"
Im back again watching this!
Man I cant stop watching this
All the people in that stadium.. and on the dance floor.. could all march to the wharves. Open them containers? .. if no ones in there? We pray there is not..?
Inspired.
Kendrick really is the boogeyman to drake
Say Drake....
MUSTAAAAAAARRRD
Say drake
Jayden kion. Wright
Ummmm theres bits missing from the og version???
to be honest im our of breath just watching this
Back here again
10:00
This song has such a catchy beat!
"I'm Scottish so I have never watched the SuperBowl. I just got round to watching this specifically to hear him diss Drake and understand the memes, but the whole performance was so good."
Best halftime in years
Lighting and sound much better on my IPad and iPhone than when I watched it on TV. Great performance. Salute to Kendrick and his team!!
MUSSSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRDDD and Say Drake are definitely my favorites
When humble started playing: Me be like: ni-ki ni-ki ni-ki ni-ki
respect button please
Just gotta say his freestyle about pat mahomes and a rigged superbpwl was funny as hell
NO NO NOO TO RECKSIS TO GETO
Go ahead 100 mil !

"Something just happens to me when Kendrick yells ""MUSTAAAARRDDD!"""

This is fire
Been watching this almost every morning while getting ready for work and while at work
The man walked the whole football field lol breath control at its finest.
1020
He did it again unifying reds and blues and nobody even noticed this mans a genius
"Next time, bring in some pop star artists. I hope next year they bring Dua Lipa or Ariana Grande to the Super Bowl. Not like this one that brings in a great like Drake."
I first hated this but the more I listen to it its so good
What y'all Fav song here?
Kendrick took Drake to hell. Drake is gonna be the only dude in hell with a tombstone.
Mustarddddddddddd
I been here so many times this is gold
Gotta be the biggest diss on the biggest stage
Hearing a TeezoTouchdown reference in a rap-battle track preformed by a Hip-Hop headliner at the SuperBowl is mind-boggling
Back here again!!!
Best halftime show ever!!
10:05
10:00 Drake be crying rn
"Your honor, 93,780,583+ people viewed and screamed a minor"
"I can't stop watching, this is to good. I don't see how anyone could hate this. RIP Drake"
I can't stop watching everything Kendrick Super bowl.... this was brilliant and well executed
I still remember 2pac dissing biggie on his record. And both of them getting murdered. Praising this performance Is ridiculous If u diss someone at this level at school its called bulling A lot of immature people Immature culture
overheating the arena
I am not that being you stay
I was expecting Pin Pan Pum Pum Pum Pam Pyamm
Kendrick Lamar a genius for all time beautiful halftime presentation and if you didn't understand it watch it again because he did a fabulous job the best hair full super bowl halftime I've seen!!!! 13:21 13:21 13:21

What drug did he put into this performance? I'm on my 2648349317041382nd watch
"For ppl saying its been a boring performance, Im seeing a lot of YALL imitating him! Lets go Kendrick!"
I wish kdot had the red van from good kid Madd City cover and all them people coming out of the van as an extra middle finger to drakela
I've been here everyday since the Super Bowl.
11:08 11:08 all the dancer are black wtf he is racist? 11:33 no white 11:45
just realized when you only look at his legs. bc of the jeans he looks like a woman
the fact that the official Sonic channel referenced this a while back is insane work 0_0
Somebody check Drakes pulse
Just watching this for the first time
this will never NOT be hard. love kendrick so much!!
A minor necklace bro das crazy
"A college professor showed us this video because she wanted us to find the dual meanings in the lyrics the shape they created when performing and the overall performance and the meanings should be related to African American history but englisj not my first language so i didnt understand anything he was singing and the whole time i was like What could be the hidden meaning for that par- wooo he got a stable voice , ohhh he is a good performer, so talented , yaa i should listen to his songs they sound good, he was been singing for soo long and is still going smoothh wowowow. So yaa when the discussion time came i just pretended I didn't exist there. And I came back to watch this performance . Nicely performed"
Who's the girl in the background... She has a beautiful voice... What's her name? Love her voice
Why do his back up dancers remind me of red and white blood cells
well. . . .
Salutation

my bad kendrickdid ma research
Blood n crips haha 2025
American football the sport where a performance by an artist at the halftime is better or more interesting than the actual sport
"Kendrick Lamar is the only artist who would write your obituary and deliver it televised, whilst also sending his condolences for the sudden loss of your career. Kdot is the John Wick of hip-hop."
"The NFL allowing Kendrick to pop off the way he did has given me an odd kind of respect for them, and I don't even watch football!"
10:19
10:52 Say Drake
"Masterfully choreographed .... Great halftime show, it was created for TV feed but it always freakin cool"
Watching this from Ghana
@nfl enough with the commercials.
"Happy new month MARCH, here again"

Mustard

"En mi opinion, la piernuda con faldita de colegiala fue lo mejor de Este SHOW, aparte de l@s bailarines. LA A-ROBA la USO para describir ambos sexos. No para majistrades... Con todo respeto para el MAJISTRADE, EPD."
This is probably the worst halftime show ever
Do it
Still listening Feb 2025
"3 weeks later, still here!"
9:59 Kendrick is a troll
"People have watched this for 854,627 days so far."
"that smile after he says ""hey drake"" OH. MY. GOD."
"The fact that I'm South African, but I understood every message in the whole show shows that this man knows how to send a message through and through"
5:47 why does the guy behind Kendrick look like @ibekeigh
This so smart
Poor drake was humiliated
Say Drake
Cant describe how amazing this was!!! What a talent !!!!

Greatest Super Bowl performance of all time. My toddler asks to listen to Endrick Lamar morning noon and night. He has memorized the dance moves and lyrics. Hes been his number 1 fan since before Not Like Us came out

"Only 3 million upvotes on this masterpiece. So, what - it's just us 3 mill watching it again and again because we cannot get it out of our heads? I'm strangely okay with that. It makes me feel less weird for coming back to this every few days just to revel in this man's artistry."
Nice
The cheography was on point man Everything
A Dot can I get a drop? ............ naw.
"The best besides Micheal Jackson. I would say Micheal, Kendrick, Red Hot Chili Peppers best half time shows ever."

Thank you so much for this video. It was very instructive.
"Interesting perspective, listen to how wild the crowd goes during the drake diss compared to how quiet they are during his other performances, some of which is literal art. You all talk about peace and humanity but when it comes to it underneath we are all animals."
the best halftime show of all time

Gold 10:53
Who deleted my comment

Im Trippin Im sledding. Im riding through the back like its up. That part is gold.
This isn't music.
After watching Lil Lean Wayne performing at SNL and again with Birdman and BG leaned out on stage. NFL made a smart choice.
Pac is so proud!
STUPID MUSIC ONLY POPULAR IN MOST TOXIC COUNTRY?
Nobody cool is watching this.
"COMPTON, STAND TF UP!!!!!"
Drake go sit down Kendrick had the stadium and millions at home singing along Kendrick has won
Kendrick is trending in multiple countries and haters still got the nerve to say nobody is listening to Kdot.
Kendrick
It's March and I'm still watching this show.
Song for xxxtentacion death
"I would say, crowd hyped by kendrick leaved me in awe, especially when they diabolically give me diarrhea while screaming ""A Minooor"""
11:20
This could easily be a musical play about 90 minutes long on broadway.

Now why is there commercials?? greedy af
Turns is TV of =( like) PALestina

"I don't understand what the fuss is about. Naturally, coffee w/o cream is an acquired taste. It's not for everyone but I'm here for it"
You have to be an absolute NPC to think this was good
BIG as the what?..Famous last words
Lip syncing is so What a Boring Halftime Show!
There are some girls that are straight crumping in there LOVE IT !
"Literally nothing for stadium audience, all for television and internet hype."

"Icl ts pmo sm, pls sybau Kendrick"
This was just Kendricks televised victory lap
Good music

Just been ending my evenings with this. Didnt even watch the Super Bowl.
9:58
"As a white middle aged man.. grew up in the early 80's as ""rap"" started to emerge and gain a foothold .. its been great to see it progress and gain well deserved respect. KM put on fantastic show and I loved to see SW crip walk.."
Peekaboo performance was very great.

"As a mayo shaded, ketchup is spicy Caucasian, I didn't understand a quarter of what he said... and it was definitely one of my favorite Super Bowl Halftime Shows."
"Serena from Compton, yall forget"
Love it
"If Im being honest, this was a mid halftime show. They couldve definitely done better."
I feel like yall should put this out as a live album

Good music one for all I thought this was a bad music now I think its the best music I ever think by Kendrick

The only way you could make me a happy man and you know I would never ever want that for myself I dont even care what anyone thinks of it but Im going for a ride to get it for me because you have no choice and Im going with my best friends house so you know
"Round 550. I need my fix. Hater mode uploading.......""Say Drake's"" the refill......."
No wonder Drake is suing!!!

"Now this is becoming a problem, I shouldn't be watching this video every day but I can't help myself."
My sisters just came back from that I think they went to one that is Suzanne and Kendrick Lamar concert

"I'm a portuguese woman, and until a few weeks ago didn't know any of Kendrick Lamar's music, athough i love black culture and knew he was one of the biggest rappers. Now I'm obsessed and can't stop watching this performance, reading about the meaning of his lyrics and watching clips of his interviews. What a mind....such talent and intelligence ! And absolutely adorable with one of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen. Artists like this restore my faith in humanity"
I cried when Mustard came out. The way he looked at Kendrick was beautiful
"Can anyone spot Biniyam from 90DF anywhere?? lol hes in there, congrats to him! Edit: I believe he was one of the dancers in white."
11:48 Bru turned in to Eminem
Okay he got his 15 minutes of glory. Drake just took over his number one album spot even after all this y'all. LET THAT SINK IN
10:54 that grin is pure evil
92 mil in 2 weeks?! This has to make over 100 million views in a month. This will be the biggest ever!
Playing on th3 TV and my phon3. Calling it Doubl3 thym3. No bots on this on3. Run it up
"Sure, when he only hires non-whites its not a problem, but when i hire only white people suddenly im a racist."
"When someone asks you to define Perfection, simply show them this performance."
11:54

luther was so good
Best halftime show in history
Biggest show ever
3:08 babies at 3 am
"Oh and also I dont think rap artist in general get enough credit for censoring their songs when doing them live and or in a place with stricked language requirements. Its actually insane....put on a song you like with a ton of swear words, and try and censore it while you're singing. I promise its harder than they ever make it look!!!"
When are we going to get the 1st song (Bodies/Tiramisu)???
"A parte que voc quer ver t nos 10 minutos, espero te ajudado"
Well I'm here again
"Oh, so that's where my jeans from middle/high school went to!"
Here for my daily dose
The whole stadium with A minor took Drake out!
Why skip words man
"We know those who are complaining, are complicit! P E R I O D"
I'm here for the 100th time and I'll never get tired of this. Thx my
"Oh my God, back at it again"
Daily reminder that being a hater pays hard
And people say this was the worst halftime show.
"They have added more to this, idc what anyone says! This video is different"
Sza is Kendrick Lamars Work Wife I love it when they collaborate
Still bumpin it daily.

"i can't stop watching this, it's just so amazing"
Absolute ridiculous breath control
I hate those who feel entitled
Respect for the hard work and talent. Frustrating not being able to understand the message.
I think mustard was scared when the dancers ran closer
I cant believe how exhausted he must have been after this.

"When Kendricks Said Be Humble he mean that We Should STOP Be Humble Under White People, and Take back our POWER. KENDRICKS Performance is NOT for Entertainment, Only, its For us Black People to WAKE UP UNITE And Take Back Our POWER BACK. UNITE UNITE UNITE, And Get Rid of the Generational Curse, SLAVERY. IMANICIPATE YOURSELF FROM MENTAL SLAVERY, NONE BUT YOURSELF CAN FREE YOUR MINDS."

"West coast always have the venom , just natural talent."

Yup. Back again. No regrets
"Say Drake, I hit you like Im Young"
I loved it a Playstation stage
One of the best performances ever! The subtle political undertones didn't go unnoticed
This is a masterpiece. I notice something different each time I watch this.
He really knows his lyrics at best.
Drake is so Finished.
Interesting.

"how tf do people actually think this was horrible? this is my fav halftime show in the 14 years ive been alive; the message it was sending, the performance, everything. smh"
Drake fans have to cope hard to not admit that this was the most one sided rap beef in history
Bets on when this video will pass 100M?
Someone tell me the drake and Kendrick beef.....
Kai said it was n0 sound
Minus the anti-white stuff it was good.
Very nice moves

"The fact that they could go down the stairs stomping and dont fall is impressive, I would have caused a domino effect."
Greatest Super Bowl yet
How many times have you watched this? Answer: yep
Best low end trick ever. The bass is crazy https://youtu.be/oeu3h6OwXMU?si=8injfI7nMmKiQ_cC
"As a white male from the country Best halftime show ever hands down, i need this mans cardio i dont know how he can do all that keep a steady breath and everything."
"0:53 Are we gonna ignore how many people were in that car? I mean, Im sure there was an opening beneath the stage, but it looked like a clown car"
Not 1 white dancer wat happened to diversity I enjoyed it but would of been up roar if there was no black dancers the usual cry why they all white would have been yelled
I wish they said R.I.P Chadwick Boseman when the all the stars song started playing
Crazy when they start peekaboo Sam Jackson said deduct one life read between the lines
Man this has 91+ mil views!
Let's get this to 2 billion views
Yeah that song
"Im not a Kendrick fan but that luther song is just so good, and they got great chemistry"
"when he says game over, its a cultural representation that the culture is no more white, and now america will have to face black culture, because kendrick ""rig the game"", thats so epic, im sure this will become a historical moviment against racism"
Why do I keep coming back to this performance. Absolutely bonkers!
I love this so much. They invited Kendrick and he invited the whole culture
Bro did not care to say hey drake I hate you like Im young
Nah why did the cuss words get censored
the beef is litterly roasted
If they let him really sing the songs then it would be number 1
love you bro
"I've been back daily, mutiple times a day. I can't get enough."

Fgp
12:34 he said diddy
Yeah man I think he's had enough. You people obey the 48 laws of power to a T. But it conflicts with the art of war in many areas. You don't have to destroy him entirely. If Drake is rivaling me I must be doing alright in life. He's suffered enough from this.

Hi NFL

Sza's entry
Over 90 million views and the NFL apologized for this?
"Did he actually think that, that crowd was going to repeat,"" a minor?"" you can barely hear the 10 people in the crowd that said that phrase. These people were not into it and there was a reason for that. Most of the cheering Came from the dancers which took up the whole field."

Being the black population is always mad because there isnt enough black people in the various award shows held every year do you think they will stand up and say how come there wasnt white people in this show?
"*Fun fact...* If you squint, you might notice that this performance was in the middle of a sports game. If I'm not mistakes, american rugby. No idea who was playing, who won, what the score was or why I should care. I don't care about normal Rugby."
Hey drake
Yea
Worst halftime show I've ever seen. tbh NF would be better
What a run. Id hate to be on the other side of this onslaught
He literally embarrassed drake in one week he won didn't just one not two not even three he won five Grammys and when he one of the grammys everyone sung along to the minor and they did at the super Bowl This guy is embarrassing so much

Baaaaack
"The story behind this performance: Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX halftime show was a dynamic and layered spectacle, intertwining themes of personal evolution, societal critique, and artistic rivalry. The performance opened with Lamar and his dancers stepping out of a 1980s Buick GNX onto a stage designed to resemble a massive PlayStation controller, symbolizing the intersection of his personal journey with broader cultural narratives. Throughout the show, Samuel L. Jackson appeared as ""Uncle Sam,"" delivering satirical commentary that underscored America's cultural divisions. This character acted as a narrative guide, leading the audience through themes of unity, discord, and reflection. A standout moment came during Lamar's performance of ""Not Like Us,"" a track known for its sharp critique of fellow artist Drake. Despite previous legal disputes, Lamar boldly included the song, prefacing it with a wry remark about potential lawsuits: ""I wanna play their favorite song, but you know they love to sue."" This moment highlighted themes of authenticity and competition within the music industry. Adding another layer of depth, Serena Williams joined the performance with a striking dance during ""Not Like Us."" Her presence alluded to her own experiences with public scrutiny and criticism, amplifying the show's exploration of resilience and societal challenges. The performance concluded with the words ""GAME OVER"" illuminated through synchronized crowd wristband lights, signaling the close of one chapter and perhaps the beginning of a new phase in Lamar's artistic journey. In sum, Lamars halftime show was a masterful narrative, weaving together elements of personal growth, cultural reflection, and industry dynamics, and inviting the audience to engage with its intricate storytelling."

"Cant stop, wont stop watching this! Tomorrow is March 1st and this performance still has me in a chokehold"

The last shovel of dirt has just been thrown on top of Drake's coffin.
Jay Z is a genius

"Well, its the best halftime performance I can remember. I dont remember MJ or Whitney Houston or Prince or whoever. Im super biased though, I havent ever liked Drake and Ive always loved Kendrick. I really appreciate the winning Kendrick is getting for standing up for good things instead of drakes steady stream of debauchery."

Kendrick Lamar is a lyrical genius.Fire performance.5 grammys.They not like us.
"""K-DOT. Kendrick Lamar Ok Llama Mr. Morale"" is something i never thought i would ever hear"
WoW
Mustard is living his best life i swear
This is my alarm fr 2:56
yoooooooooooooooooooo boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy drakeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Drake ? where are you
This not a funeral it's a ritual!! The sacrifice of drake to uplift the culture!! Kendrick dug up body and put it in acid!! Kendrick the stu-maker!!! Kendrick on cartel time!!
I couldn't care less if only black people perform there. The performance is terrific. I love it. Greetings from Germany.
"I always thought it was ""Buzzer on the beat"", Kendrick bringing Mustard all the credit he deserves through out all these years!"
bro added too much mustard on the beat
"2pac is starring down, saying ""Kendrick you got the juice now!!! Tupac Shakur that aligns with ""spark the world,"" is: ""I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world."" Kendrick is the brain he sparked!!!!!!"
Anyone who has to ask just confirms how rubbish this is. To must people this sounds like mmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm mmmmm non mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmm the non would be the highlight
https://youtu.be/j3gQE989PeM?si=JYhhmmU7glyFUbly
eu fico toda me tremendo
Hey Drake
I watch this video at least twice a day- making my personal contribution to get this to 100 million views. Best halftime show ever!!!
using a real band woulda made this performance so much better
I watch this everyday
Kendrick just is one of the greatest in this century. No contest.
10:53 THAT GRIN THAT IS HATE TO ANOTHER LEVEL MAN
Im back
Come here daily!
Average show when compared to MJ's performance in 1993
Man
10:19
Why so many ads
Omg
"11:09 ""Certified lover boy, certified RAAAAAAAAAAAH-"""
Lamal
100 million views soon
Literally cannot stop watching this
I hope America knows what they have in this man
10:00 You were waiting for for this one!
Plot twist: K Dot had Samuel L Jackson IN his performance because years ago a reporter mistakenly thought Samuel L Jackson had a super bowl commercial...Dot is a genius
Whats the first song?? I need that!
Back for 80 th time
Whitout cussing
DAYUM this is the best song i've ever heard in months
I couldn't care less about this dude or Drake. As someone who doesn't know what they're beefing about I couldn't care less.
Listening it on rewind
We all. Know. Kendrick is going to win this battle yall
fire
Guy lets appreciate sza to i know it was. Mostly Kendrick
Here again
DRAKE
"if theres anything this performance should teach everyone its that.. you can always hate more, hate bigger, hate bolder"
man everyone in my school fr be hitting that step
Who saw at the very end of the halftime show it said game over
i really don't see a single white guy... like seriously
"""like a good neighbor stay over there"""
90 million views so far!!!!! Economic Blackout today for bad companies so watching this again while relaxing
Revolutionary!!!!
SZA )))
Enjoying a smoke and the sunshine listening to Kendrick such a good day Happy Friday!
NGL on the intro I thought he was going to say Tom not Sam.
This is racist there is no White dancer
"Guys, support lamar, share this video with friends and family members to help King reach 100m hard digit..."
90 mill views crazy work.
BEST HALFTIME SHOW EVERRRRRRR! BEST SUPERBOWL EVERRRRRRR!
Germany is ready
#KendrickLamar
Was a t 70 million views a week or two after the superbowl. Now it's at 90 million at the end of February. I hope I'm not the only one who likes putting it on to jam for 12 minutes every once in a while
Tryna strike a chord and its prolly A MINORRR!!
"Hey Fox news casters and boomers who thought this sucked, guess 90MM disagree. You all had your run, time to just chill and get your SS checks."
Halftime show more popular than the game this year
G
sza is so bad ngl anyone wit me??
"5:18 What did kendrick say here? Im not native so i have trouble trying to understand while the song is playing, if he was saying it without music i might be able to understand but idk I only understand the""man i know yall can't sleep, ever since ______ its kdot bum"""
Who here disappointed he didnt perform m.A.A.d City?
I don't know why nobody is talking about the Intro and Outro Song. The name is 'The Old is Guard is dead' by Ghais Guevara and you don't even know how hard the full song goes
I had to rewatch this because my Junior High School prom sang Not Like Us and literally dissed drake that hard
The fact that he kept it clean is actually clean
I don't know why nobody is talking about the Intro and Outro Song. The name is 'The Old is Guard is dead' by Ghais Guevara and you don't even know how hard the full song goes
The chain stands for a minor hes a genius
The second most-watched funeral after Queen Elizabeth II's
why isnt anyone talking abt the way Kendrick smiled when he sang the AzChike verse?
10:52-10:53 diabolical
Sit Down Be Humble!
Lil Suzy!!
I dont understand single lyric. Love the beats tho
"Unbelievably amazing. The sheer amount of allusions, story, and choreography is so so so cool. Kendrick is the best!"
I KEEP ON COMING BACK TO THIS
10:20 = AURA
Here again!
"*I get this crazy feeling:* l like a coldsweat ""AHHH"" fatigue type feeling as the performance is being announced. I havent felt this ""its about to happen"" over excitement feeling since i used to perform as a cheerleader: WHY DO I FEEL THIS MOMENT? its a black out thang"
EPIC!!
Yes Im back
Was show back again.kendrick
El mejor
Yea had to comeback can't get bored of this
Am to the pm to the pm to the am funk ..that part
"his smile at the end is so perfect, he looks like he had a great time. soo happy to see this man get his flowers"
I like to performance and I like whoever directed it but we definitely know their lip singing
Only 172k comments. That speaks volumes Not to sure the crowd noise is really coming from the crowd it may be the sound guy adding cheers from the audience
Again
If you cannot sing all the words to the song then what us it worth ?
I'm back here for the 100th time now.
Stupid
WTF is this $&@
I hear there was a football game in the background at the Kendrick concert...can someone confirm or deny this for me?
X X X T E N T A C I O N would be proud of him....
"serena williams is stupid, i cant stand her. what is she doing there? want to be the star when no one cares or remembers you"
"Am I reading too deep if I say this performance is only 10% lamar and 90% what was being said and shown by the whole field, and is absolutely epic, not just for ken, not just for the audience, but for the absolute deepest trees rooted in our nation. Just me?"
I must watched it 20 times by now
Drake is dead
her voice is so GORGEOUS
This has to get to 1 billion views
Was that Bum at 5:23 a callback to his Like That verse? He also ended that with Bum
I Play this on my drive to class everyday like the mix of songs are perfect not to mention uncle sam and the kdot angels fantastic performance all around 4:36 is satisfying too
Bro got real hatred in his body
How you gonna give me 3 commercials for one video come on wtf
telat nyimak spiral
"This man was smiling while saying ""say Drake"""
Road to 100 million
The people also screamed a minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Drake needs to retire after this
Not as good as Kendrick Miguel Tanfelix performance go look it up
I'm here.....again!
say Drake
"3:03 serial grifter Matt Walsh said these were songs that no football fans have ever heard of, Be Humble has 2 billion views on YouTube lmao."
i thought they ended this beef a while ago
Back again
8:32 mingle game
Eazy-e vibes outfit
Love it
Mustarddddddddddddddddddddd
"""Remember the food stamp colors was tan and brown? But now the hunnid is blue!"""

This halftime show is for those who understand how tariffs work.
"People sleeping on Man in the Garden (""I see you brought your homeboys. . ."")"
"This whole Kendrick performance, Uncle Sam comments and the DANCING(!) is just SO darn good. I just find myself watching it over and over again"
And i am here again Just can't get enough
"Imagine being white, having a camouflage baseball cap, sunglasses and hating EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF THIS."
I always feel pumped watching this specific half time show for 2025.
OMG two ex drake
I wish I was here live.
"so many people in the car, how'd they fit."
To bad I can only thumbs up this thing once!!!
I have never watched the super bowl or half time but I cant stop coming back this is amazing
And doechii is the godess
Kendrick Lamar is a rap god
90k w3 on our way
Performing an unreleased track/teaser as the intro is just insane!!! Tell em Kendrick did it
If you don't have Kendrick Lamar next year your viewer ratings we'll go back down tremendously give Kendrick Lamar a 1-hour show and let him do his creative thing
Y'all need to put Kendrick Lamar in your NFL Hall of Fame
10th time watching this
Kendrick Lamar football game NFL y'all need to give him an hour performance it will be a great move for y'all
NFL y'all better make Kendrick Lamar Big partner and pay him to come do a 1-hour show y'all see the amazing work he did ninja 13 minutes imagine if this man had a 1-hour show it will be the first time in NFL history yeah I will probably get a billion views
E ele entregou tudo
"Bro was like ""say drake"""
how come I keep watching this?
The more I watch the more I appreciate this
11:28 the crip walk
I'm here agaaaaaain How many times? I have no idea
11:33 my fav part and its not cuz of Serina .
The big RED button in the beginning is a slick call back to the battle. What a show. I keep catching subtle crumps everytime I watch this.
The way he said drakes name got me coughing
10:00 youre welcome
ight im back for some replay again
I havent watched a half time show in over 10 years! This was epic! I absolutely love this whole performance. Everything about this show was amazing. Great job
"Fwd: 24 hour Economic Blackout 24 hour Economic Blackout The 24 hour Economic Blackout As our first initial act, we turn it off. For one day we show them who really holds the power.

90m
HONESTLY I WILL BE TAKING THE TIME TO READ THE COMMENTS FROM THOSE WHO ARE NOW GOING DOWN THE KDOT HOLE !!! THIS IS WHAT MUSIC SHOULD BE DOING AND THATS CREATING A BRIDGE FOR CONSUMERS TO CROSS AND ALLOW THEM TO LEARN ABOUT A WORLD THEY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT!!!! ITS SO IMPORTANT AND KENDRICK HAS DONE WHAT NO OTHER ARTIST HAS DONE BEFORE HIM
1
8:29 The best part of the show !!!
"everytime I watch this I find a new detail, This is such a masterpiece"
9:57
Name if first song/part?
sza is definitely lip syncing
Since when is hip-hop not cool?
Why is the volume lowered?? @NFL? It was not like this.When you all first posted this video.
This performance made me freaking love peakaboo.
"February 28, 2025.... Yes, I'm a part of the bot community running up these numbers cause this is a performance"
10:03 drake is just gonna be flaubergausted
I still come back here. Powerful stuff!
Best halftime show ever! I like Serena Williams doing a c walk.
Imagine dissing somebody and they come back dissingtrack and it wins 5 Grammy's by itself then they play it at the super bowl
I love the fact he censors himself
"Kendrick Lamar rwanda w, love you"

90M in 2 weeks! Might do 100 M before it hits a month. Crazyyy
Drake aint come outside that day or turn the tv on
Lets just cancel next year's Superbowl halftime show and replay this.
...
I dont know if ive ever been prouder to be an American
This was such a good show on all accounts. Props to Kendric Props to the dancers Props to the choreographers Everyone involved understood the assignment
11:29 who is that women?
The dancers and Kendrick Lamar work so perfectly and Uncle Sam is just accurate to the chef's kiss
"16th time viewing, inspires me every time"
"samuel l jackson as uncle sam to represent what america would think of what kendrick meant here is insane. also the ""say drake"" while smiling into the camera-"
What song is the opening called?
Best one ever way too fire
The best half time show ever. Hands down!
All these boomers getting their diapers in a bunch because everything isn't curated for their enjoyment anymore
Do y'all remember when people used to try to put toenail trimmings on people's sammiches...
"10:23 you can hear someone say ""NO!"""
Im back here for like a 100th time
"People are describing this as ""came and went"" 90M views in 2 weeks... sure"

My favorite song performed man at the garden acappella with the harmony bomb
omg look at the viewssss
The all male all female dancers is genius
So that chain is a minor
"Honestly, I thought it would have a lot of views. considering the beef and the only person to give a drake a run for his buck. Mmm I dont think this beef is over. Personally I was hyped when J Cole dropped his own 7 min diss. Wished hed never apologized. I would love to see how Kendrick and Cole wouldve had been"
Yo it's good I'm from 2050
90 Million soon
Mustard!
They're not like us.
Cant stop watching ts
I watch this daily and I don't even watch sports.
Im not much for football but greatest half time show ever that was historic
Someone breakdown the playlist please?
i think i have watched this to much i almost remember everything
Light is back!
Back erday!!!
The only funeral i will keep watching over and over
Its so good
Brilliant
history...
ultimate flex: be pinned by afl
"Waiting for the ""Kiki, they not like us"" remix"
here back to back again and again
Lame music
Absolutely terrible halftime show
9:49
Seems lik Blackbowl to me. Where are white guys on it
"Well, well,, here I am again, for the 10,000th time? Not sure coz Ive lost count at this point"
I'm not really a Kendrick fan but I keep coming back to watch because this was really .
the grande performance
Watch the views
Honestly this keeps me going for real
10:16
7:58 goosebumpssssss
Imagine singing so good live they think your mic is off
What song is at 8:32?
Really cooked
What. It sucked
Still watching
Again n again............I can't leave
Purely sucked. The worst ever Superbowl performance
Why ain't anyone talking bout SZA???? She added so much to the performance it was heavenly
7:9 was wildest
"89 million views, go off KDot"
"Serena is still the baby girl,love her appearance here."
Welp.. here I am again
I watch this everyday
I watch this every week
8:29
Next Super Bowl we want to see CHRIS BROWN
When the halftime show is better the the game
This is legendary
im still here
11:54 best shot of the performance
Whos here at least once a day since SuperBowl?? >>>>>>>>>>>>
'SAY DRAKE' and the SMILE is cold
The camera man is the real MvP
Did Y'all clock Kida the Great 6:26
"So much depth and meaning. First Super Bowl halftime show Ive watched in full, multiple times. DONT GIVE THE SYSTEM THE SATISFACTION"
I'm 60. Rap started after I did. This is likely to go down as one of the greatest Rap performances of all time.
Like for cameraman
"2 and half weeks later, im back here watching it again...AGAIN"
Can we take time to appreciate SZA her voice is beautiful
Great video and just goes to show that The Super Bowl attendees are there for the GAME! Supporting their Team! Just like all the other Super Bowls where sometimes the Fanbase Knows the Artist Music and sometimes they Dont! With that being Said they Still were locked in Standing Up and Recording the Moment even if they didn't understand the Lyrics or Know the Artist. People like Kai trying to compare the Crowd's participation in a Sports Halftime Show to a Kendrick Concert is the Problem! Two Very Different Things! If you filled the Arena with Kendrick Fans instead of Chiefs and Eagles Fans then you would know the Difference. #JustSaying K Dot put on for the Culture and this Performance was AMAZING!!
Say Drake
"Yep, I'm back again"
Greatest of all time
Corporate media is in charge of everything you watch. You are being brainwashed. Turn the TV off. Think for yourself. #MESSAGE
Its almost March 2025 and we are all here...
"really good! wish he played money trees, collard greens, swimming pools, count me out, maad city etc tho"
The longest Half Time Show ever. Can't stop watching it. Send help.
"I love black folks man. I think they are here to teach us to never loose our inner childhood curiosity and integrity. They are just cool. All these other groups that try to box them - I now understand why - in fact they should just take notes. The non-believers cannot be contained, will not be contained and can never be contained. The stereotypes just exacerbate their originality. Ya'll must have more babies, the world needs more people like you. The 13 minutes flew by - this show was too short.its time to catch up - lets go! Mhhhmmm which album do I start with? ya'll just epitomize love. Can I be your friend? excluding Obama - Obama is just another Drake, his not contributing to the revolution."
Genuine chills
11:21

7:25 .
MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD
I cant stop watching
SZA Represents the black singer. That's always putting out inspirational music to uplift us doing times of hardships.
How many times have you watched this?
What's the name of the songs?
8:33 basdiessss
"""Big as the what??????????????"""
10:10 !!!
https://youtu.be/kW2mpI9xE_c?si=3ps2Dl8i7QQ31sjb
10:53 when drake watched smile 2 i'm convinced this is what he saw for over two hours straight on loop
This reviving me after ig reels
You know how crazy it is to debut a song on the day of the superbowl
Bruh when first time in the x when make it fast forward it soo funny
And who said this performance was terrible? Crazy. This is phenomenal.
"Are you my friend, Are we Locked in, then step this way. Calling out everybody to step up for black people.The way we step up for you."
Love that everyone who talks about this being the worst halftime really didn't pay attention to Uncle Sam.
"They try to rig the game, but you can't fake influence. Talking about black people's impact on american culture"
Croissant
Great performance from Lamar
I dont like when people get too famous and their motivations change and the magic is lost. Not Kendrick tho. Stay humble
Ok Im back
It was very instructive
Notice how the lights are only flashing on the rich people in the box suites when he says sit down be humble.
thanks for the joy i loved this is the best
I love that he chose to close with TV Off because thats what I was planning to do after the halftime show anyway
"This was the most beautiful vibe, and if you didn't get it or feel offended, you need to examine yourself."

As always a lot of political messages
Thank you kdot saving this granny hips
"Such an iconic performance! Thank you to Kendrick, SZA, Samuel Jackson, Sarina Williams, TDE, PGLang, Apple Music, and the NFL for putting this entertaining show together! Shout out to all the dancers and crew that put in work so that we could enjoy this at home on the tv!"
Well this was uneventful and quite boring tbh.
"Back again everything about this is amazing. Like every single detail. Im half deaf so for me, the best part is i can literally hear every word clear as day while he is moving all around."

Wow that was amazing.
We back after Drake has now added this performance to the lawsuit.
Drake put this in the lawsuit and now im back here just because ...
I get that you need ad revenue NFL. Running ads before the video is fine. Running ads after the video is fine. But breaking into this piece of art at the middle with ads is criminal. Turn those off!

Your Hip-hop https://youtu.be/KekUF5G5mBk?si=e1PHvmOiSrtA0Qa_
Fine shyt what's her insta???
1:30 someone let her squabble up
"Not even from the US, this is magic"
who also here for not like us
Drake is going to have to think of a big come back
gross how far the USA has fallen. United States of Africa.
Best Drake troll!
PLEASE HAVE TYLER THE CREATOR
In rich spirit Kendrick said stop playing with me before I turn you to a song.
10:01 he really bout to do it?
"He makes it look so easy because he's a master at his craft, but the stamina and discipline and breath control it took to do what he did is CRAZY. Respect."
I done watched this joint bout Fifty-Leven times
He really said this Talking to my future kids
1:30 someone let her squabble up
The following people have performed at the Super Bowl before Drake: *-His exs (3 of them to be exact)* *-His op* *-The Weeknd* *-Uncle Sam*
7:45
My 4th time.
man this is sooooooooooooooo fKNG FIREEEEEEEEEEE
"Also if any of you havent listened to his newest album gnx, please do. Its a no skips project, I listen to it everyday. I was very grateful and surprised he did most of his set from that album!"
TV OFF was perfect for the Superbowl. Pure victory music!!!!!
10:28 not like us
11:18
10:00
I Watch This Everyday. Im In Love Yall.
Drake he sad
"Why do, and why does Drake make fun of Kendrick's ""Height"" when he's literally the same Height as Lil'Wayne, a couple inches shorter than Eminem, and a few (3"") shorter than Tupac Shakur... It just hit me. Maybe they get into Poetry, Music, and Rap bcuz they're not involved with most sports. I love that quote, though. ""Almost All Athletes wanna make music, and Most Rappers wanted to play Pro Sports growing up."""
I cant stop
This has insane replay value
Back for the last time. (for this week)
As soon as Kendrick said Hey Drake bro was looking into his soul
"Every time I watch it, I see something else. He starts out kinda kneeling with a cadence in the microphone that reminds me of XXXTentacion. At first I thought it was a coincidence, then I noticed the females hair is one side red/one side black. X wore one side black the other blonde. For those who arent familiar with X, its rumored that Drake had him sent to the upper room."
Thank you very much.
"""Finesse a no-no"""
CAN ANYONE GUESS WHO THEY GONNA NEXT YEAR AFTER THIS EPIC PERFORMANCE?
I'm back here Edit: +5

https://youtu.be/H-iaS6iVR4k?si=f7BTafby-BM5AoN0
im just thinking about how much he had to have practiced not singing the swear words lmao
ESTE TIPO ROMPIOOOOOOO
Everybody wanna tell Kendrick how to perform but they never did it
"This shi just makes me happy, following knot from day dot from and seeing him staying in his own lane and still getting the exposure in mainstream media he deserves. Possibly the greatest to ever do it."
10:52
A Master piece type performance
4:55 is my fav part. That walk down is crazy.... BOMB
"Drake has an estimated net worth of $250 million, while Kendrick Lamar's net worth is estimated at $140 million.....Really no need for Drake to respond. Get your money up Kendrick"
I feel bad for whoever is next yrs performer lol
i can`t stop rewatching this...
I cant believe ppl still saying this was boring .
FAAAAAACE 1:18

I can tell that Drake is not happy with the Grammy's at all I can tell Drake will be going back too or performing at the Grammy's anytime soon in the near future.
89M views after only two weeks is insanity
I know yall probably not gonna see this NFL because this was like a couple weeks ago or maybe just a week ago but can you please remove Kendricks background vocals whilst is a singing Luther because it was I like the isolation of her voice it sounded beautiful and it doesnt sound the same with the backing vocals. Could you please take them away please if you see this.
Ouvindo essa todo dia
Everything I come here I notice more Easter eggs Kendrick and Team are 21st century geniuses! HiiPower
Le show est lgendaire
Im listening to this 5x a day ATLEAST + everyday.

Thank you for bringing this performance to the field! Most performances are higher up on a stage. But this time is was 'on the floor
Great preformance ngl but he was messing up some of his own lyrics but at least he wasnt lip sinking
"A genius artist at work, the simbolisms are crazy! Game over, hip hop is back"
"Gurl, the world is healing."
"I havent seen any other halftime show in my life, yet I can say, this is the best one EVER"
Meanwhile drake singing in Australia concert ignoring kendrick halftime show
History

That was a brilliant musical with a message
Meant Sza
Saw was beautiful.
Top 3 SuperBowl performance!
cringe
"I've been watching this at least once a day, I can't get enough of it! Kendrick Lamar is a GENIUS"
Here I almost 3 weeks later
4 unskippable ads in the middle of this is absolutely crazy
"KENDRICK COOKED, the back up dancers ATE....Been here since Feb 9"
Can't get enough of this performance. Kendrick is the GOAT
I've been watching this at least twice a day since it was uploaded and every time I notice something I hadn't seen before.
Yooooooo Kendrick & Philly Eagles dopest SB EVER REALRAP
It is unhealthy the amount of times i have watched this
Watched this video an unhealthy amount of times
goooo sizaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I bet Drake will NEVER tell Kenny come out side again
Kendrick deserves an Emmy for this.
Some people pray when they get up in the morning. I Kendrick Lamar when I get up in the morning. Pretty much the same thing.
Watch it everyday
I watch this 3 times a day. Sometimes more . Incredible performance
13th time back
Revolution is about to be telivised...
7:44 is my favorite
Wowww that was amazing great job Kendrick great job And also thank you Super Bowl for letting him perform there
Kendrick Lamar redefined rap music. I keep coming back to watch this awesome halftime. God bless Kendrick!!
He actually brought back dancing in hip hop. He had a few moves.
This song is not only a diss to aubrey. It represents a stance and resistance against all PDFs and the rampant normalization of sexualizing children
"I will always come back to this. This is single-handedly the best Super Bowl halftime performance ever: the messages, the people, the center of it all and the audience being so in sync throughout the entire performance. Kendrick also single-handedly fought for all little girls that night, performing Not Like Us. I always knew of Kendrick and heard a song or two, but now he has risen as one of my favourite artists. Best of all time."
Sza looks good and she sounds good
im back
13:10
"From the Jordan river , to the Mediterranean Sea."

"Kendrick, we are waiting for you to reach 100M on this"
I knew Kendrick from this he broke the internet he's all over the net R.I.P Drake's career
Why did he leave out all the cuss words
Been coming back here daily
"Mr Lamar didnt do the show for those people in the arena, its for the culture"
10:15
"Drake once said ""I'll go make some M's and give some millions to my people"" the superbowl doesn't pay performers, but gives them a $15 million dollar budget... Kendrick owns the production company that did his whole superbowl setup...Dot doesn't have to brag, but we just watched him split $15 million with his people..."
One of the best halftimes in a very long time.
imagine the camera man the WHOLE time with kendrick. i would cry lol
2:48 background song name ?
"The praise I have for this performance is immense, on every single level, this was and is pure excellence. Bravo to Kendrick and to each and every single one of his creative team"
2 weeks later
tremendo me encant
"Back again, doing the rounds"
Say Drake .....
"1 diss track, 5 Grammie sand one of the most streamed songs of 2024. There is no coming back for drake"
"Tried fast forwarding two times, had two ads in the beginning and then two for each time I tried to get Not Like US. Six ads in less than 5 seconds. C'mon @YouTube"

""" mussssssssssssssssssssssstaaaaaarrrdddddddddddddddddd"" iconic to say less."
I wish I could like this everytime I watched it. We'd be at 8 mil likes already
Did they add more crowd noises to audio in this video? It also feels like it was remixed with Kendrick's voice being more eerie
I'm still surprised that I've watched it this much since day 1 and still want more .....
"Me and my 22 month old son watch this everyday. Ive always been a Kendrick fan, and now my son will grow up being an even bigger fan! Thank you Kendrick!!"
Boff very good

Okay Ill watch it again
The dancing is amazing. My absolute favorite is during Peekaboo. Gives me chills! 6:09
Crowd dead asf
MUSTAAAAAARRRRRD
comercial que s a desgraaaaaaaaa
He straight up buried Drake that night. Nothing can ever top that. Legendary.
Love this!! So much heart and soul.
Difficulty : Impossible Task : Forget this video existed
Why we still see this masterpiece in blurred 1080p?
I've been here everyday since he performed
"Lan Kendrick, i watch this on my way to work, after work, in the gym and at home several times."
The devious smile when he said hey Drake I hear you like them young
are they no longer offering those 6 months of apple music for $2.99?
Powerful
Mia
MUSTARDDDDDDDDDDD
10:50 say drake
"i dont know how much time i am seeing this, for the past week i am listening to this for 4-6 times a day. still not bored"
"Hey, Queen, you're missing the point entirely! The 92% did it for their ancestors; we've done that kumbaya thing to help everyone; however, it's never reciprocal! When we march for reparations and the passing of the George Floyd and John Lewis bills, etc., no one stands up for us! Black ppl must be our brother's keeper at this juncture; we apprised them about the looming project 25 debacle on the outset of this election! Now, it's their time to march for themselves; the red, poorest, most racist states voted against their best interest. They must fix it themselves, like I said. I'm buying Black and boycotting those businesses that don't support the entrepreneurs in our communities, period! Pls wake up, Queen; our ancestors are watching us, and they are elated by the fact that we're leaning on Yahweh and each other!"
As big as the what?
11:22 Free Palestine Free Sudan

People saying all this bad stuff about Kendricks performance. This is in my top 3 favorite of all time of Super Bowl performances. And I like Kendrick Lamar but Im not even close to being a big fan. I dont know what these people mean. All I can say is go back and watch it again. This time listen to the crowd. Enough said.
11:55 MUSTAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRD!! Youre welcome
"Dake, be humble! Drake, sit down!"
"im not gonna lie, i would have the WORST headache if my opposition in competition had this long of a run of their dislike for me especially if im self-centered and think im the best and no one can top me and im not humble? oof"
"All the Kendrick love aside, whoever was the Cinematographer and the Choreographer deserves an award. Beautifully shot."
2:40
"Enseri que feo show, sin gracia, sin chiste, sin nadaaaaaa"
Its clear as day that everyone skipped to 10:52 .. Say Drake!

"After this, mustard and watermelon will always be linked. 11:55 - 12:35"
this mf tighter than a fkin drum man It cant be overstated
February 2025 anyone?
"Kendrick avoiding the camera the entire performance until ""SAY DRAKE"" is top tier"
so super cool man
That GNX is so clean
He should've done meet the grahams
I just had to come back yoo!!
Re-watched it for like 10 times and still couldn't get over it

The best half time in history
Best Halftime Show of my Generation my parents had Micheal Jackson
The Pulitzer Prize Winner did not disappoint. The man turned a football halftime show into Broadway.
Not a fan of Kendrick don't get me wrong by modern standards he's good but by old school standards he's not even mid. Eric Jamal is the only one from the modern pool that meets the old school standards in my ears.
5x like the chiefs were gonna...
This Feelings

Always RAP
Easily the BEST Super Bowl halftime performance
Helloooo my Americans!!!!!!!!!
Mustaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard 11:55
So Kendrick Lamar sang this song. I remember hearing it on black panther 9:05
"Kendrick Lamar just redefined what a halftime show should be! His energy, the storytelling, and those visuals were pure magic. This performance was more than just a show; it was an experience that brought us all together. If you felt the same, hit that like button! #KendrickLamar #SuperBowl"
Let's get this performance to 100 Million for the culture!
It was very informative
Hey drake watching this
African dance
9: 58 my fav one ...
"Bringing in ""uncle"" sam js creative genius"
"I shouldve known it wasnt real, but I got so caught up in it."
Unpopular opinion but Luther with SZA was the best part
LITINI has been watching this performance since the Super Bowl! Magnificent performance!
Genius Forget about the Drake diss and listen to the American message !!
I watched this an unhealthy amount of times!
Love all the blackness
How many times have you watched this? Yes.
This is my 5th time watching this so good
5:25
"Love it, very classy show and stable singing live"
Game Over
Show looks like a music clip
10:40
Thinking how the set pieces were just like Squid Game which NFL is basically US version of.
less than 48 hrs to get this to 100 million views! do it for the culture hip-hop bka #blackamericanmusic #notlikeus happy black history month!
"What surprises me is that you guys from NFL don't even made subtitles for that to put along with the video in the platform, not even in English, like no one with any kind of disability, or from other countries, or anything like that will watch, just autogenerated."
Hi just rewatching here
All the stars never looked that beautiful .The choreography was at point.
I love it him too
Much appreciation.
I have so much stuff to say but Kendrick wearing the A and mustard wearing the M is crazy!
Cant stop watching this best performance ever

All the stars
Kendrick like the mad michael jackson performing again at the superbowl again
This the best thing that happened all year.
10:53. Thats all.
Kendricks show and super bowl backing him up
the absolute worst superbowl performance i ever seen kendrick payed youtube bots to cover this catastrophe up and added fake likes to this
"Watched it live and it was straight. Coming back to watch it a few more times, certified all time great performance!!!"
Couldnt have been better
Watching it for the 10th time today
This half time show gets better every time its my 43rd time lol
Back here over and over again
9:57
"I could watch this over and over and never get tired. So much depth, so much to see!"
Back again for the 20th time. This is just so satisfying
10:13 best part
J'adore

Amassou esse otario
Culture...A1
Glad to see there was diversity and only blacks...no other race involved in the show in a league that preaches diversity.........LOL
I cant stop watching this
not like us clean is diabolical
honestly give the camera men/women a raise. they made this epic performance more epic
1080p only ??
say drake
Kendrick is King
I need I dont even like you on a T-shirt
100m is near
10:52 bro is cheesing lol
The dancers were amazing.
I notice something different each time I watch this. The artistry is off the chains
He did his Thang
Goated
No speak English but i know that he the ONE forsure
"Kendrick really raised the bar HIGH for every future half time show. I don't know any other artist that could even come close in this way. Not only was this a killer performance, but it also told a story. Best SuperBowl performance ever, hands-down."
"How many times have you watched this? ""Yes"""
The longest funeral
Commenting so hopefully some likes will make me come back to watch this for the 50th time. I wasnt even a huge Kendrick fan until watching this but now I am. Also I love that for the a minor line the entire stadium lights up as well as everyone singing it which is just wild. Im pretty sure he just nuked Drake with this
So glad I lived to see this!
11:56 mustaaaaaaaaardddddd
"Sorry i'm from Germany, but who was that great Lady in the red Leathersuite? what an amazing Voice!"
This man has changed my life for the better. Thank you Kendrick

Why was bro teasing us
Melhor Parte Do Show 10:03
"Its definitely better when you see it twice. Those who dont like it are in denial and jealous, because they werent invited!"
Hes doing so good
Nangiss super baguss
"I am from Sweden and only knows Superbowl having the recent IT star to perform in half time, so this is out of the norm and I LOVE it! Dre, Snoop, Em, Kendrick and 50 was awesome a couple of years ago but I've gotta feeling 2025 and Kendricks' solo performance will be Legendary."
Drake is probably pissed after that
Drake at the VIP room was not liking this at all
Genius
Ive lost track of how many times I watched this lol oh well
"Usually with halftime shows, theyre really fun to watch but i dont ever really rewatch them- I watch this every other day at least, its just that good"

You did so good
GTA code in the beginning is crazy
The fact when he said A MINOR everyone said it thats crazy
:)
This will forever be an instant pick-me-up performance!
"Keeping watching this halftime show, more than the Super Bowl highlights"
"People say that the SuperBowl 2025 was bad, but Kendrick cooked with the superbowl. While people just made the superbowl like a concert(no hate to the other superbowls), Kendrick made it into a story, which made it the best superbowl in a long time."
10:53 = The reason we're all here
Best 13 minutes of hip hop!!! Kendrick thank you!!
"""They not like us"""
Whos here after Drake just included this in his defamation . Kendrick: I like to perform a favorite song but you know they like to sue .

Youtube AD timestamps: 4:10 & 8:30
Sza
10:00
I'm still waiting for him to put his family on his mind. Never ask about info regarding their cultivation. Never grabbing scrolls or nothing for them.

It's your Uncle Sam
Hello again. This halftime show has free reign in my head now.
IT'S JUST......SO PEAK.......

Bigger than what?
ALL the women were fully clothed. A complete win
This should be on Spotify as 1 song
Nice to see all of you again!

This is a great performance !!!!!!
Best interval show of all time
What was the song where he dang with the girl in red

8:29 Rip Chadwick
You really about to do it? *YES JUST LET ME DISS DRAKE INFRONT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY*
POV:if I was drake man that smile
Most adds I've ever seen in a 13 min vid
I wanna perform their fav
"Absolute Perfection!!!!! I have seriously lost count of how many times I've watched this Work of Art, and each time, it speaks to me in a different way. Wow. Kendrick Lamar was phenomenal. This is what happens when a Pulitzer Prize Winner comes to deliver a message."
Woh
I do think his mic should have been lending Louder
I WAS SCREAMING SZAAAA
When siza came in i started to cry shes so bueatiful and Amazing
Apa bagusnya cok Cuman lihat orang jelek nyanyi Kaya kuli bangunan
5:00 edition was low key on point
"Its really crazy how Drake really put a lot of people on just for them to turn on him. Even his fans doing him dirty when a lot of these artists they like wouldnt be up there if it wasnt for him. And as much as I love Kendrick, hes really the one who started the beef when he dissed him on big Seans track. He didnt have to do all that he couldve kept it under wraps but chose not too. And when Drake retaliated he became the bad guy and now everyone is against him. Oh how the tables have turned on Drake unfortunately the fact that Drake also put Kendrick on the map too is even crazier he brought asap and him together to make the song problem and featured Kendrick on a couple albums"
Anyone else got the steps on lock?
10:54 made me laugh
Oyaaaa msenge anaimba kishenzi mamaeeee
Hjj
It may be 2 weeks now but in a blink this gonna be 1 year old
Not serine crip wallkin

The whole production of this was unreal. From the performance to the cameramen The lighting and sound was sick also.
"Someone said ""it was nice of Kendrick to let a football game happen at his concert""."
Backkk againn
14.3 million subscribers? I know why.
Damm
"OK show, liked the Diss but, nothing spectacular. The background dancers and singers severely missing that beloved diversity, or does that only go one way?"
"You can do anything you want, you'll never have as much class as drake"

I actually believed this for a solid minute well played!
I watch this at least once a week I love this performance its just spectacular.
Has anyone mentioned that the opening lights were the PlayStation button pad? As if to say what Kendrick is interrupting is just a game?
Here for my daily dose
"Kendrick is too dope, much love from Europe!"
This is horrible what is this

Best superbowl halftime of the century
Amerika kuragi rasisnya ke warna kulit

"Started... ""Drake started suing, now we're here"""
10:16 the girl dancers did their thing!
"Considering the beef with Drake started in March 2024, this is the longest funeral I've ever seen yeah !!!"
Wait wait waitik mustards name start with an mbut you telling me dot had the a and mustard had the m for minor.that would be insane
Boring.
This was terrible.
I really really like that performance and it is the greatest of all the time.let the haters talk.There's the only thing they can do
A minoooor
kendrick and Serena went great together
Whenever I need to smile I come watch this. When I need that warm and fuzzy feeling.
boa....kakke.... schade...!!!!
Seriously? This is what all the fuss is about? It's gibberish. Pretending to be important political/cultural commentary. Still gibberish.
So hot man
It's not your first time here
"Kendrick's smile at 7:08 is also gold, he knew he's about to cook"
The A minor all the the dancers stand like a A. Realy K dot is the genius he thinks he is. Waiting for you in France. Chris

Every time I see this Im more impressed by the symbolism and technical skill
I will go outside ad shout a minor on loud Speakers for 24 hrs if drake comments on this
Dont worry his tv was off Lol
IF THE PEOPLE TRULY WANT MORE POLITICAL RAP AND CONSCIOUS RAP GENRE FOR NFL HALFTIME THEN SPEAK UP CAUSE KENDRICK LAMAR ISN'T THE ONLY ONE. BRING IN OUT OTHER SIMILAR ARTISTS TO PERFORM. LOL.

I live here @ this point
I love Kendrick Lamar
"Fans of just the music & true performers, this was for US."
MUSTARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Love How Kendrick has made sure Mustard
nh z tr
Kendrick woke up and decided to take a victory lap on national TV.
"I feel like the people who complain about this performance should know that Kendrick isnt a simple person. To add more, the people who complained that hes not performing his popular songs are just furthering his point of his performance"
10:00
Sabiri
THEE PANTS ARE NOT IT

Starting animation was sick
Still watching?

I guess this is a plan
fazendo minha visita diria aqui
9:51
You know your rap career is over when the artist you're beefing with sings his number 1 hit song calling you a predator on national TV during the most watched sports events and everyone singing alone. Kendrick stays winning.
yo
Very bad
Why am i so addicted to this
This halftime show is a Masterpiece I don't think they knew it would be this great
Bro this is a w better than the actual song they had so much power in those lyrics absolutely amazing
Whoaaahhh
"Man, Kdot did his thing and the camera man went all the way up."
It was nice of Kendrick to let the liddle widdle football teams play their ball game at his searing legendary concert
Somali ma joogtaa
Mustard on the beat
and PEPSI????
Here we go again!
Who here again?
My twentieth time coming back here Ill be back again when it hits 100m views
Why is he wearing bootcut jeans
Big as the what?
Who is saying this is bad? This is the best superbowl performance Ive EVER SEEN
"10:52 That smile kendrick does when he says, ""hey drake"" gets me everytime"
"For all those who said they didn'tunderstand anything, hear this , it was born out of their American experience, their America , and you haven't been listening, therefore not assimilating. But hey, it's ok if it goes the other way, y'know, play by YOUR rules and all that. Keep up or fall out. That game is over."
Ok ken u only have 13:24 minutes to show yourself to the world Ken:
Tobagoian Trini 26 February 2025

Im listening to this for the fifth time
Why this the worst halftime show ever
Press F for Drake
"The messages behind the things happening are beautiful, but, of course, also incredibly funny when the entire crowd knew the assignment"
Well all the singing and dancing did not get us any where. The government rich just cut all our lifelines. This was for drake anyway.

"I know a lot of us thought he wasn't going to do... NOT LIKE US, but why not?. 5 GRAMMYS. Okay!"
Hi

"lets be honest if they gave it to kesha or demi lavato it would have been way better, this was boring"
Cant believe i get to see him live soon
10:16
Horrible racist c rap
This has been living in my mind rent free since it was aired
Guy is talented big tune
This was the last Superbowl halftime show my Uncle saw before he passed. He died the next day once he knew for sure I would carry on & care for my mom(his sister) the way he did.
The best super bowl so far
Blessings loving it...
Who else is back to rewatch the best SB halftime performance?!
"Drake lawyers just added the superbowl performance to the lawsuit against UMG stating ""Hes suffering even more now"" Kendrick Lamar is the Goat"

Asia loves to consume dogs
Cringe.
"Is it just me or he is also proving to Drake that he is the actual MJ? The gloves, the dances... Maybe I'm tripping, but the idea is actually genius"
I SURVIVED COVID TO SEE THIS MOMENT
Compton been putting it down selling records since 87 underground
KINGGGGGGGG LAMAR
This is hatred on a level that not even Dio or Frieza can comprehend. This is a level of diabolical that should not be on this Earth. Not even Thanos can comprehend this eradication.
That see no evil hear no evil speak no evil siiickazzfuk
back again too
That's a real masterpiece
11:54 Kendrick announces his favorite condiment
Why am I back here AGAIN????
"I have watched this no cap as soon as the video was released, even scheduled a time since I'm in the Philippines and man, since this performance was released I have watched this at least 30 times. The more I rewatch, the more I understand the ingenuity of this performance. It's simple, but Kendrick really have used the songs to create a story. He could have easily put on a show for his famous songs only. But he went out and beyond orchestrating the whole thing. Besides the famous song being released on my birthday last year, this performance really made me a Kendrick fan. His albums stood the test of time. GNX is now my new favorite album. You really cannot beat someone that is a product of the culture. Kendrick, you're a legend. Keep making art. I'm glad you're now getting the recognition that's rightfully yours. P.S. still new to hiphop but I'm also discovering new artists. :)"
"Even though Kendrick's concert already happened, legend still says that there's still Micheal fans cheering for him."
The revolution is about to be televised!!!!!
My new nightly routine w my
Back back back back back BACK AGAIN!!!
SAY DRAKE
Greatest of all time.

10:00 What youre actually here for
Imagine having a whole Super Bowl dissing bout u
7:26 what song ?
The Man In The Garden part is highly underrated

". Kendrick, Lamar is back Rock n roll"
Who else plays this at least once a day since it happened?
Y'all I watch this EVERY NIGHT. Can't get enough. Amazing Kendrick Bro.
They try to Rig the game but you cant fake influence is a bar
10:20 ele tem o molho
"59th time watching this ... Hey, what were the ""light"" words in the beginning, and how'd they do that? Anybody know?"
"My guess is apple produced this, they did an amazing job as they always do... apple has a way to create a ""vibe"" that has their finger print all over it. I was really curious as to what the olympics 2026 show will be like, and i can see the us will probability have huge streaming and producing media giants host it and produce it."
I come back every week to watch this and each time theres like 10M more views than the previous week

Play Station made a cameo. There should be a new Madden game where theres a halftime mode
Mustarddddddddddsdd
Drake could never
The way he looked in the camera when he said hey drake
"Wow, I grew up in the 80s so 80s and 90s music was my thing. But this, this was amazing ... First time I can say an artist took me on a journey and told a story to my soul. God bless this brother, few will be with his message, many will be against it"
Came here for the 'say drake' part but ends up watching it all
8:40 rip Chadwick boseman
HULU LANA RHOADES KENDRICK LAMAR
"Uncle Sam, U.S. get it? Uncle Sam is the embodiment of America"
Came back for another dose of this hot fire. 13:24
The cameraman deserves a raise for following along with the whole performance so smoothly. I keep circling back to this video to watch it all again.
Crazy how many Easter eggs are in this performance
Enough time has past this was the best Super Bowl performance of all time.
The fact that Serena Williams drakes ex was doing the crip walk had me dead-
I'm a 54 yo boricua and I just can't get enough of this halftime show hands down the best I've seen
People saying this is the a horrible halftime show are liberals who want pdf.iles labeled as maps.
I LITERALLY make it a point to watch this every single day (Not Like Us)
The car is the car he went to the hospital but the same brand
9:50
10:53 say drake
Imagine this song in GTA 6
I just found kendrick and boy I love his songs. Can someone please write the name of the songs?? I want to listen to their original versions.
"Have you ever walked your enemy down with a p*ker face?! Later.. Says, Hey Drake, with same smile"
Mastuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaardddddddd
No hate! But that walk was kind of fruity!

The best Halftime Show in History!
"I love it when all my favorite songs are in one youtube video, that i can download, with only my favorite parts, and sneaky lyrics, awesome intermissions that boost my endorphins, and live mix from kendrick himself"

Did you see the nonchalant dread head next to Kendrick during be humble?
"Almost 90 million, let's get to 150 before this month end."

The Family Matter and the truth of the matter. It was God's plan to show yall the liar

I cant go a day without watching this video!
Drake here. Just want you to know Im suing anyone reading these comments.
This is addictive and brilliant in so many ways!
"Considering this is a halftime show. The replay value this holds is incredible. Ive watched this around 6 times already, and everytime I watch it, its like I notice something else. This performance is ART people."
9:02 this performance is so good. Talented dancers and singers
Epic!!!
Back My Childhood
I have the feeling that many people hid in the car just to avoid paying the ticket for the Super Bowl
what was the first song?
"Yeah this is the greatest halftime show performance, CINEMA!"
My favourite started from here 11:46
"Oh. So that's what everyone is saying is the best time show. I.... disagree. It was mid, at best. Expected better from Mr. Lamar. But the dancers were great. C+."

D.R.A.K.E means... Don't Rap Against Kendrick Ever
Sza & Serena

10:53 the part you guys are waiting for

This soundtrack should be introduced as the intro on every album released by Kendrick from now on
**.!
Who else is here in 2026?
Whats the song he sang at 4:48
"I think Im the only one who made 100,000 views on the video by watching it every day on repeat"

"From Brasil... Que msica louco... Esses dois passinhos alternados , com as minas junto, ficou demais ...."
"i'm here again after fiding the 4 KDot Angels on tiktok, these ladies gave a fantastic performance!"
Epic
"No idea what a super bowl is, zero knowledge of rap. But this is nicely choreographed"
"""Say Drake """

rediculos !!
Uncle sam
All I know is that we better be blasting TV Off during the revolution.
Please pin me heart my comment ahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Kendrick & my favorite singer Sza There performance amazing hi Nfl your my favorite football sport show
How many people are in the car? 1:10 people are still coming out
"Kendrick Lamar's show is far behind Michael Jackson's. Kendrick showed no performance, no energy. Nothing compared to the King, whose charisma, staging, and intensity are unmatched. Michael Jackson remains and will always be the master of the show!"
It was not only bout music but also bout culture.
"Hey culture! Dont come for me, as this is my fiftieth time watching this! My daughter is making me wear headphones to listen now!"
Anyone from Tanzania
Kendrick Lamars saying is ay
This was boring to be very honest
I deserve it all womp womp womp womp
This was my introduction to Kendrick Lamar. The entire performance is hypnotic; I cant stop watching it.

"I'm Brazilian and I'm going to come back here to watch this show until I'm sick of it, Kendrick inspired me a lot and it's about time I made a song inspired by him!"
:22 - Is the intro to Wacced Out Murals. Which is a middle finger to anyone not happy about him getting the Superbowl halftime show

Its going to be hard to top this next year.
Way too much censored...
I know it made science to do but I fear the Uncle Sam was kinda annoying because youll be listening to the music and then Samuel just comes out of nowhere and is like 9:48 like it was funny the first time but then it was a little much
Born like this
This is crazeyyyyyy
The pressure has eaten me up like every beat
fts
"When you think of Rap Artists making music thatll last a lifetime, you cannot say that Not Like Us isnt that. From LL Mama Said Knock You Out, Fresh Prince Summer Time, MC Hammer You Cant Touch This and so many more. This will last forever!"

"Dissed Drake so hard, bro started singing hooks in Spanish on his new album"

"This was such an amazing performance omg, imagine winning a Grammy and performing at the Super Bowl halftime show."
Who else is watching this after 2 weeks?
"I'm from France, never watched the halftime show, but i can't even tell you how many times i've watched this one ! As a mixed black person, i feel proud to have someone like him speaking for the black community."
"Had it on subtitles he says ""Cedric I hear you like em young""."
Watching this at least once every single day for the next 4 years (my 2yo makes me watch it more )

"10:17 brother, it's really transmitting the aura!!!"
"Kendrick doing what he does best, have to feed the soul and watch this HIPHOP cultural masterpiece"
"Voice cadence, body moves, eye contact..Kdot's excellent at Dranatic Poetry in school. I can tell."
09:48
"Love eet! Kdot's moves at 1.55. Yeah, i know. i'm here again."
Did he say turn TV off ???
This is CULTURE
Hes so brilliant
America servant to black peaple
"the performance is super good, but am I the only person who thinks his performance is a bit zesty?"
The running when perfoming DNA and that walk
hell yeaaaaah!!!
The forced hate this performance got from the night it premiered was some bull. I can't tell you how many times I've came back since. It's already legendary.
This is one thee best Super Bow Halftime Shows. Def feel compelled to stream that GNX and others. - someone not a huge fan of Kendrick
"Its not you first time here, I know it"
Just leaving a comment just because...
"For the statistics - I am palm colored, hate football, grew up 15min outside of Philly, and didn't even know there was a halftime show in the Superbowl until this year. Even with everything else to drag me to watch the Superbowl, I did not, but this 13min performance? I have lost count on how many times I've watched this."
Almost forgot to watch this today..
A minoooooooooooor
A minoooor
"Luther#1 on Billboard Hot 100 Congratulations, Kendrick & SZA!"

"""say drake, i hear u like em young"" while he was smiling to the camera was absolutely devious, bro put the final nail in the coffin"
Dont ever disrespect sza by cutting her off with a ad again not on my phone!
Disgusting what people once labeled with integrity does for money these days
When he says Say Drake with that smile at the camera was diabolical and I loved every minute of it! Well done!
Here again. This performance was so dope. like a live music video with a story
MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHRD!!
"Im not famous, now I know what to d exactly. Make some music talking about Dreak"
13:12 game over is barely visible in the crowd
the corners of america that play a piece to fill in the spots i love where im from and everything it brings to the table !!!
"As a yellow-skinned Asian living in Taiwan, the show made me feel proud to be Blackif that makes sense."
Video xem sng qu tri
"I can watch this performance a million times. It's so satisfying.the lyrics, Kendrick,SZA, the dancers. SOOOO MESMERIZING"
pure gold
Im obsessed with this
Love love love loveI love he who captures my heart and mind. Daddy....with integrity...
Be humble and sit down
So who's buying tickets to his tour after seeing this?
Michael Jackson
Bruh ive been watching all angles of this half time its the GOAT i cant get over
https://youtube.com/@arthurtuyishime?si=X7Ormu6iPN5-OKnK
Le state reste le state
"Wow.... Kendrick walk... and shake hips... walk again... even a dying dog move better... jay z is without the brain, a poor brainless trendsetter..."
Wait. Which team won the superbowl
Legendary.
10:17 MOST REPLAYED
Nice
sza
MUSTAAAAAAAARRRRDDDD
10th times Coming back
Kendrick had to turn the lights off on the crowd knowing itd expose him with a dead crowd
amazing
Love this performance
I've been going back since it got uploaded hereeeee. I love the songs
"Question, is that MC Lyte doing the intro and outro Apple Music Voice over?"
Money trees grew and grew. His momma must be so proud!
Hello
Following Me It's Ok...!!!
So you going to question that @Yall know better...!!! Terrell
This is worst than what Drake did to Meek
I just cant stop coming back to this. This is an important performance. The revolution was indeed televised.
"Back again, for it"
Best half time show ever
It's his turn GB
Fake influence then
"I cant even count how many times Ive watched this. Kendrick hit so much, so hard and so love/lively. What an amazing man. Showing so much more than the eye can see. What an absolute LEGEND."
disgustingly good
The fact he said the 'A Minor' part while wearing an A chain was golden.
Peekaboo is my favorite part of the performance
yup here go my 84 millionth time watching it
5:17 walked your enemy down like with a Poker Face Kenny intentionally smiles here
The red button
"Needs subtitles. Josh Johnson did a pretty good explanation of the hidden messages in this performance; it really about trying to send a message without the message getting caught by the censors. Plus a lot of disses of Drake, including having Serena there."
Kendrick definitely knows how to share the spotlight
This is a masterpiece no doubt
Didn't listen to much Kendrick until seeing this performance
10:53 Say Drake
As days go by i realise this show is gooood!!
THAT SMILE WAS DIABOLICAL
Kendrick need to release a not like us with the girls singing
Im back again guys
amazing
Waoooo excelente!!!
rewatching this im so invested in this controversy behind this halftime show i cant tell if people just wanted to make a theory out of nothing or could this really mean something? america is hilarious.
Excelente!!!!
We here again fam
YAY!!! Fire Kendrick Lamar!!!!
Musterd!!!!
Im back
ayo i'm back
Culture cheat code score keeper deduct one life
NEVER GETS TIRED. BLACK JOY.
Best performance ever!!!
this is a nightly ritual
He was literally the best on it like I watched the entire thing and like I like the part when like SZA was like singing thats my favorite part because I was watching it. Im definitely gonna be watching another one like this so yeah I love it.
God knows how many times Ive watched this performance
"Was seeing snips of this performance & finally thought I had to see the whole thing, guess whos here now & gonna punch that replay button repeatedly."
It was so tuff at the start when he was on the car and he was like dabadado
This is my 7th or 8th time watching me and my girl love watching it this is a classic
Two weeks have past and I keep coming back to see what symbolism I missed out on the first 25 times I watched this performance. This man is a genius. I guess that's why he is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
Who is still watching?
The fact that all dancers are black make me love it even more
"How much more I watch, more I love it"
"I know Drake was having a temper tantrum at home, texting his lawyers"
"dont mind me, i just come here for the 14th time"
He fit like 60 people in that car
The entire performance had so many political undertone
I cant get over this performance
"When Samuel L Jackson says ""Don't mess this up"", it almost looks like he was about to say don't F this up"
Still in love with this whole show
Kameraman ok iyi i karm
Are we talk about how Lamar took more steps than the chiefs did the whole game.
TRU..

"5:14 Have you ever watched your enemy down, with a POKER FACE He gives the same poker face when he says ""hey Drake"""
This is the sickest performance ever for kendrick this is prime example of comptons legends

This hits different when cleaning the kitchen
"I really love how kendrick was able to add a lot of story into this preformance, whilst also pleasing the fans and overall doing an amazing choreographed and preformed halftime"
"something that i dont see enough love for is the intro and outro song being the old guard is dead by ghais guevara. amazing song, insane production quality, and criminally underrated artist. some of his songs have only 500 views, even though he was in the super bowl halftime. how can you ignore this insane beat?!"

"he was really explosive that day, i've watched this video countless times but still get goosebumps from the feeling of that day"
Everyone was hating on this show it wasnt bad

The whole stadium and millions of others singing A Minor in unison like that was crazy. America hasnt been that united since Pearl Harbor
"Feb 24. Wow, I really thought I would be tired of watching this performance by now but I'm back here again...for like the 50th time!. PgLang, dancers, and crew did an amazing job. I guess I will be back Maana."

When they started to sing all the stars I look to my mom and said I really wish Chadwick boseman was still alive that was the first time I ever heard the song in the credits of black panther I know it's been years but rest in peace Chadwick Boseman
Kendrick really went off that night mane
"When kendrick said "" life goes on I need all my babies I KNOW what that meant https://youtu.be/RvY5iMhtk-g?si=syYA3zx6gCMPR1BE"
I dont think a man was ever able to collectively convince America to scream MUSTAAAAAARD in their living rooms until Kendrick came along
Im here like gazillion times man !! Addictive
Lol hey drake
I might as well keep this tab open seeing as I'm back here almost every day.
9:50 my fav and best
"Drake's iust gotta give up now, he just got dissed at the super bowl"
This is definitely going to pass a billion views after a few more months. I lost track of the amount of time rewatching this video
The revolution about to televised. Turn this tv off
Love visual effect perfection
This is what you call Timeless
Kendrick has always been jealous of Drake. Dude had 2 hit records before 2024 when he dissed Drake. Clout chasing west coast
Young people don't know what good music is.

"Pa|estin fIag 11:57 And again at 12:22 (directly after when Kendrick says fIag be getting thrown, ironically) Man getting tackled at 12:27 Man getting crowded by $uits at 12:31"

Peekaboo
"ABURRIDO, PLANO, RACISTA, CUANTA RAZON LO DE ""CASTAS"""
"No Aura at all, where at the Crowds? wtf xD"
Drake went to sleep
"Oh my word twitter is filled with miserable, bitter liars! This performance was INCREDIBLE lmao also Kai Cenat going on stream lying and saying the crowd was quiet when we can clearly hear them throughout jokes on him for allowing drake to use him like that."
Its 02-24-25 and Im STILL replaying thissssssssss!!!!!

Funny thing is i thought this was the first time sza sang live cause I heard gossip of many saying sza don't sing live.

Imagine looking back on this and its about the beef with Drake instead of Kendricks own catalog and his great hits. Wasted time and energy. Remember this comment.

This needs to be ARCHIVED and put into a museum to be viewed for GENERATIONS
"MAD PROPS to the dancers, the ""you really bout' to do it'"" ladies, the producers, camera people, for keeping up with K-Dot, the custom designers, the set designers, and of course K-Dot for running the length of the football field and not sounding like it, on a PHENOMENAL SHOW for the halftime @ Superbowl 2025!!!!! OUTSTANDING!!!!!"
10:02 best part
8:15 fav part
Bro tiktok is finna go crazy about this
Im so surprised that how people ignored the line 40 acres and a mule such a powerful line and the way he used in here is really commendable.
I werent overly excited when I heard that K Dot was doing Super Bowl as I only know a handful of songs. But lemme tell you this Beyonce beehive member has watched this performance more than Beyoncs & shes amazing! But man that peekaboo has me in a chokehold!
Best show ever!!!

2025 is a year where the main title song in a superbowl halftime performance is a DISS track about another HIGH level artist being a pdf..... strange times.......
"Hitting It and Jamming with some FUNK ,,,"
"Best performance ever! I'm not a rap fan, but this was highly entertaining! I've watched it multiple times just for fun."
one of the most viral halftime shows
"YESSSSSSSS,,,,,"
"The first time Im watching Super Bowl in my life, this Is BLACK EXCELLENCE . This is history made."
Kenya is proud of you
"This was the WORST halftime show I have ever witnessed! NFL, WTH are you doing?"
Ill never get over this.
I wondered why ppl expect loud noise from the audience at funeral. - RIP Drake
Watched this an unhealthy amount of times. Send help

"What a masterpiece of a performance, as with Michael Jackson's, there's a before and after. From now on, its not enough (pun intended) to just have fireworks and a marching band heheheh"
The number of times i have re- watched this is insane. It never gets old.

"11:57. Mustard's entrance was one of the most iconic entrances I've ever seen, after Lil Yachty's walk out."
09:58
Bueno
Why do the ads always play during szas solo
"For me this ties with KDOT as #1. However, the symbolism here was 100% love!"
This entire performance gave boss fight energy
Im trying to find something to watch and all of these short videos about this Super Bowl keeps bringing me back
This is part of the daily playlist at this point

Yall peep coming under the floor to the car
The smile on my face throughout this performance..
Sup Drake was CRAZY
Amazing prsentation 100%. KL creatitivity.
Yall theres a rumor going around that NFL sent Lil Wayne an apology because of the performance but the NFL wallpaper is literally Kendrick Lamar coping hard.
"Look, I love Drake. It's hard not to love this performance"
Someone explain to me why were racist if we didnt enjoy this is think it was anything to write home about? Im new here
dnyann en haval insan olabilir hayran kaldm
"Teens will always create art that maximizes annoyance of their elders. Rap music is very difficult, actually. Crazy complicated rthymically. I woke up one day, and I liked it."
Its been a few days but we back lol
"Boring to me. Was it all the same song in beginning. It all goes on a same beat, 1,2,3.all songs sounded similar.im not a fan but didn't notice anything different about his songs until the girl sang and the famous it's not like us. Other than that, nope.other ppl had better shows"
crazy how the audience is also bored and confused and uninterested. /s
"14 days since this masterpiece dropped, and I can't stop replaying!"
I keep coming back and I don't regret it at all
This is what the US has to offer: Purely embarrassing. Seems to get worse every year. Poor excuse for a show.
Back here for the fourth time
"No idea who this guy is, but happy he put on a very elaborate performance that was well done!"
His smile is ADORABLE! This is one of my favorite SB half time shows
Talking about talent

Poetic Justice

7:44 hardest entry
6:10 what's with this part everytime I watch i got Goosebumps.
Mustard popped out like the certified boogie man
Have to see this atleast once a day.
Worst Super Bowl half time show ever. These YouTube comments are all bots Nobody actually liked this
Kendrick dissing Drake was so satisfying and Serena crip- walking was lika a cherry on top
1 man shouldn't have all that power!. ..
"I think for how overplayed not like us became, Kendrick nailed the performance for that song specifically. Loved the entire performance too"
https://youtu.be/z9sRKnXWL1I
40 arces and a mule is bigger then the music
11:45 gives me the chills every time
My God this was not a Superbowl this was a earthquake Kendrick Lamar shook the world with this one give this man his flowers now not tomorrow here u go baby
The best ever diss track. I dubbed this DISS TRACK OF THE MILLENIUM.

You stole my Bay Areas HYPHY rights.
"1 white person in the whole performance. If the shoe was on the other foot. But obviously they were the best dancers and they who cares if they all black, just like who cares if the next is all white. Then then next after that is all Asian."
got this is so iconic
9:56 it's when started what you came for
This is by far the best Super Bowl Half time show i have ever seen
Kendrick is 5'5
"Prince, MJ and Dot got the most legendary halftime shows of all time"
100/100
were Drake
"11:17 Freddy Fazbear manages to get the whole crowd to hate on Purple Guy, colorized 2015"
Serena isn
"I mustve been working so much lol due to my medical job how in the heck did I miss the beef he had with Drake ?? I had no idea but as I break his video down and look at it from a whole different view.. some say it was inspired from a PlayStation controller etc but thats what they us to believe This was a simple but truthful perfectly executed! The absolute payback to Drake, especially having both his e(X)s there but theres something else.. This was also a tribute to xxxtentacion. But KL knows something about a little something meaning Drake got his hand caught in the cookie jar - he was behind something-something- so to make the X as part of show and bringing Drakes Xs .- I think KL did an amazing job and This tribute/Payback to Drake was long overdue"
Esta Cancin no sale de mi cabeza
11:20 THE CROWD
Bro has some investments to make #His guffy moves
Can we give it up for the camera man?! SUPERB WORK all the way through!
"Meanwhile, there are so many TikTok vids of ppl showing their hate for this amazing halftime performance which is sad. Thanks NFL for this historic viewing. Now go apologize to Kaep"
Kendrick is fire as expected but is SZA is amazing. I thought no way was she seeing live
The breath control and stamina is absolutely amazing. All respect to Kendrick truly
I cant leave out Sza!she did a fantastic job.. This whole show was just perfect from beginning to end!
Where tf mustard came from...
Gave him 13 minutes talk about perfect utilisation
Such a talented young man!!! This halftime show was awesome!!! This is only about my 5th time watching it
Poor drake
The most seen funeral ever
Another playback boy.
"Best super bowl performance ever! Y'all other artists need to learn from Kendrick. Non-Violent, extremely talented entertainment. Also, fully clothed respectable women. Love it!"
Did you love it I did 10 I love Kendrick Lamar
So we just not gonna talk about how did they all fit in the car
We need chris brown on the next halftime show
! !
10:54 THE BEST
6:11
"I come back several times a day to watch this, absolutely hooked! How anyone thinks this is boring is beyond me. Even my mum loves it"
excellent performance
2:32 hey dot can i get a drop? NO

5 times now
Mustaaaaaaaaaaaaaaardddddd
and i come here often
10:09
the way i see it. 'Kendrick shot a music video at the superbowl and invited all the celebrities behind- the- scenes' #kungfu kenny
Fun fact: Half the audience lost their wallets during half time!
game over
Whats the first song he performed plz ?
"One more time, ( for the third time )..."
Idk lady Gaga had more views
Ive watched 10 commercials trying see this 15 min video YouTube do better smh
"I've enjoyed this so much! I wish I could give a million more thumbs up. Alas, I only get one vote. I keep watching this."
11:58 peep the Palestine and Sudan flags!!! <3
"""say DRAKE"""
The camera work is top class
Man his music is just really bad.
Okay Im here again!
Never ever
"KDot, Mustag bringing to the stage it was a truely blessing recognition to his brother. Thats the hood black culture spirit; giving love back to you homies."
Some messages in the song about the trappings of capitalism are you kidding me Samuel Jackson and Lamar all muti million airs
I think I have a problem. I am here every single day.
That zombie wall was good tho
Kendrick Lamar - WHAT ARE THOUSEEEEE
"Shout to Jigga Man, Hov, we must recognize his effort great job."
Watching 10X times still enjoying like for the first time
"Many critics, but everbody watching the video 10 times at least... Kendrick Lamar gets the goal..."
I like when Kendrick say the favorite song
The kid is genius hands up
9:28 SOLANA #truefriendship #shoutouts #SZA #Kdot #Kendrick
I'm back watching again...
When are you coming to Tampa?
When serena's part starts? Thanks
He is so funny
This is the best superbowl ever
"I have always been a very HUGE fan of Kendrick. Under the artistic word play is a true poet and lyricist. Not to mention a phenomenal performer!!! This man will NOT disappoint, I promise you."
They try to rig the game but you cant fake influence the perfect quote to describe this
I could watch this everyday
"I can NOT believe anyone liked this halftime show. Take time to go back to other halftime shows and take a GOOD look at all the costume changes, stage setups and creative performance. This show had NONE of that. It was the WORST halftime show I have EVER seen. A good example would be , go back to 2015 and watch Katy Perrys' halftime show."
My mom said i watched an unhealthy amount of times ...and i come back again lol
BRO I LOVE UNCLE SAM
Im back here to watch
I remember watching this live. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
Truly outstanding.
"As much as I appreciate the performance, the Buick GNX on stage is the star for me"
Bravo j adore !
Kidda
"He really thought he was ending Drake , Drake # 1 album again 2 weeks later after his so called funeral"
Notorious ! Et pack ! Je suis fire d tre black France
Drake ! Et kendrick ! pour l oppression ! Martin lut! Mohamed Ali !
Drake ! Et kendrick ! pour l oppression ! Martin lut! Mohamed Ali !
L Amrique appartient au indiens ! Et les black ! Beyonce la queen
Horrible
Two weeks later and I'm still hooked
Say Drake 10:52
I wonder how many times Drake watched this?!?!?
The GNX trailer needs to be released... those violins... JUST WOW. I can't stop listening to this part on repeat.
Yep.. I had to get a dose of this performance to remind me Im not being petty enough! K Dot really is the greatest of all time
"I can't get enough of this, best half time show ever %"
The amount i re-watched this is unhealthy Kendrick is the GOAT
Who else here again 2 weeks later
"I feel like Kendrick Lamar was the perfect response to Trump's attendance and request. ""fine we'll get rid of the 'end racism end zone ,' in return we'll have Kendrick Lamar perform the halftime show!!"
Top shaela top quality live mix tape apple u a boss of de world
.
GAME OVER
"Rest in peace, Chadwick Boseman x"
The best halftime show ever
"Its February 24, 2025 and I still cant get enough!"

MUSTARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

yawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn................................................
miorn
10th watch
Music is fine. Rap is good but nowadays alot of skilled rappers exist. Not mind-blowing. Popularity always seem to outshine talent imo.
Then having 2 songs in the newest Captain America movie that was released in the same week!
"I've seen that young man twice, and I can confidently say this GNX tour is going to be historic. Five Grammys for just one diss track? That's an incredible achievement that speaks volumes!"
Am watching this every morning to get going
6:20
"Everybody ate with this performance: Kendrick Sza the dancers including Serena the camera men the choreograper, costume designer and producers behind the scenes Everybody!!!"

"You will never see a halftime show like this drakes Ex crip walking, Sza and Kendrick all the stars luther and etc NOT LIKE US, HUMBLE ye drake Definitely turned his TV off."
The end iss sooo fireeee
They skilled it
This is on my play list!!!! FIRST TIME IN LIFE LOOKING AT THE HALFTIME AND NOT THE GAME!
"Don't mind me, I'm just here for my daily dose of this work of art"
Kendrick decided to awaken xxxtentacion's spirit to haunt Drake
This is how you do revolution in the US today.
The class: is listening to the teacher in silence Me: MUSTAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRD
Yeah back here again
"5:58 I'm trying to figure out why ""TIME"" keep taking me down through there! I feel it every time i watch this show! Some people say he was tired but i call it ""PASSION""! It reminds me of the silent cry and the silent laugh!"
Its sad that this is even considered for halftime.
Whos here after seeing peakaboo true meaning?

Mustaaaaaaard
Burnt fallen angels
describe the vibes
"I've never really watched superbowl halftime shows, and normally just watch the highlights, but I've gotta say, this show is just too good. The artistry, the themes! I had to watch it myself in full to really experience it. Can't say I've ever listened to much rap, but colour me a fan of Kendrick! And SZA! What incredible vocal control!"
"Every time i come back to this, it sounds better"
"11:36, K-dot, we can very well say, Drake is no longer your friend."
Kendrick is MVP
Anyway watching this today?
"Wow 84 million views, phenomenal"
Deve ser um dia bem triste para o Drake

Sza clearly isnt singing live. Thats disappointing especially because she only has like 2 parts and she doesnt dance or do anything too physical.
10:02
the longest funeral in the world
Next year Super Bowl Halftime Show different music
being in the crowd for the halftime must be a huge cultural reset. I'm jealous
"I'm here again, this is what the culture is feeling!"
Fox for sure messed up the audio on live. This sounds amazing on Apple Music!
The music is good. I don't understand why no white people or Latinos participate? Was the show recorded in Nigeria?
Keren juga mamat alkatiri
This is all it takes for me to love Kendrick and SZA

AMAZING & AWESOME TY KENDRICK FOR TRUTH N POWER STAY SAFE & BLESSED LOVE UR BODY OF MUSIC
this mfer wanted blood came for blood and GOT THAT BLOOD WITH THAT DEVIOUS SMILE
Speechless
Honestly I think this is the time for Kendrick Lamar to visit RSA
When was the last time a wrapper got the whole super bowl halftime clip to themselves?
"It's been 2 weeks, but I still come back here every day. The more I watch, the more I find this performance amazing. I've never rewatched a Super Bowl halftime show this many times before. And the cameraman also deserves a round of applause, as they have done their job very well."
I'm back
10:52
Back
this is......fake
9:58 WE CAME FOR THIS AND THIS 11:46
Bro there's no way the viewer count went up 2M while watching this shi*
"I love how old people didnt like the show. It's okay, not all of us saw the message behind the performance and have good taste"
Best halftime performance in many years!
why mumblerap a halftime show?
This was the best halftime show ever ong
I can see why TAEHYUN Loves him
"NOT A KENDRICK FAN, BUT HE ATE UP DRAKE SO BAD"
Watched every day since SB and going watch this every day as long as it takes
"Kendrick flowwww AHHHH unmatched. And SZA being a goddess, what a great halftime show."
"Worst recording ever made of a half time show. Is it impossible to edit the absolutely ridiculous audio to text? This is missing chunks of lyrics, and words like tiramisu should ve sufficiently common enough to be csptured accuately. Irs almost like you weren't invested... or don't care about this performance versus others you have posted on this very platform... at very very worst this was done on purpose. Honestly, if that's the case, I think any credibility you just tried to buy WITH this very performance is questionable. Dare I suggest you touch grass? Or is that too firward of me? Cheers!"
Back again
Forget Drake
"This is so laced, remember when the food stamp was teal and brown now the hundred is blue."
Im watching EVERYDAY ! #hookedonthemesssge #gamechangingingtalent #sooooogood

I KEEP COMING BACK TO WATCH. EPIC!!
I've never given 2 shits about a halftime show. But this is incredible.
How many time you gon watch this
This was literally hyped the whole time. Only drake fans and Republicans complained after Republicans wanted to cancel the NFL
We need a new world record set for Highest number of views by an individual of Kendrick Lamars halftime show
General consensus is - worst halftime show ever.
"I love the fact that people hate this performance so much. It's almost 100M views, not even in one month. You know what ? I will also hate this performance so much, so I will rewatch a couple of times. It's so hated, people want to rewatch it even more."
"83.98M VIEWS!!!!!!!! I saw that and was like, I have a free 14 minutes, guess Im back for the 20th time"
"This Mr. Kendall Lamar is not very good, I can't believe he won all those grammars"
Everyone that hates this is inept

1:18 FACE

You cant fake influence. Back here again
Honestly this is a masterpiece
2 two weeks 84 million let's get it to 150 million before march.
"Ohhh Maaaannn this is the madness that I fell in love with since childhood. This is a real break between the brain and the body. It is impossible to watch calmly, the whole body sways to the beat. From Uzbekistan Respect!!!!"
"Awesome, for those who paid attention, he just told the world whats been going on in Hollywood and the children crimes. Minute 10:00 and over"
9:58
"Love the choreography, the symbolism, his catalog, and the story behind it all. Its pure art. Makes you think. Love it!"
he sounds like he's trying to be snoop dogg
"10:53 ""Say, Drake.....!!!"""
People say This is the most viewed Superbowl of All Time. Like if you Agree!

"My name is Moo Deng. I made the meme. It was difficult to put the clips together, but unfortunately something went so wrong. Now i cant do anything but bite these stupid caretakers."
Hello again!
Game Over
I wonder how much Debbie Deb got for her sample
Kendrick has the cutest smile
Totally Amazing!!
This is the only halftime show I have ever watched and I've watched it multiple times :D Couldn't care less about anything that came before
Probably a minor!!!!!
calling him out on the super bowl floor is just insane.
Im also back this my 25th time
"how many times have you watched this , YES"
10:53
I wish more people talked about All the Stars. That song is so good and always reminds me of how awesome it was when black panther came out. Chadwick would have loved to see this.
0:10 anyone know whats the title of this song??
I cannot even explain how this performance has impacted my existence.
I was at a Super Bowl watch party and I thought this superbowl was really good but there were two individuals who kept doging on it saying its just noise or one kid said Well this certainly isnt Beethoven I was abouta throw hands with them
One of if not the worst halftime shows in history.... Whoever approved this needs to be fired.....
4:42 EUPHORIA

"After watching this video for the 30th time, I should know every dance move and song by heart."
"Bro got hundreds of thousands of people to go ""A minoooorrrr"" at one command"
"Biggie Smallz made it to the Super Bowl, this is classic"
Worst halftime show ever
"I feel that this gets better the more you watch it. Its kinda like arcane where on rewatch, theres a lotta details that stands out and the highs and hypes are sweeter and more enjoyable."
Black people are amazing!

7:04 I wanna perform they favorite song but you know they love to sue
10:52 youre welcome.
Shalawam Mashpacha! APTTMHY!
"Mana tu yang bilang performance nya underbudget buat superbowl, they don't know the real deal Mr. Lamar planning. Haters gonna be haters tho"
in 10 years i will still know who i was with and where i was when this show hit the tv
Crazy show tbh
10:50 what you all came for so you dont have to find it yourself
inject this whole show into my veins
"""Scorekeeper, deduct one life."" God tier."
yes. im here. again!!!
I have never watched the Super Bowl let alone the Halftime show until this one.
I don't care what people say. I already am an unhealthy amount watching this including all reactions
Drake dislike this video
I'm sure I've watched this an unhealthy amount of times.
Cant get over this
"This stuff has levels to it, trying to translate it from English isn't easy. Even defanged, Kendrick still has a bite."
Phenomenal performance! Truth!
How many times did you watch? Yes
"Imagine, 1/10 of profit goes towards the homeless problem we have in the USA !"
YEAHHHH
less go
Peak
Them Kendrick thighs
"The way Kendrick dog walked Drake on national TV is going to be legendary. And how it went worldwide. I'm going ""A MINOOOOOOOOORRRR"" all the way from Colombia"
The thing about it is this is on another level
I like that Kendrick used SZA real name Solana
Jajaja gracias por hacer un video TOPP
"Having Samuel L Jackson there with ""what America wants"" was dope"
Todos los das estoy aqu desde el da del sper bowl
"Dam, Americans cant say ambulance ahaa ambalamps ?"
This performance lives rent free in my head and I'm ok with it..
"This Drake, you nothing can come back from that.The whole world saw that bro"
"I am a crusty old punk who has never really listened to Mr. Lamar. I've seen this halftime show about 20 times and two documentaries about his rise to success. He is a true artist, and I am now a huge fan."
Amoooo
My dad watched the Super Bowl
KDot and Mustard is rolling with a new Mustard commercial Heinz
soy Argentino mas nacionalista que nosotros no hay pero debo admitir que esta bueno este show de entretiempo
Having the whole world screaming A Minnnooooooorrrrr is one of the deadliest things you could do to a person
im back
12:51 MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD!!!
This is the amount of petty I inspire to be.
"Drake beef aside, there isn't a better time to listen and understand his message than now !"
The amount of time I have watched this is really unhealthy.
would have rather had wayne on stage. Kendrick a weirdo.
"Sunday, February 23rd , 2025 - It's been two weeks since the Super Bowl, and I'm still watching and enjoying Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl Halftime Show. Can't get enough! It was too good!!!"
Bro didnt do 30 for 30!!!!
Bom demais
The entire crowd singing A Minor is CRAZY WORK
Kendrick Lamars He is the winner of this beef
"The fact that was performed on my bday,I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET THIS...PRICELESS"
0:53 why does this remind me of one of those clown cars
Hearts 4:52 4:52
Oh yeah Im still jamming this. I just get hype!! Ima STAR BABY..
Say drake that smile he gives
"Imagine your diss track being a part of the super bowl, from your op...good lord, that'll give you a half-black eye."
Not being American I think I need a lot of the lyrics translated or explained. Can someone put subtitles to this so people like me can understand the message.
I've been coming back to this video for 13 days now.
I am here again!! This performance is addictive!!!!
12:24 hi
"Sou f nmero um desse cara, duque de caxias RJ Brasil!!"
GO BIRDS!
This will be 100 million before march!!
I don't even like football and I'm sad I missed this live lmao
Brilliant used a popular song to drop a whole album on yall he feeds music for your soul AND MIND!!!
DIOS ES BUENO!! BUEN SHOW!
"I know Im not tripping. But when this was live on Super Bowl Sunday,wasnt there a section of people holding lights spelling T.V. Off at the end of Kendricks performance"
What's the dance at 6:23 I saw some football players doing it when they scored
"I wasn't very familiar with Kendrick Lamar, but this performance was awesome. I'm also so impressed with all of the symbolism; my English class literally spent 90 minutes analyzing this 13 and a half minute performance."
I watch this daily along with my kendrick mix

8:18
Yo! Latina amando estoooooo todooooo
The say drake I hear you like Im youngwas personal
Im back
"The fact that drake is associated here is crazy. This is about any given person, any given time."
There's millions of people sleeping inthe streets and this people are wasting their money listening this clowns so that the NFL continues with their brainwashed machines and making billions of dollars from sport fanatics .
yawn
This is too ghetto. Need a shower and a toothbrush now
American GD
Flawless and epic in every way; everyone involved was just incredible. I keep coming rewatching it and love it every time.
10:53 Drake Together a slight smile
I keep watching this like a Music Video
Revolutionary remind me of NWA
The best ever
Man is a genius. How can anyone help but to appreciate how much thought he put into this show. It's a perfect example of art.
Longest beef ever
I'm back again & it's gained 10mil views in a few days by this point I need counseling Kendrick the greatest of all time
Word!!
W4e4
SQUABBLE UP
Reasons why I'm here: 1. the kdot angels 2. Kendrick Lamar
"I'm not a big rap fan, and I don't hate Drake (only indifferent), but for some reason I can't stop watching this... The flow, the choreography, the message, everything is AAA+"
Thank you Drake for making this happen.
"I know rap music isnt for everyone, but how can anyone say this show was boring?! Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam was gold! I also love how all the dancers were coordinated and in sync in their choreography and colors, and that they were clearly symbolizing something. You can tell there was a lot of planning and thought put behind this show and I appreciate that, Kendrick didnt have to do that, but he did. I still havent figured out all the hidden meanings behind this performance yet, theres a lot to dissect. I dont listen to Kendrick Lamar a lot, but I love SZA and her singing was my favorite part! I also love her outfit."
71% of the views are by me lol
This is my 30th or 40th time watching this and about to watch it again
Ou sont les malien
legendary performance
yeaaa im back again to watch this!
What song! That song..
https://youtu.be/Ponr8Uld58E footage of drake crying?!!
hei US. Do you what a masterpiece this is? Probably not.. because you are busy with dissing everyone who is different to you
How u diss a dude at superbowl
ITS THE EDITED CROWD SOUNDS FOR ME. BRAHHH.
10:53 DANG BRO GET ME SMILEING TOO
"This is a historical moment, Kendrick has opened the eyes of a complacent blinded society on one of the largest televised platforms in just 15 minutes. This is bigger than the music, this a revolution bringing power to the people they not for us and THEY NOT LIKE US!"
.. GOAT
Say drake
Fire
"Did they play ads during this? If yes, Id be pissed as hell lmao"
Yall say what you want about Jay Z but he blackified the half time show and ninjas acting like it just happened and dont wanna give him no credit
The little details makes this 10x better
10:00
You're saying I gotta buy tickets to some ball game to go to this show?
Why do I watch this at least twice a day? Lord give me strength! This is just a masterpiece! And the GNX album is chefs kiss!
Incredible.
These ads are pissing me off
This is bigger than the music
The smile is priceless
Why this break last 2hr
How is this getting better the more I watch!
They walk around like tease
Take 10 back again
I love him he called out the government so well in this
I enjoyed it. Took me a while to watch the show but I finally did and I really enjoyed it. Especially the end the smile says I did that
The whole Super Bowl stadium singing its PROBALY A MINOR may be the greatest thing to ever be done in a diss track. Drake for sure cried himself to sleep. This is insanity.
This halftime show is sick!!
Ive noticed since his Mr. Moral concert that Kendrick has only like 3 or 4 dance moves he does on repeat. Lol hilarious.
Lord this is it. We waited for this
Perfect soundtrack for.not the superbowl halftime show.
If this comment goes viral
Oh I came late
I saw that inverted triangle. I SEE YOU. The symbolism in this in INCREDIBLE. Say it LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. Kendrick wake em up!!!!! This performance is a Masterpiece
Sooo good
"Somewhere in the multiverse, Ja Rule and Pappa Doc are sighing relief that they are no longer the most cooked in a rap battle."
7:02
Best halftime show of all time
MUSTARDDDDDDDDDDA
Prefiero otras super bowls pero bueno no est mal tampoco
This is the GOAT
If you wanna make a political statement. It helps to not make it unintelligible noises.
My Daily Dose of DOT
Does anyone remember when the Super Bowl was football game
"43 time! I know, Im about to find something to do!i love the revolution though!"
Drakes gonna sue the super bowl.
Me to back again
He is too strong
Sorry nfl I spelled wrong its NFL not nfl
Hi
He 100% beat Drake
"Kendrick Lamar sent a message to the music business: Don't bring another Aubrey up in here, another industry plant, and try to gentrify Rap and Hip Hop and make it more palatable for society to digest, because if you do, we will DESTROY HIM!!! Rap & Hip Hop is BLACK CULTURE!!!"
"I'm from Brazil... since i was kid i really liked e and love about United States culture... Flash Back videoclips, some singers performance, I began to learn English with 2013 years old at Duolingo, and my interesting started by singers influence... and untill these currently days... i've never been seeing on amazing performance like these one... I watch this performance every day..."
Ight back here for the 100000000000000000 time
Now I can't even listen to the full song on Spotify. I always stop after the 1st verse because of this performance
Watch Drake be the halftime performer next year Still won't touch this.

Drake when he sings the diss
"Drake got cooked, he watches kendrick get 5 Grammys for not like us and then gets dissed in front of 250 million people live"
It gets better everytime you watch it
iconic
"Anybody notice the girl who covered her crotch at 10:55 during the Drake diss track? I might be reading too much into it. But, if it was a strategic move, that man is diabolical!"

+1M aura
"The white liberals, who have been posing as our friends, have failed us. The white liberal is the worst enemy to America and the worst enemy to the black man. White liberals are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the black man as our friend to get our sympathy, our allegiance and our minds. The white liberal attempts to use us politically against white conservatives, so that anything the black man does is never for his own good, never for his advancement, never for his own progress, hes only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal. I only cite these things to show you that in America the history of white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make us think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white liberal. The only way that our problems will be solved is when the black man wakes up, cleans himself up, stands on his own two feet, stops begging the white liberal and takes immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white liberal to do for us. The medias the most powerful entity on Earth. They have the power to make the innocent look guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and thats power. Because they control the mind of the masses. The Democrats are playing you for a political chump and if you vote for them, not only are you a chump, you are a traitor to your race. Malcolm-X."
Luther 7:25 also Il show and example but have yall noticed sza always goes lower or crouchs because it makes Kendrick look tiny if she standed normally heres and example 8:15
K dot don't miss
YOOOO WOWWWW!!! This is LEGENDARY!! At the halftime show of all places???? Daaaaannnngggg somebody had to do it!!
All I heard was folks ain't like the halftime show I can't tell
This is the best halftime show ever
83M and counting ........
the amount of times ive watched this is ridiculous
I love him. Yep. Chills
Okay but so curious what the audience sees. Is there screens where they see what we see in this video or do they only see from the sidelines??
This is the best halftime show
"Everyone in that show was next level stars, not average on anyone's list They were GOATS on their own, but they formed this alliance and made American history. Kendrick is a genius. All this symbolism-this is more significant that we will still be talking about this performance 20 years from now. Kendrick Lamar, Samuel L. Jackson, Serena Williams, Sza, and Mustard, Well done clan, well done. There will never be a superbowl performance like this in our lifetime. Remember, this moment in time, it will help to sustain us during the darkest moments in US history. The return of antidemocracy. Remember this performance. It might be our last glimpse of free speech as we know it."
his smile while drake part XDD
Genius performance!!!!
Is this called Music?
music isnt political .
This has got to be the greatest half-time performance of all time! I was GLUED to the screen with a smile the entire time. Lol
Palestine
Halftime show is top 3 all time

"@Me7-e8o Same, I've watched this several times already"
"Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!"
O cara Fod4 mermo
Rewatching this after watching Josh Johnson's breakdown of it put the whole thing in a new light. Miles away from the typical ADHD fueled montages that most halftime shows are. This is art with a message.
Sellout
Now I'm understand why so many people said he is top 5 goat.
How do people not get how epic this was
Two weeks later.. And Im back again
Watching 4th time for no reason
Im here for the Say Drake and SZA and Serena

Best performance Ever
The fact bro also paid a debut to Xxxtentacion is so
7:00 is epic
Your DNA comes from the greatest people on this earth!!!!
SZA can sing disrespect to someone and sound so beautiful. Yea Kendrick made it world wide off that distrack. The Super Bowl got more then their money worth out of this constant performance. His dancers got breaks.
@6:28 Peekaboo!

"Can we please bring back normal music for the Superbowl halftime performances, please?"
"Champagne though he was going to get away with it but, KD says not on my time"
Hey Drake

Kendrick is a legend
Absolutely hooked on this. I get goosebumps EVERY TIME I watch it.
The besssssssssssy kdot is a goat!
SLAY KENDRICK YOU KEEP UP WITH YOUR AMAZING TALENT also THANKYOU FOR BRING SZA

I'm back....... happy Sunday
"I don't care if someone said that this was worst superbowl halftime show. But as non american guy, this man brought me to this kind of event, and it was fantastic show."
"Still watching, cant get enough"

6:10
Sam Emmy has been on a mission to music
4:51 he literally said the nword
02/23/2025 just leaving my comment on this legendary performance so I can show my kids in the future. Rewatching for the 10th time!
"Confession time: Before this, I hadn't listened to a single song by Kendrick Lamar, but there was so much hype around this halftime show that I decided to give it a try. I'm SO glad I did! I've watched it at least 50 times and have gone through Kendrick's entire discography. What a showstopping performance from an incredibly talented and clever artist! He's made a fan out of me for life!"
It's best when kendrick is including mustard all the time.
A minor!
"Just did an entire week dedicated to KDOT, and leaned a lot about this Man and what his messages are. I actually have about 4 hours spread out over multiple videos going over this performance. And im gonna keep going, lots to discover and analyze so i can understand everything about all his messages."
Mid
No way nfl dissing drake
"Help, I can't stop watching this!!! I don't typically listen to this genre of music but I have so much respect for the artistry, the choreography, and the skills of every person on stage. I feel sorry for those who can't appreciate it, but I can't imagine a more perfect halftime show."
Play it again!
Respect to kendrick for letting some teams play
Samuel you did the shi go dude (im a huge fan )
11:54
Id say the rivalry is over and someone just got buried...
Heading to onehundread Billion veiws
10:53 he smiles into the camra lol
I've watched this probably 20 times. Life changing...
Epic!!!!!!
King Kendrick
Lamaaaarrrrr how are youu maaan?
Nice acting Kendrick
Cad os br ?
"Humilde fue parte de otra pelcula de ""super o anti hroes""?"
insane choreography
Say Drake.
This wasnt a performance this was ART .
Everyone brought their A-game from Kendrick to the stage hands this is historic
My children keep requesting this video. Theyre 4 years old.
Yeahh ima be watching this for the next 20 years @NFL PLEASE NEVER TAKE THIS DOWN
He did it
All the songs sound exactly the same.
Back again
... ...
This is unprecedented wow the superbowl show for reply this is a first
Winner takes that smile
I don't know how many times I done came back and the more I watch it I love it
this entire time i thought the lyric was really dethrone him not bully death row lmfaoooo
This is fire
You gonna get flare jeans ?
I know im the only one but I think he is overrated. Ok enough negativity for today
Back Again
It was very interesting
Aaaaaand I'm back
here we go again
Love how he doesnt use many vocal effects so what you hear on a song is what youll hear in person.
Lmao people actually thought this halftime was wack but 80 mill views says otherwise
Too black imo. Boy have times changed for the worst.
I didn't approve of those jeans ...his stylist should be fired....
KL
10:05
One of the best halftime shows ever
I don't know how many times I watched this
Im watching it again
MUSSSSSTAAAAARRRRDDDDD!!!!
I here you like em young got me speachless
Miiiiiiiiiddd
Best halftime show in awhile
The way they performed is lit lol kendrick lamar
Got DRAKE EXs on Stage
"Seriously, I watched this as people said it shouldnt be missed this was barely musical."
At 10:53 bro he was waiting to do that smile
"13 days later, and Im STILL coming back to this video!"
"I wonder what percentage of these views/comments are actual people, and not bots. Id guess less than 50%"
Am
"The fans looks bored. The MJ, brunomars, beyonce halftime show is still the best"
This was a protest. I think the NFL might be with us.
Drake turned his tv off
"Guys, please show love for this guy hard work and excellence, please share this show video with friends and family, help dot to reach 100Million"
I can watch this 100 times!
This is my favorite movie
Glad he gave mustard his own entrance
This isn't a Super Bowl Halftime Show...... This is a Kendrick Lamar musical piece Sponsored by the NFL & Apple Music. Can the NFL actually win a Grammy behind this????
"Kendick, go my man. Reach 100M"
King Kendrick
"Kendick, go my man. Reach 100M"
"Im back for like the 1,000th time! This is one of the best performances I ever seen."

Wack
I thought the halftime show was kinda boring
Boy I'm back here again for the 20th time!!!
Samuel L is a AMAZING. I LOVE HIM
SZA has the most melodious and beautiful voice I have heard from new singers in the last decade. Her voice is like a smooth summer breeze.
10:00 starts
"Im trying real hard to enjoy this kind of song, but I cant. Im sorry."
8:28 WHEN DHE WAS SBOUT TO SAY SOUL A FREAKING ADD POPPED UP
11:54 MUSTARDDDDDD
"Now, I'm wondering if Drake wants to take back his taunting of wanting Kendrick to drop, drop, drop, drop. Kendrick dropped kicked Drake into another dimension that he can't even find his way back."
The dancers were amaaaazing
Que pena que esto solo haya resaltado por la controversia
10:17 and 11:33 is what you came for thank me later
What Have music?
Sugar Sheed Nation Lets Goooo
Of course Youtube would not do ads just at the beginning and at end of the most epic half time show ever they just had to throw them at every damm moment ruining my Kendrick vibe
Quem bolou esse show e a coreografia so genios
"As a white guy it was great to see black people put on a show, fitting of Broadway. Great job."
Im back again.
Dont know how many times Ive rewatched this
Im here..back again
im back
Best vid
This is the best song he ever did
My brother said i must put a comment saying Hes the goat
"The game over on the seats, Serena, Samuel L Jackson, the smile when he says Drake, the rizz, just top level entertainment"
10:51
10:20 thank me later
That was insane... 82M Views already... and he didn't use Fruity Views like drake said trust me
Masterpiece
I was trying to see all the hype about this since I've been seeing all these little videos. 30 seconds into his performance I realized I can't sit through the whole thing and I actually like KL. Hopefully next year they give a different genre a chance. The last halftime shows have been about the same. Time to do something for the rest of the people.
THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!! THATS WHY HES MVP!!!! THATS WHY HES THE GOOOATT THE GOAAAAT
The rap at the start is amazing
"This is truly a masterclass. I'm obsessed at this point. Anyone else asking some nights ""why am I still up?"""
szaaaaa
fire
"82M views for supposedly ""the worst"" Halftime show"
~~~~~~~
guh
turn the TV Off Sam!!
daily reminder to watch this so i can scream mustard at 2 in the morning
Peekaboo and Euphoria

"Might get found dangling from an oak tree, if e get caught down ya, cause he aint like us"
LOVED THIS TOO MUCH HE'S A TRUE ARTIST!!!
freaking good stage I've ever seen in this world
I already watched to this 100 times
Anyone here today?
Anyone here today?
"I missed the superbowl. &, most of what I saw was this hate about his show. I thought, oh ok, maybe its cuz rap is harder to showcase on live tv to those at home. This performance was top notch & clearly filled with messages people need to hear if they stop to listen. Haters dont get it, cuz they didnt take time to get it. So used to thinking things have to be done a certain way & missing the artistry when a different plate is served. Kudos performance KL!"
melhor coisa que vi nesta plataforma at hoje
Day 13. I just found a mistake
Grando sem medo
Best of all time
They dont like us
Best nfl performance forever even better than dc dre

i will do nothing for every like this comment gets.

Kendrick looks so innocent buh so devious omg
Back again yall. Let run it up.
The fact they didnt even add proper captions.
10:17
SESNSATIONAL
Boring
I think I need help. I can't stop.
Real question: was SZA really singing live? Bc that sounded impeccable.
"11:47 ""I GO BY THE NAME OF..."""
"Can't wait for 100million views for a show people ""hated""."
Boring
10:08
"BACKSTREET FREESTYLE KENDRICK SAYS ""MARTIN HAD A DREAM, KENDRICK HAS A DREAM. AND HIS DREAM WAS TO EXPOSE AUBREY AS A WEINSTIEN DIDDY CLONE WITH ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS EVER CREATED IN HUMAN HISTORY"
"10:53 looking at his face, he was mean that rip Drake"

DRAKE
Never re-watched a Superbowl half-time show this many times.
Idk why im here again

This isnt about Drake he made a statement by silent protesting about the injustice of America. Uncle Sam was used as a form of America pride for the military because Kendrick is smarter than what he shows

"A big shout out to Choreographer Charm La'Donna, the Cinematographer (couldn't find the Cinematographer name), Art Director Shelley Rodgers and her crew at Tribe Inc., which was founded by her husband, production designer Bruce Rodgers), They ALL deserve"
That woman has an angelic voice
R.I.P. Drake

Anyone 2025 feb 23 here
I have so respect for the dancers
"This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"
Yes . I cant get enough of
"Dear """"@tieight-f5y ""You people need to think more critically."" """" Not only did Kendrick Win 5 Grammy Awards, and the Halftime slot, he also broke the record of most half-time viewers over both Usher and Michael Jackson. Also, here's something else to critically think about: More people viewed his half-time performance than those who viewed the suprbowl itself. Which means that not only did he break records, but he also increased the amount of viewers for the game, apparently."
3:15 what about the people behind him. they cant see him properly lol
I am here once more. This was just the perfect performance...the dancers made the whole story telling compelete.
"resume read like the greatest accomplishments in the history of the genre as a whole: a Pulitzer, 22 Grammys & 2 Super Bowl performances! I mean stop it"

Haba mejores candidatos y eligen lo ms aburrido
Aubrey is crashing out! He's destroying so many relationships and burning bridges. He's doing more damage to his career than the beef did! Whew! This is tragic! What a downfall!
Why old Jackson alwys Interuping the song
Musterd on the beat
The DETAILS
Buick GNX!
I just watched this performance for the first time. It was amazing! Im glad I watched an explanation before seeing it. It sent chills down my spine. Now THAT was a statement!
"I hope when kids are taught about this point in history, their teachers show them this"
Drake got cooked with this one its just game over
How can anyone hate on this performance? This is fire!
This time Gods choosing US. Nothing but the truth!
10:53 the way he looked straight at the camera after avoiding it is crazy
10:00
It got televised
"Say drake, I hate you like I'm young"
Only a racist gets mad over liking this w/o being BLACK.
Hold on
"Wish I could like this 1,000,000 times!!"
"Stop, he's already dead!"
Im following the transcript and still have no idea what 90% of this means Am I just dumb? Or is this by design?
This is just not music
12:00 is wholesome!
"God is watching, and Kendrick his child SPITUAL"
"The energy only circulate through us, 0:37"
so good!
.here we are again
coming back to see this epic performance && sickkk choreography & reading everyone else creeping back in here is everything
"This stuck with me, and I came back to watch it again. Thats always how I find my new favorite things!"
I've watched this an unhealthy amount of times
I bet drizzy turned his tv off 1000s of times since the drop
Drake wish he could do this
I was expecting tyler preforming that guy with kdot
Anyone know the names of all the songs(except humble and not like us)
"To those who said they didn't know who kendrick was, they sure as hell know who he is now. The man has gone viral with an almost year old record, making it back into the. spotlight. kDot."
100 million views coming soon
The Dancers didn't seem like they tried to one up each other. Teamwork! Unity ftw!
Do you call it song ?
One of the best performances ever!
"This is going to be one of the halftime shows of all time. It's hard to follow up Prince's, ""can you make it rain harder"" and his performance, but this is a statement performance, and I hope the NFL keeps this energy moving forward."
"At this point, Ive watched this so many times Ive lost count and Im just seeing that those guys have been sitting, at the top of the light post the entire performance"
10:52 Say Drake
This was FYE!!!!
"You KNOW drake was sitting watching his tv, arms crossed, face red with steam coming out of his ears"
Samuel dont play that
Kendrick violated drakes career
sza brought me here
"Im on number 43! I may need rehab! Its been the background of my life, since its hit YT!"
Holler
I thought last 3 minutes were epic
Back again

Kendrick is a GEMINI. Thats why! Cry little Scorpio (Drake). You can mess with everyone but not with a GEMINI. Watch and learn how its done
"as if a Blk GN wasn't ALREADY HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER. <3 iT! the car community is gon H8 KDOT 4 this driving up the price on white folks FAV car, LOL"
11:20 is the best
This was honestly so fun to watch
"But when God shows up he shows out, Kendrick is a child of God, Amen"
Got me shaking up the indie house at 12 am vibing to this #iheatsza

"D. R. A. K. E. Stands for "" DON'T RAP AGAINST KENDRICK EVER """
Love KDot but still the most cringe ihes ever been

Uncle Samsonite?

Impressive
This beef ended in the Super Bowl. Kdot the champ talk about crip walking over someones grave lol
"This is only my 56,865th time here."
Whats funny is I watched this with a bunch of old boomers and they spent the whole time complaining about how they didnt get it but the one thing that united them was the grand national lmao they loved that car
Sza gotta be top 10 of the most beautiful girls in the world
"12 days later, I still comeback to this video several times a day"

And were back again
https://youtube.com/shorts/X5MLRcOm4a8?feature=share
Almost 2 weeks later and I'm still watching this and have the same feelings as when I first watched it much love
I see the Bay Area all in this!
"Only the not like us part was good and they only played like 10% of it Also not a single White person. Or Mexican. Or Native. Or Asian. Ergo, disliked"
Guys a goof
Its a shame how the people are trying to make a s which stands for sza 7:25
I love this entire performance but my favorite part is when they start performing Peekaboo 6:09 the choreo is hella cali and that part just goes so hard.
Back again guys
boring halftime show
This started taribly
But where is Drakeeeeee
"Get it Kendrick, compton in the building"
Back again
"Drake, how did you come for COMPTON LMAO"
That one lady has a beautiful voice though. The lady in red.
I cant stop coming back
Sza ate
Say Drake
"Im trying to tell you at the super bowl party i said Kendrick Lamar bout to show our, and i love you Kendrick"
Oh those jeans tho
Professor Lamar has spoken!!!
"I can't. I tried. I wanted to like it, but this is awful."
Mamat alkatiri
Ooo k dot was outta breath when he said california eee yikes. Still dope
7:12 danngggg
Who came back to watch this epic performance again?
"""Once a lame.Always a lame."" Kendrick Lamar"
Kendrick got people who couldn't care less about the Superbowl looping his performance on repeat the icon he is
I watch this in school
Game Over.
kdot did it
Lethal. Whats each sing he recited? Noobie here
SZA COME OUT AND I LITERALLY CRYING!
"THE BEST EVER, HANDS DOWN, EPIC, ENERGETIC,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Best half time ever
"Im so distanced from this is unbelievable hahaha. I have no idea about any these issues or grievances that is perceived by artists or communities that got some kind of message. Im still trying to figure out if its sad that I dont know about this or that its sad youre perceiving a fight against a population that most likely doesnt see it in the same way. Like your fighting against someone who doesnt exist or the someone who has no idea they upsetting this other person. Its some nebulous fight that Im an outside observer of yet live in the same society. Oh well guess Ill go back into my YouTube rabbit hole hahaha. By the way, keep up the good fight."
Hip-hop > Country
I'm ready to join that revolution
9:47Thats what were all here for
my grandma was dancin during this dude. caught her also singing some of dna this morning too
I'm back watching again
"11:09 say drake, I heard you like em young"
Im going to tell my grandkids about seeing this live ngl
This performance SUCKED as a SUPER BOWL HALFTIME -- just look at the reactions of MOST people watching it. It was only good when the girl singing in Luther sang. These half time shows belong to the singers. It only ever worked when Snoop and Dre using CLASSIC songs played. Not these. -Drake
os gangters verdadeiros no fazem coreografias .
You See how cringe are usa is what is this. American Culture is so uglx
"Ahh, this is going to be nice to come back to!"
"Next album gonna use that craassshsample alot i bet, might even be the project name."
Love it
This mafaka couldnt wait for this
I'll be here is 2045 I promise
Kendrick really put on one of the best super bowls ever it was a message
Someone should tell Roger to give the Super Bowl trophy to KDot
81 million views on a person's funeral crazy
Who noticed the squid game vibes from the choreography
This is the only halftime show I have ever watched multiple times
0:50 This shot goes HARD
7:00 yes dot? AHH MY FAVORITE PARTTT!
I will say it again. He is GENIUS
O:
82 million views
I'm just back here for this masterpiece
Cantinflas
Like 10th time watching already gotta love it
the best super bowl half time thanks Kendrick Lamar's.
"I've been seeing a lot of white folks complaining that this halftime show was the ""worst ever"". I didn't watch it live (I'm one of the few Americans who is not invested in the Super Bowl and so don't watch it.) So I made the effort to come watch it here, and here are my thoughts. In general, Im not a huge rap fan, but that is because it isnt a part of my cultural memory and doesnt hold much meaning for me. It doesnt speak to me the way Bach or Brahms does. But I can still respect it for the art form it is. One shouldnt reject something just because it is unfamiliar. (And the choreography was awesome!)"
Sexy
Everyone go watch Josh Johnson break down this show
Let's get this incredible and powerful Superbowl halftime performance to a 100 Million views!
"Remember Kendall Lamar has won several grammars and they had usher, they had The Weeknd, they had Beyonc, they had real performers and this was the worst half time and the music itself isnt broad enough or well known enough and this was a nightmare."
This Super Bowl performance gets better the more times you re-watch it
Greatest halftime show I ever witnessed. I randomly get urges to watch this whole thing again
00:08 name of this bgm ??
Thats so wild
"Every single day!!! I am helpless, I swear! I'm ready for ""Behind the Scenes, or maybe "" The Making Of....."" on a streaming channel near you."
we the people.....best halftime show EVER
11:29 NOT DRAKES EX
Im back for the 3rd time
"worst halftime show in the history of football. ""What America wants""??? hell no!!!"
Round 107. Loop it again ty
I am OBSESSED with this halftime show!!
ts so cringe
And my little brother said a minoooooooooor
This was just to dig Drake up only to bury him again when the final nail in the coffin hes never coming back.
Dopest show every
Even the football players was dancing and crunk with Kendrick Lamar
12:00 fine asf and he look like Roddy rich
how many dancers fitted on that gnx
I know NFL and Jay-Z are poking their chests out now
been watching daily
10:53 - Coming back yet again.
"Hahaha, i bet drake said this dude did not have to come this hard, yes drake COMPTON COMES HARD, you tryed the wrong one boooo["
I cant wait for the concert this summer
Kendrick smiled and said WHATTTT
10:53 say Drake
"Let me say this, im a female and i would never run up or challenge Compton, so Kendrick tell em , he ain't locked in yet...LMAO"
"Very clean rap, bass, vocal, lyrics focus. Rip repeat button"
"God is so good Kendrick baby, keep holy spirit hands on your heart baby"
Playing a diss track at the super bowl is some Eminem type stuff
"We locked in Kendrick Lamar, I've loved Kendrick sense he first came out, SMILING POOL AND LIQUOR AND WE DIVE IN ,yes Kendrick"
Is it js me or this is my I think my 10th time watching this
10:01 yesssssssssss MUSTEREDDDDD ON THE BEAT!!!!!!!YESSSSSS
"When i tell you Kendrick Lamar best super bowl performance ever, and Serena with the best female crip walk YOU GO GIRL"
2.8 Million of us stand up
omg
6:58 I already know Luther
Absolute history.
Great performance but I still think lil Wayne would of had the superdome shaking
"Kendrick's Gemini twin is back, in America. Wayne will just test him something, but bro knows the truth. Kendrick listens to Himself alone. He ain't being narcissistic, he just being progressive"
Performing a Diss track at Super Bowl half time is insane
Ive watched this superbowl performance so many times I lost count my fave !!
This might be the peak of the west coast and peak of everything in hip hop who will beat this mans records he set!! Sheeeshh
Im back !
Drake dislike this
"This is amazing! I don't know if you guys agree, but this reminds me of Rage against the machines when they played ''Sleep now in the fire'' disrupting Wall Street. America and the world needed another revolutionary moment like that. Anyway, I watched this at least 10 times. Congratulations to Mr. Lamar! GOAT! He deserves all the praise and success that comes his way. Peace and love from Serbia! <3"
SZA in the house
SZA is slaying
Uncle sam idea is brilliant
I wonder how Kendrick is feeling know WE still love watching EVERY day...Fire...period!!!!
I don't care what anyone says there's no way LIL Wayne could have done better than this.
The way sza bounces at 8:14
Why he look feminine he dl for sure
Gil Scott Heron reference
all the stars was magical
"Kendrick said he trying to see Compton, come on Kendrick repasent now baby"
"Headshots for the year. You better walk around like Daft Punk......he really meant that sh*t, lol"
"Come on with MUSTARD ON THE BEATS, Kendrick Lamar got off"
10:13
Hands down flawless victory!
MUSTTTAAAAARAAARRRRRRRDDDDD
The smile was deviace
The best visuals in Superbowl history
I'm so PROUD of this young man!!!
Almost 82m views bro whats next eminem vs Kendrick Lamar?
12:33-12:37 was giving Eminem swag. I love everything about this performance. I cant stop watching! MUSTARRRRRRRRRRRRD!!!!!
"I've been watching it everyday since super bowl! The performance hits a different string in my heart every single time! K-dot has transcended it to another level (too high for certain haters obviously lol). And kudos to NFL and Roger, got me another reason to love this game and organization."
I love it. I'll be back again........and again.
Stuck in my head since super bowl..... He rocked those Celine. Jeans.... .. no really.... . Lol
Cleanest diss song
The genius and humility and love applied to the color palette... Kendrick! And Mister Samuel L Jackson is one of the hardest super bowl flexes since Michael Jackson! Like do people know where Samuel L Jackson started life to conqueror the heights of success and cool that we honor in him today? This was a dope half-time show!
"You might've thought the Chiefs were the biggest loser on this night, but the real loser here was Drake and it's not close. There are more people in the world that have heard Drake likes 'em young than knew who he was before the Super Bowl."
Bigger than the music.
Crowd was quiet because they wanted to hear greatness. Ive been to a Kendrick concert and its awesome
Best I ever seen
11:45
This is my 9th time and it's still so gooooood!
"Say Drake, ."
Compton straight in the house they not like us...
"Lol, its been only two weeks and Kendrick has almost 3X more views in his SB performance than Usher had in a year."
"Kendrick Lamar showed up and showed OUTTTT,I LOVE IT"
I can't get enough of this.
The good thing is drake already got the but his career is threw kendrick sealed the deal
And this man just had fun with his opportunity
Same
I will quote thats a 30 min greatness censored.. uncensored Kendrick lamar is phenomenal
No matter what. Kendrick showed he is superior. He will do it
Awwww Nawwwww
0:45
Classic button
9:57 not like usssss
Turn this tb off
Legit.... so much bigger then the stage.... watched it maybe 400 times but I did listen listen it like an addict even before the grammys
10:53 uhm you were just avoiding us now ur giving a death stare IM SCURRED
Dreams do come true!
Kendrick: I am performing in the Super Bowl Halftime not you Sza: ima do my own thing
NGL the best Super Bowl ever
The best moment of 2025
"10:50 ""say drake "" that was too funny"
The first non-marching band halftime show I've repeatedly watched. It was perfect. New bar set.
The x and the two exes =xxxtentation
One reason I keep popping back is to just watch this progress up in views!
Cant believe they allowed a live massacre on tv like that lol rip Drake lol
Drake is NOT showing his face ever again. Bro should just retire
GOAT
Yeshua's New Weapon
This ages really well
Pisa medonha foi essa
Anyone else notice the stages look like playstation buttons
Dont mind me probably just my 100th time here
Drake is dead
Mustard
I go by the name KDOT DOT Kendrick Lamar Mr Morale This is GNX
When will I stop replaying this
"This show was top-notch. Not only what he did, how he did it, but all the dancers, cameramen etc. One of the best productions I've seen"
AND STILL COMING BACK FOR MORE... Growing
What was in the X and he said peak a boo and he got drakes 2 X so xxxtiontion
Crazy
"Great performance, except for the part of him standing on a Grand National GNX"
My 100th times here cant qet over Kendrick naild that staqe
"The bullet points on Kendrick resume read like the greatest accomplishments in the history of the genre as a whole: a Pulitzer, 22 Grammys & 2 Super Bowl performances! I mean stop it"
Kendrick must praise drake fi buss him back
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:53 that smile
We need this full song
Pov Yt: Perfect soundtrack for...
10:06
I was there at the crowd

I love my kinfolk people we are the best in this thing of ours!.
Yall should have squabbled up. Too late now. I don't care anymore. 63 years old black woman. Yall can have this one. Love this performance. Truly golden.
BEST HALF TIME SHOW EVER!!!! ALL THE HATERS CAN ADMIT THEY have a PROBLEM WITH COLOR. ALSO NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR SICK COUNTRY MUSIC. ABOVE IS REAL AMERICAN MUSIC!!!!!
I cant stop watching this videoI think this is my 10th time here again. Lamar definitely put on an amazing show! They made a great choice picking him for the Super Bowl.
YESSSSSS I'M STILL WATCHING THIS...WOW
WORD!! I cant get enough!!!!
10:02 marking for myself
and Im back watching it again.
"Is he wearing womens, boot cut jeans?"
fiesta y funeral para Drake
"I love how SLJ is low key roasting Kendrick the whole time, but it all feels in good humor"
A masterclass in rap activism on a World Stage !!!
"So bullying and defaming others on a national stage is ok?? Take your opponent to court or solve it privately, simple!! Definitely blacks are not like us!"
11:58 palestin/sudan flag
Isaac
Luther was incredible
Was that MC Lyte who did the introduction? What's up from Flatbush and the 90's- MC Lyte... We miss you in these parts
Chris Brown next please please

11:59 you can see the protesters
Im back!
HISTORY MADEEEEREEEEEE
Mustaaaard
Desert this bih like tiramisu
Back again to relive PEAK!!!
To me the best part was S.L.Jackson
Serena crip walking to throw hate at Drake as a married woman? lmao how fuggin stupid
20 Day's Later
"I enjoy this performance because there wasnt nudity involved its refreshing to be able to watch this with my kids without having them to look away, Im old school and my parents didnt like me watching inappropriate things for my age and thats how I feel for my kids and this was a great show"
im still here.....
What was the first song he played when the people jumped out the clown car
When Kendrick started they not like us when I say everyone went wild it was crazy you got people screaming laughing I js can't imagine what Drakes thinking
This is mind-blowing and inspirational on so many levels.... 1) Kendrick's performance ability 2) the whole production team on point 3) the catchy beats 4) the complex lyrics 5) the metaphors and symbols everywhere 6) the public's reaction 7) Drake finally getting global humiliation for the imposter creep that he is... Congrats and thank you to everyone involved. This is beyond entertainment. This is beyond art.
12th day since I have had this as my meal
Are people forgetting that kendrick did two superbowls!!??? And murdered both of them!!!!!
Where is uncle Sams supersuit?
Muuuuuuustaaaaaard
Better than j.Lo
Everything in this show it's unforgettable
No one is talking about performance and camera angles during the peaka boo performance the way Kendrick pops up during the 1 st line is GENIUS Drake must shitting is pants . The boogie man is here for real
Felt so lucky to view such a cool half time show. Hope drake sorts his weird habits out and gets the help he needs. We're all human and all need help once or twice in our life's.
"This was the most watched Superbowl halftime show ever. However, it would've gotten even higher ratings if Lil Wayne performed instead of Kendrick. Wayne has sold considerably more records than K-dot."
what a joke
Im back again
Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks this is whack
"No, but why is Kendricks performance of not like us so much better than the original song?!?!"
I'm surprised I like the show....
aight Im here for the 10th time
I never loved Kendrick. But my son always loved this example of diss tracks. The one that got 5 Grammy awards. And that decision? The results are expected to be opposing.
That score keeper deduct a life is crazy with peekaboo
This about my 3rd or 4th time coming to watch again within 2 weeks . It would have been more if I wasn't working or handling business
drake ta todo cagado kk
81 million views
"Were working on Kendricks message of unity, boycotting everything but local business, on the 28th! Lets get it!"
Esta es la 5ta vez
Kendrick Lamar and Eminem are easily two of the most overrated rappers of all-time.
Why are so many of the best performers ever short ah?
Back watching again
5:30 what song?
"When you know the American Superbowl show is just luck of choreography and getting worse, most of what those dancers do is run and walk around like some children in the park , no wonder Asian singers are better on the stage performance like BTS members, Blackpink members and many more!!!"
Drake definitely turned his TV off
"Kendrick Lamar, Lamar for a reason"
pourquoi y a que des noirs
back again again 2 weeks later
"Best performances in d superbowl history no cap. No back music, breath control is something else... K. Dot u d man. Av watch it more Dan 10x nd still counting"
This performance was done very well they were professional. Thing is they werent entertaining. They werent fun. They werent exciting. I wish someone would told them it was a football game not an educational program.
"It was meh, dragged on too long, songs weve heard a million times, i tried to watch it just now, got bored, and bailed halfway through, the coolest part was Samuel L Jackson, and he didn't get to do much."
You know for a FACT his neck popped when he looked at the camera
I love it if someone Mr. Lamar
The best thing ever to happen in hiphop
Why is the superbowl famous ? Is it international sport or so called american world cup
Say drake........
subhuman music for subhuman people
Mesmerised. Mesmerised. Mesmerised.
this was one of the best sb performances. bravo
Winning 5 Grammys in one song is crazy keep the work up
Im here again!!!
Lil Wayne couldnt have done anything close to this
Who else here back again mern
il y a une raison pour la quel la fin est le moment le plus vue ?
I just wanna know who choreographed this cause its quite possibly the best thing Ive seen in my 23 years of living
"The girls too cute, and I love their voices. Blakk woman, and Blakk man stand up. Like Kendric said, "" God is going to favor Blakk people this time around?"
MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD
Is it just me or does uncle Sam seem like he is in a movie while eveyone else is at a concert? Or am I just high?
Sooo this is number 33 for me! I cant get enough! All power to Kendrick
sim
How come everyone is getting a lot of likes for any comment
"nah that devious smile when he says say drake, I hear you like em young. is CRAZYYYYY"
"Im from Asia, I didnt know drake until one day i saw this on my feed."
It literally gets better every time I watch it
The ppl that said this halftime show was boring dont gotta life
I never in my life look at super bowl halftime so many times 35 so far lol that man a goat fine af to
Kendrick was so kind to let some football teams play during his concert
Me too.. This gentleman absolutely knows about that of which he speaks... Incredibly genius... Unbelievably so
SZA IS
Im so proud Kendrick. You did an amazing job.
Not 81 million 553 thousand and 377 in 12 days
SAY DRAKE
10:52
SAY DRAKE 10:53

The goat
They got Selena crip walking

The dread head representing lil wayne is insane
Kendrick Lamar everytime I see you I feel so happy and good
The smile DESTROYS me
Kendrick Lamar we love you so much
Everytime the a minor hits it's still loud af! My favorite halftime performance!
Should had have lil Wayne
I'm Prophetic
"Bro was coming for him would love to see beef with him and Eminem, this Kendrick lad has got it!! TOP Man"
Best Halftime show since Paul McCartney!! Prince had the best but this was so entertaining on so many levels!!
Look at his eyes
literally whomst''ve'd?
Walking in new orleans with addicet of La yelling mustard is crazy he predicted the superbowl performance
Ese Cabron la Rompi
"So much of the message behind this performance is flying over people's head is crazy, Americans do be like the internet thinks about them huh.."
WE INCARNATED
Katy Perry is next!
I didn't appreciate the performance when it premiered on the t.v. But every time I feel like watching this performance I appreciate it a lot more than the first time. People want to say that the halftime performance was bad but after re-watching it Kendrick Lamar had put his heart and soul into this performance. I have to admit it did go over my head and everyone else's. But this was definitely a great performance from Kendrick Lamar even for the people who doesn't listen to Hip Hop/Rap music. Especially during Black History Month.
The way the crowd went louder when Sza started singing. The two are just a masterpiece of a duo
Men are back
This halftime was for people of culture regardless of their race. The whole thing is GOATED AF. Keeps getting better and better
6:12 peekaboo
10:00 and let the real show begin
He has good sining
I can't stop watching and I see something new every time! I was so excited I cried after the show on the superbowl and I have watched it at least every other day since!
1:06 years old and I still have no clue how ruthlessly looking forward positively optimistic
Contagious is the only way to describe this
Overrated
SZA and Kendrick Lamar dissed drake hard lol
The camera LOVES Kendrick!
10:22
kendrickkkkk
Now they have to listen simples well done kendrick
Jahop
So only black people
I keep coming back
Peekaboo part is underrated
Turn on his TV off turn his TV off
Never have watched any Superbowl more than once
The lore is crazy
Cant stop watchin lol
My 3rd time watching
"Not a Kendrick fan, not who this was ""for."" But i get it. A few groups I'm in kept saying ""if you thought it was bad it wasn't for you."" That's absolutely what's up there. This was brilliant"
Fooda
Im here everyday since Superbowl Sunday. I feel like those babies felt about the Shark Song. Help
Honestly some of the best production I've seen for a half-time show. SZA wasn't lying when she said he was planning something great
MESSAGE!!!
Cant stop watching it
80 million in 4 days is crazy work. This performance is a huge W for the USA
When bro got sued bc he played thag song W song tho
12 dias 81 view woooooo el mejor

Kendrick Lamar did an amazing job
"Today, February 22, 2025. Over 81 million views. This is insane! K. Lamar is an undeniable genius! PERIOD!"
Why am I getting ads on this when I have YouTube premium??
Next time if you are going to be on the have show play 30 for 30 with sza

The camera work was amazing
Why is there so much football at this concert?
Wow
Give it up for Sza. Tone and Pitch perfect!!!!
These dancers are solid asfKDot did thatLets not forget about MUuussstarrrdddd
"Look at the amount of time you can tell was put into this awesome halftime show! All the movement, the script, the artistry. Kendrick knew the dance moves that worked flawlessly with his dancers. This production crew did their thing!"
Wow Wow Wow
"Kendrick definitely buried himself, this song will forever be his biggest hit and its all thanks to drake"
the say drake with the smile is too cold
The Madonna nod
It's was lite
A snip of Black SNL led me here. I live under a rock.
Il y a longtemps que j'ai entendu un son de ce style aussi BON !

"I have watch this idk how much times, its just so riveting, I love it. Makes me feel so proud."
Welcome to New Orleans where magic happens! Shouts to my family in Compton... Literally!
10:30 uh
Shout out to those dancers!!!
"So glad everyone loved this performance but it was significantly and specifically speaking toward black Americans. Uncle Sam was there to dictate how he moved and the songs he performed, which is why at the end he didnt finish what he was saying because Kendrick was going to do what he wanted anyway (not like us) . Ive heard sooo many of my people say they want to act/look a certain way to be accepted by white america or justify negative stereotypes , its refreshing to see a black man that grew up in the hood be totally himself on this grand stage . Salute Kendrick . Your music truly is uplifting"
1B Cpt in the house
PHENOMENAL PERFORMANCE ..I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING THIS
"this performance is just straight up addicting to watch, the choreograpy, the camera work, everything."
I love Serena. She is a legend
One day I will stop watching this... dang

"Kendrick is inspiring, truly! You go Kendrick!"
It's only 13 minutes why not watch it again and again
Supposedly people hated this show but the views say something different!

"Love the entertainment, fully clothed dancers in sync."
Which shoes are thoseeeee
"My bad y'all, it's ""IMMACULATE CONCEPTION"". Everybody make mistakes sometimes"
"I just realized why he didn't say ""Emasculate Conception""WOW,..........DID Y'ALL GET IT...........GOOGLE IT"
Kendrick been trending for week and counting
Translation anyone?
I understood what he did
13:10 thats all the eagles needed to hear to finish The job!

"oh god i WISH i was there this is absolute cinematic, salute to all the cameramen and choreographers, THE LIGHTINGS TIMING WAS SOOO GOOD ON BEAT!!!"
My very first time watching it and the only super halftime I truly liked a lot that was hot
13:15 Game Over GAME OVER = AN ACT OF GOD = 86 + 41 = 127
This 13 minutes feels like 13 hours like this stuff is actually insanely good
12:55 Mustard REAL I.D. OF MUSTARD = OBEYED PERFECTLY = HOLY GHOST SEAL = JASON CONSECRATED = THE KILLER T-CELL OF GOD = THE ARK OF THE LORD = JASON THE 7TH ANGEL = THE LEGACY OF JASON = 166 + 76 = 242
The energy hits hard
its so good
BRASILLLLL I LOVE KENDRICK

"I've watched this about 20 times, i suspect it will be much more. Love it."
"6:24 Peekaboo PEEKABOO = CURSED = SECRET = BOZRAH = (Book of Jeremiah 49:10-13) BAAL-PEOR = 70 + 34 = 104 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not. Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. Jeremiah 49:10-13 KJV https://bible.com/bible/1/jer.49.10-13.KJV but I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. Amos 1:12 KJV https://bible.com/bible/1/amo.1.12.KJV"
i wish Kendrick did a studio version of the a capella version of man of the garden

Thought he would do Alright
"The feeling Mustard must have felt during the entire beef, Gand album, being IN the halftime show and his name gettin screamed must be surreal af lol"

"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
40 acres and a mule this is bigger than a music lives rent free in my head.
"That's a very nice little show you've got there, too bad it's blocked by all those men a weird ball over each other..."
He should make one song about Diddy for real
Kens wearing Tupac grant hills. The yin yang of black excellence. Dont know if that was on purpose. Maybe stuff just falls in place.
"Hey everyone, back for My daily fix"
Mustaaaaaaaaaaaaard
God I hate the sudden commercials in this video more than ever
Making me work harder. Come on Kenny
First time seeing all the female dancers dressed decently on the stage. Its never happened in recent times.

"Being a product of Compton, this man has me so proud"
"When I first heard Peekaboo on the album, I was like what is this....but that song became my favorite in a couple days"

Certified boogeyman
Best Super Bowl halftime diss
whats that song at the beggining when it zooms into the apple logo??
Finish the text MUSTA finish
I was today years old when I realized there was a guy casually laying on top of the light pole @5:28
"Okay, here's my ""Shut up Grandpa"" moment. I prefer the clean version here, not because I'm totally opposed to cursing or cultural language, but because even with Kendrick Lamar, once the N***a word gets used once, for example, it then gets to be used every third word. There's no moderation in it's use, just from a lyrical, musical standpoint. Also the cleaning up process breeds some extra creativity. That's all."
Kendrick sing they not like us infront of the whole world is crazy Kendrick>drake
81M in 12 days
The background dancers are so funny sped up 2x
I think Gelo swerve-whoa whoa performance what's better at the all-star
LOL DRAKE WAS PROB PISSED WHEN HE SAW THIS
Got my workout on! Thanks Kenrick!!!!
6:57 I love the peekaboooo
"The engineering, set design, camera quality and control, this is Hollywood quality on a live show!!!"
I'm baccccccccck I love this halftime show
The NFL inserting multiple ad breaks into a youtube video that was played on live television without ads. Classic
This deserves 1b views atleast !
He's insanely talented! Genius! Whoooo MUSTARD!!!!!!
I love it!
Kendrick Lamar
OHHHH like it
10:20 He starts not like us
This funeral may last for more than a decade
Cant count how many times ive been here so far
10:56
"little did we know while watching it live, that we were witnessing history. Kenrick dug the hole himself, dragged the body, buried him, and then pissed on his grave."
I don't understand how anyone said this performance was anything less than PHENOMENAL!! TOP NOTCH!! UNREAL!!
", !"
whoa was this a kendrick concert or a football match sheesh
Pushing 40 btw
Im back again & again! Thank you KL.
King kdot
10:49 the one slip up in this show. He called drake a Ho.
El super bowl est increble
"Honestly, I think Kendrick's struggle with the Super Bowl stage is deeper than just trying to please or avoid pleasing anyone. Hes someone whos always been true to his roots, to his community, and to his voice. His work often challenges systemic issues, so putting him in a space thats designed for mass appeal, especially one thats been historically about spectacle over substance, probably felt like a trap. The Super Bowl is a huge platform, but its also a stage where the NFL tends to cater to mainstream, often white, audiences. Kendrick probably wasnt willing to sacrifice the essence of who he is just to put on a show that mightve felt shallow or watered down. Its not about pleasing white people per se, but about staying authentic and not diluting the power of his message. Hes got a lot of integrity, and I think he knew how much influence he has. At the same time, he mightve felt conflicted, knowing the magnitude of the platform and what it could do for his visibility. I wouldnt say its a dont want to please white people thing, but more of a ""staying true to self"" thing. Kendricks not the type to be co-opted, and when hes on that stage, hes not just performing for the sake of entertainment hes got a responsibility to his message and his people."
Kendrick is so wee!
I just hate his feminine jeans
9:58 7:00
not a single white or asian person.
"This video wil surpass Lady Gaga, Katey Perry around 110 M and its coming for Coldplay at 150 M"
He said the 'revolution is about to be televised' and everyone is bashing him up for it but is Americans not protesting the government now and is it not televised? Americans don't know prophecy and messages of their society come from some of these artists.
Guess whos back? Back again type video
"I ain't get it at first, it took about three watches for it to sink in. Everything was pure talent!! best ever."
Bro Im wasnt mad bro
I watched this at least 20 times
07:22 Luther and SZA appearance
13:10 Game Over Drake
"Im wonder how much money payed Sony, Raven, Amazon, Apple for this Black ops 6 subliminal messages show?"
YOU REALLY BOUT A DO IT?
In just under 13 days ( food for thought)....
"""You wouldn't get the picture even if I had to sit you for hours in front of the Louvre."""
"This my 80 million time watching this. So don't feel bad family ,..... The GOAT"
Well Im back to watch this masterful performance again
"Other then Rihannas halftime show, this is hands down one of the best halftime shows I've seen. The energy kdot gave was so contagious it had me hyped up. Now look everybody everywhere on kdot, he deserves it."
It's amazing
Drake prolly should turn the TV off rn
Say Drake
This man wearing mom jeans
"Holy shyte yall, he actually censored himself so well that I find myself adding those little parts in when Im singing to the uncensored or radio versions!"
5:02 5:02 5:02 5:03 5:03 5:03 5:03 5:03 5:04 5:04 5:04 5:04 5:04 5:04 5:05 5:05 5:05

"for my taste, this was probably the lamest half time show i've seen so far"
I have never re-watched a Superbowl half-time show this many times.
12 Tage her - ich kann nicht aufhren es mir anzusehen Wer noch?
Whose here watching this masterpiece again
"This comment is for the people who claimed it was a boring half time show. Did their due diligence, and made their way back"

The more I watch the other's superbowl preformence... The more I start to realize that kendrick preformence is top 3 of all time
Sza have a high voice
Thank you KDot
"No matter how many times I watch, it just keeps getting better"
"Kendrick's cardiovascular endurance and breath control are top tier. Also, if he experienced any performance anxiety, he handled it perfectly."
To some of y'all who don't know what was his first song at the super Bowl it was GNX
I just keep coming back. Its so much I missed the first 72 times I watched.
mustard

"Any time I want to smile and be reminded that there are still people in this world that know what matters, I just watch this"

"Never listened to Kendrick before, read about who he looked up to musically before he started, watched him when a Grammy and ive watched this halftime show. He's really good. I love what he did."
Is that kida at 6:25?
"5:30 What song is they are humming? I can't place it, but that's Lil Wayne & the Cash Money crew in the back."
